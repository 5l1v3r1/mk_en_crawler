SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of five major BiH parties held an unannounced closed-door meeting at the residence of US Ambassador to Sarajevo Douglas McElhaney on Sunday (19 February).
Local media reports suggest it was aimed at overcoming differences concerning proposed constitutional reforms, including restructuring the current tripartite presidency.
The leaders of two Bosniak formations -- the Party of Democratic Action's Sulejman Tihic and the Social Democratic Party's Zlatko Lagumdzija, as well as three Serb ones -- the Serb Democratic Party's Dragan Cavic, the Party of Democratic Progress's Mladen Ivanic and the Union of Independent Social Democrats' Milorad Dodik -- attended.
There were no representatives from three other formations involved in the constitutional reform negotiations:
the Party for BiH, the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH and the Croatian National Community.
Also Sunday, Dodik -- who is Republika Srpska prime minister-designate -- announced that he is nominating Stanislav Cado as interior minister.
He is a co-founder of Dodik's party.

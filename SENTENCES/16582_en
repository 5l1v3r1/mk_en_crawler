BELGRADE, Serbia -- In a rare show of agreement, Serb and ethnic Albanian negotiators praised the latest round of Kosovo talks, which wrapped up in Vienna on Friday (8 September). 
The participants agreed that security zones must be established around Serb monasteries and other cultural centres to prevent further damage to them. 
The chairman of the talks, Albert Rohan, described them as constructive and focused. 
Negotiators meet again this week to discuss issues related to the exact number and borders of municipalities in the province.

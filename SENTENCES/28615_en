LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- EU foreign ministers decided on Monday (June 14th) to invite EU member parliaments to start ratifying the bloc's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia, two years after it was signed.
The difference was the positive assessment UN war crimes tribunal Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz gave of Serbia's recent co-operation.
That prompted Britain and The Netherlands to drop their longstanding opposition to proceeding with SAA ratification.
Brammertz, however, insists that the EU keep pressing Serbia to arrest former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic.
Meeting in Luxembourg, the EU ministers noted that full co-operation with The Hague tribunal is essential to Serbia's further EU integration process.
Separately Monday, Croatian media reported that Brammertz's report on Croatia was favourable enough to convince the EU ministers to allow the start of accession negotiations on the judiciary chapter at the next intergovernmental conference on June 30th.
Brammertz noted that while Zagreb has achieved only limited success in locating the missing "artillery diaries", connected to 1995's Operation Storm, he believes the search will continue.
The ministers also discussed Albania, reiterating concerns about the failure to resolve the ongoing political stalemate.
The council concluded that despite the return of opposition Socialist Party lawmakers to parliament, the crisis over electoral transparency still jeopardises EU integration.
In general, the Council welcomed efforts by Balkan countries to implement reforms in key areas, stressing the importance of overcoming challenges in the areas of rule of law, corruption and organised crime.

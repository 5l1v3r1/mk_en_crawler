ATHENS, Greece -- Protests at several prisons turned violent earlier this week, forcing authorities to send in riot police.
Local media reported on Wednesday (April 25th) that inmates at Athens' Korydallos Prison had climbed to the roof and begun destroying property.
The protests began on at the Malandrino Prison on Monday when prisoners demanded better living condition and shorter sentences.
Street protests erupted as well on Wednesday, with about 70 people, shouting slogans on behalf of the prisoners, rampaging through an area in downtown Athens.
Justice Minister Anastassis Papaligouras says the government will conduct a review of the prison system.
In other news Wednesday, anti-terror police detained 75 immigrants, most of them Iraqis, over a purported terror plot targeting the US Embassy in Athens.
Police had blocked off and searched the embassy area after an Iraqi tipped them about a possible bomb attack, but found nothing.
Also Wednesday, two elderly nuns were found murdered at their convent near Astros, in southern Greece.
The women were killed in their beds, likely during a robbery, as several doors were forced open and the monastery's church was ransacked.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- New Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic announced a package of measures to tackle organised crime on Wednesday (October 29th). 
They include establishing special anti-mafia courts, improving witness protection programmes and reforming the police force. 
Simonovic said special departments would begin functioning at municipal courts in Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek to deal with organised crime and corruption cases. 
The government will also initiate new legislation that will allow confiscation of criminals' property, Simonovic told parliament, adding there will be closer monitoring of communications between inmates jailed for organised crime and their outside contacts. 
"The situation is serious, and there is no time to lose. 
Organised crime has spread so much that it is threatening our citizens' security and our European ambitions," he said.
Later Wednesday, Croatian state television reported the arrests of four men suspected of involvement in last week's mafia-style murder of journalist Ivo Pukanic. 
The owner and former editor-in-chief of the Nacional weekly often wrote about corruption and human rights violations.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus discussed preparations for starting negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and EU security chief Javier Solana on Thursday (30 June). 
During his visit to Brussels, officials confirmed to Labus that the doors of the EU remain open. 
Rehn pledged to ensure that SAA talks begin on 5 October, the anniversary of the ouster of the Milosevic regime and the start of democratic reforms in Serbia. 
SAA negotiations are expected to last for nine months.
In other news, the United States decided to lift the last of the sanctions it imposed on the former Yugoslavia in 1992. 
The move means that a range of products exported from Serbia-Montenegro would receive duty-free treatment.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- US troops are taking part in military exercises on the territory of former Warsaw Pact members Bulgaria and Romania this month.
Washington has sent some 700 soldiers to join the Bulgarian Army in conducting armoured warfare exercises.
Another 1,700 US and 400 Romanian personnel start an urban warfare exercise on Tuesday (19 July).
General James Jones, the US and NATO military commander in Europe, called the joint manoeuvres and potential deployment of US bases in the two countries part of the "eastward shift in the centre of gravity" for US military policy.

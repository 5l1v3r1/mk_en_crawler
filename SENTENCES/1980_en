As part of efforts towards protecting the country's natural resources, Macedonia's environment and physical planning ministry has issued a decision banning the production, sale and use of detergents containing phosphate levels of more than 0.5 per cent.
The rule goes into effect on 1 June.
Five months later, on 1 November, a ban on the import of such detergents will become applicable -- potentially affecting international producers such as Proctor & Gamble, Henkel and Saponia.
"Decreasing phosphate levels in detergents is not the only measure to protect water from aging," Environment Minister Zoran Sapuric said.
"But for Macedonia, where a small part of communal waste water is purified, this is the most economic and fastest way for its protection."
Up to 50 per cent of phosphorus in the water in three Macedonian lakes -- Prespa, Ohrid and Dojran -- come from phosphate detergents.
Phosphorus levels in one of the lakes, Prespa, has reached alarming levels in recent years, according to experts.
"Detergents often contain a 30 per cent solution, including phosphorus, which is harmful for ecosystems â€¦ it contributes to an abundant growth of flora, thus interrupting the ecosystem and making surface waters become swamps," says Professor Josif Tanevski, the head of a study on the issue.
The rule also complies with EU standards.
Phosphate detergents have long been prohibited in member states of the Union.
Phosphorus will be replaced with zeolite, a substance that provides the same quality but without harming the environment.
Currently, only one Macedonian firm, OHIS, is producing eco-friendly detergents.
"We have invested 520,000 euros for adjusting the stations for production of non-phosphate detergents," says OHIS director Jorgo Kjuka.
"Eco-gong is the first non-phosphate detergent in Macedonia and we have been producing it for three years now."

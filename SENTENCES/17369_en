SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission on Wednesday (May 23rd) published the final results of Sunday's European Parliament (EP) elections.
As expected, the centre-right opposition group GERB was confirmed the winner and will receive five EP seats, as will the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party, which finished second.
The predominantly ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms finished third and will get four EP seats, while the ultra nationalist opposition Attack will get three.
The only other party that managed to pass the 5.56% election threshold was the other junior government partner NMS-II, which will get one seat.

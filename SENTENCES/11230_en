NEW YORK, United States -- In a speech to the UN Security Council Friday (27 May), UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said that Kosovo is making steady progress despite persistent challenges. 
He cited progress in most priority fields, including security, freedom of movement and economic issues. 
But he noted that the ability to establish a full multi-ethnic society would remain limited as long as Kosovo Serbs continued boycotting the interim institutions. 
On Saturday, Jessen-Petersen told Serbian media that he expects the UN to soon name a special envoy in charge of evaluating standards' realisation in Kosovo. 
He also called for a meeting between Serbian President Boris Tadic and his Kosovo counterpart Ibrahim Rugova.

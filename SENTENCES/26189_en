BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik, convicted of war crimes by the UN tribunal at The Hague, has won the right to apply for early release from prison, his lawyers announced Sunday (February 14th). 
The right was granted under British law, as Krajisnik is currently serving his sentence in a British prison. 
Krajisnik was arrested in 2000 for the persecution and forced deportation of non-Serb civilians during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
Convicted in 2006, he was sentenced to 27 years in prison. 
On March 17th 2009, an Appeals Chamber reduced his sentence from 27 to 20 years. 
In September 2009, he was transferred from the detention facility in The Hague to a British prison.

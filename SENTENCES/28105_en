BELGRADE, Serbia -- Mladjan Dinkic was re-elected on Sunday (May 16th) as leader of the ruling coalition member G17 Plus at the party's congress in Belgrade.
Delegates also chose three deputy presidents -- Verica Kalanovic, Suzana Grubjesic and Snezana Samardzic Markovic.
Before the congress, Dinkic was elected president of the newly established United Regions of Serbia (URS), comprised of several national, local and regional parties and groups of citizens.
Dinkic says its goal will be a pro-European, democratic Serbia that will stress decentralisation, boosting local governments.

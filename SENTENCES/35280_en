BUCHAREST, Romania -- The British Embassy in Romania said on Thursday (17 June) that government representatives would soon arrive in Bucharest for talks on ending the stalemate in granting business visas to citizens of Bulgaria and Romania.
The issue emerged following a visa misappropriation scandal earlier this year.
A report presented in London Thursday by British Home Secretary David Blunkett concludes the selection criteria for this kind of visa request will become more restrictive.

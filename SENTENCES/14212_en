SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A total of 326 victims of the December tsunami in Thailand have been identified through DNA analysis in a sophisticated Bosnian laboratory, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) said Tuesday (13 September).
In May, the ICMP agreed to assist the Thai government in the identification process.
Samples taken from more than 1,500 victims were transferred to the Bosnian lab.
In other news Tuesday, the BiH Court confirmed an indictment against former Bosnian Serb army member Marko Samardzic for war crimes committed against Bosniak civilians.
He is charged in connection with the 1992 detentions, maltreatment and murders of Bosniaks in the Kljuc municipality, site of several mass graves.

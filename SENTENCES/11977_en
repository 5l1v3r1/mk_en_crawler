BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva said Thursday (16 December) that the country is likely to sign an accession treaty with the EU in April.
The European Council has not yet taken an official stand on the issue, but has apparently reached a political agreement.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said Bulgaria should sign the Treaty next spring, though he did not specify a date.
Also Thursday, the finance ministry announced that Bulgaria failed to reach an agreement with the IMF on a review of its stand-by programme.
Finance Minister Milen Velchev said the IMF is unhappy with the spending policy for 2005, especially a 25 per cent hike in the minimum wage.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said on Monday (November 15th) that parliament may approve a pardon for tax evaders in an effort to recover revenue owed to the state. 
The pardon would cover fines on unpaid taxes, social security premiums, traffic fines, water and other utility bills. 
If the measure is passed, the evaders would have to pay only the original amount of the unpaid taxes, in smaller instalments. 
Babacan refused to specify the exact sum the government hopes to recover, but denied media reports it could reach $35 billion.

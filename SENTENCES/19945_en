BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU and NATO urged all parties in the region to remain calm over Kosovo's declaration of independence, according to separate statements early Monday (February 18th). 
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said "this is not a race" to recognition. 
"We are involved in trying to secure the stability of a very volatile region at a critical period," he said. 
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said he has contacted leaders in the region in a bid to guarantee stability. 
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also called for moderation and restraint.
EU foreign ministers convene in Brussels on Monday to discuss Kosovo. 
According to unofficial sources, the ministers will come up with a statement suggesting that each member state has the right to decide for itself whether to recognise Kosovo. 
It is expected that 20 of the 27 EU members will recognise Kosovo as an independent state.

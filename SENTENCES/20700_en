ATHENS, Greece -- Metropolitan Ieronymos of Thebes and Livadia, 70, was elected new Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church on Thursday (February 7th). 
Ieronymos succeeds conservative Patriarch Christodoulos, who died late last month after a seven-month battle with cancer. 
Ieronymos was elected in the second round, defeating the Metropolitan of Sparti, Efstathious, who was a close associate of Christodoulos.

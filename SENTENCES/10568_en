ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called for the creation of a national front against corruption, while addressing a meeting of the ruling New Democracy's parliamentary group Thursday (14 October).
"Corruption hurts the economy, society and the quality of democracy", he said, adding that the ruling party is open to co-operation with everyone.
Earlier this week, parliament launched an inquiry commission to investigate weapons procurement procedures during the previous administration led by PASOK.
Also Thursday, Greek police acknowledged for the first time that they received 82 bomb threats during the Olympics, including one regarding the opening ceremony.

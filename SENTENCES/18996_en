BUCHAREST, Romania -- Following weeks of criticising other ruling coalition partners, the minor Conservative Party (PC) finally decided on Sunday (December 3rd) to leave the coalition cabinet of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu.
A PC spokesman says all its representatives would immediately resign from the government.
PC says it was frustrated that other coalition partners constantly rejected its draft laws.
Later Sunday, Tariceanu and President Traian Basescu held an emergency meeting.
PC's move threatens to leave the coalition cabinet without a parliamentary majority in either the Senate or the Chamber of Deputies.

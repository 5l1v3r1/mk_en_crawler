BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu told visiting Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski on Monday (27 February) that borders in Southeast Europe should not be redrawn. 
Romania, he said, supports the granting of a "negotiated autonomy" to Kosovo in compliance with relevant EU standards. 
Basescu also urged the EU to make enlargement in the direction of the Western Balkans a top priority. 
This would strengthen security and stability in the area, he said.
In other news, the Serbian Parliament voted unanimously on Monday in support of a report by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica which opposes independence for Kosovo. 
The prime minister reiterated Serbia's offer of far-reaching autonomy for the province. 
Serbian President Boris Tadic, who also attended Monday's parliamentary session, told deputies that he would not sign any document stipulating independence for Kosovo.

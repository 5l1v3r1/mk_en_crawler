STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday (December 22nd) that the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), created as an annex to the Dayton Peace Agreements, discriminates against minorities.
The court upheld a complaint filed in 2006 by Dervo Sejdic, who is of Roma origin, and Jakob Finci, who is Jewish.
They claimed that the constitution does not allow people who are not Bosniaks, Croats or Serbs to participate in elections for the tripartite presidency or for the upper house of parliament.
The review by the court concurred that the constitution stipulates those seats are reserved for the three constituent people, acknowledging however that "this system, put in place at a time when a fragile ceasefire had been accepted by all parties ...
pursued the legitimate aim of restoring peace." The court ordered BiH to pay 20,000 euros to Finci and 1,000 euros to Sejdic to cover costs and expenses.
It also urged BiH to reform the constitution and guarantee equal representation for all.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission confirmed on Tuesday (May 19th) it has received Slovenia's formal response to EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's proposal for resolving the long-standing border dispute with Croatia.
The proposal envisions international arbitration on the issue.
Croatia accepted Rehn's offer on May 8th, but Slovenia submitted some amendments to it.
Rehn said on Tuesday that Brussels will carefully review Ljubljana's final response but declined to say whether Slovenia had accepted the proposal for an ad hoc tribunal.
The dispute, which has stalled Croatia's EU accession bid, concerns the exact location of the countries' maritime borders.

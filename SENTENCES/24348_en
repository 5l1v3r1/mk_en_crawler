ATHENS, Greece -- The country faces the threat of a H1N1 flu pandemic, given new cases of transmission among Greeks, as opposed to those coming from abroad, local media quoted Health Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos as saying on Friday (July 10th). 
He said up to one third the population could be infected with the swine flu virus in a pandemic that could last for 12-15 months. 
The minister also warned that if the virus changed and became more aggressive, up to 54 % of the population might be infected. 
"We cannot rule out possible fatal cases in Greece as a result of the new flu," he told a press conference.
There are now 201 reported cases in Greece, 78% of which were people who had travelled to Greece from abroad, Avramopoulos said. 
In the last two weeks, authorities observed an increase in secondary transmissions of the virus, as well as micro-epidemics.

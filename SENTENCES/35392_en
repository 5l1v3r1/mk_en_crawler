MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Investigators were searching for clues that would explain why a Jordanian policeman opened fire on American fellow officers in Mitrovica on Saturday (17 April), killing two of them and injuring nine others.
A UN police spokeswoman said Sunday that the killer's motives remained a mystery.
Four other Jordanians who were at the site have been detained.
Police have asked the UN to waive their diplomatic immunity so that they could be questioned.

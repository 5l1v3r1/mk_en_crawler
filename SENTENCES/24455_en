TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Wednesday (June 10th) that his government will continue efforts to fight corruption. 
But USAID has warned that Albania may fail to qualify for US assistance for not fighting corruption as effectively as necessary. 
USAID Mission Director Robert Mahoney says that Albania, as a NATO member, should do much more in this area.

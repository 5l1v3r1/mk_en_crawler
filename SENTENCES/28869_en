NEW YORK, United States -- Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) President Patrick Robinson presented the 17th annual report on the tribunal's work to the UN General Assembly on Friday (October 8th). 
Robinson said all trials at the tribunal should be completed in 2012, with the exception of the trial of Radovan Karadzic. 
The former Bosnian Serb leader's trial should wrap up sometime towards the end of 2013, with all appeals expected to be completed by the end of 2014. 
According to Robinson, unfavourable delays in the case mean this date will have to be re-assessed. 
He mentioned some unforeseen factors affecting the proceedings, such as the recent discovery of Ratko Mladic's military diaries, as well as cases of witness intimidation, failure of witnesses to appear and illnesses.

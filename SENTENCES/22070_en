LONDON, United Kingdom -- Former UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari said on Sunday (October 19th) Serbia must agree to Kosovo's independence if it wants to join the EU.
Belgrade has no option but to accept this, Ahtisaari said to The Guardian.
"You can't be poking the EU in the eye [while] saying you want to join the EU," he stressed.
It does not matter that only 51 of the UN's 192 member states have recognised Kosovo's independence, he added, saying "Well over 65% of the wealth of the world has recognised it.
That's what matters." Ahtisaari won the Nobel Peace Prize ten days ago for his diplomatic efforts over the past three decades, including his work involving Kosovo.

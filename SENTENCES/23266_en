LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Borut Pahor reiterated on Thursday (May 28th) that Croatia should withdraw controversial documents on the bilateral border issue that Zagreb submitted to the European Commission, if it wants EU accession talks to continue. 
He also urged Croatia to discuss amendments Slovenia offered to EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's proposal for resolving the maritime border dispute. 
Pahor said that the final offer should reflect the interests of the Slovenian side. 
The foreign ministers of Croatia and Slovenia briefed Rehn this week on their responses to his latest proposal, which envisions establishment of an ad hoc five-member panel to arbitrate the matter. 
Croatia accepted the offer as final and rejects any Slovenian changes to it.

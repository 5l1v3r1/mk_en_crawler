ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief Prosecutor Mladen Bajic said on Tuesday (January 9th) that local authorities are investigating information about the role former Croatian paramilitary commander Tomislav Mercep may have played in crimes committed against Serbs in Croatia in the early 1990s.
The claims appeared in a recently declassified report by the US intelligence agency, the CIA.
Bajic spoke to reporters amid media claims that the report suggested Mercep had been involved in crimes against Serbs in Pakracka Poljana, Gospic, Vukovar and Zagreb between late 1991 and early 1992.
Mercep, now chairman of an association of Croatian Homeland War volunteers, refused comment Tuesday.

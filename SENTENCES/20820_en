ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new ruling coalition government will be officially formed on Tuesday (January 8th) when the Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Peasant Party and the Social Liberal Party are expected to sign a final agreement.
According to local media reports, this would clear the way for parliamentary approval a few days before the official January 15th deadline for forming the government, following late November elections.
Reportedly, the new cabinet will include representatives from ethnic minority and Serbian parties.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Sunday (May 23rd) that the June 2nd EU-Western Balkans conference in Sarajevo could be an important turning point for the region.
According to him, the EU's goal is to guarantee stability and prosperity in the Balkans.
In an interview with the Zagreb-based daily Vjesnik, he urged Bosnian leaders to demonstrate their readiness for reconciliation and to agree on the thorny issue of state and military property.
Inzko added that he expects progress in BiH's EU visa liberalisation process during the conference.
On Monday, he addresses the UN Security Council and meets with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU warned Croatia on Friday (11 October) that it must respect its obligation to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
"Failure to co-operate fully with the court would greatly affect Croatia's further movement toward the EU," said a statement released after a meeting between EU officials and Prime Minister Ivica Racan. 
At issue is an indictment and arrest warrant issued by the tribunal against retired Croatian Gen Janko Bobetko. 
Racan reiterated his cabinet's promise to work with the tribunal and avoid international isolation. 
But the next day the government denied a report by state television that authorities had reached an agreement with Hague prosecutors which would allow the elderly Bobetko to enter a plea by videoconference.

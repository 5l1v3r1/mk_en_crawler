BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Social Democratic Party (PSD) submitted a no-confidence motion against the government of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Monday (September 24th).
The move came after a series of delays and debates within the party over the chances of bringing down the government.
The no-confidence motion, dubbed "100 days of chaos", needs 232 of the total 463 votes in parliament to succeed.
The PSD has 146 seats in the two chambers and hopes to attract about 100 votes from other parties.
A vote is expected next week.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Chief prosecutor Vesna Medenica presented her annual report to Parliament on Wednesday (June 13th), criticising local courts.
She cited what she said were unjustified extensions, with cases dragging on for as many as 12 years.
As of last year, the courts managed to complete only 52.5% of all pending cases, the report said.
However, the report also said 20 indictments against 120 individuals suspected of involvement in organised crime were filed last year, up by 118% compared to 2005.

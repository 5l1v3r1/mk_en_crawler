ANKARA, Turkey -- About 470 Turkish citizens arrived home early Thursday (June 3rd) from the ordeal aboard the aid flotilla bound for Gaza.
Israeli commandos boarded the ships early Monday, killing nine passengers.
The rest were detained and then gradually released.
Four members of the Turkish parliament were among those who returned home Thursday morning.
Turkey plans to seek an international and independent probe against the Israeli attack and says it will pursue all necessary diplomatic, economic and political measures to achieve that goal.
Parliament is demanding that Israel offer an apology and compensation to the victims.
Athens announced on Wednesday it has complained to Israel about the alleged mistreatment of Greek citizens aboard the flotilla.
A plane carrying 35 activists, including 31 Greeks, three French and one US national, returned to a military airport in Athens early Thursday.

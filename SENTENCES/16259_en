ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new OSCE report praises the level of progress achieved by Croatia's democratic institutions in terms of civil society, police and media. 
OSCE envoy to Zagreb Jorge Fuentes said on Tuesday (13 June) that the document, to be officially presented to the OSCE headquarters in Vienna on Thursday, hails the establishment of a legal, financial and policy framework by the domestic authorities. 
It also identifies problematic areas such as refugee return, war crimes trials and minority rights. 
Many Serbs, he noted, feel subject to discrimination.
In other news Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told visiting Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader that Berlin supports an accelerated EU accession for Croatia. 
Sanader reiterated that 2009 remains a realistic target year.

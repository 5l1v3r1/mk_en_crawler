ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament has launched the official procedure for holding presidential elections. 
Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan says the deadline for submitting nominations is midnight Sunday (August 19th). 
The first round of voting is scheduled for the next day, with subsequent rounds scheduled soon after if needed. 
On Monday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan convenes the cabinet and the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) leadership to discuss the election process. 
He has hinted the AKP may nominate more than one candidate, following its failed attempt to get Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul elected president in the spring.

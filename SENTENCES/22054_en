PRISTINA, Kosovo -- As the new constitution took effect on Sunday (June 15th), President Fatmir Sejdiu signed 41 laws involving statehood, 22 derived directly from the supervised independence plan of former UN envoy for status talks Martti Ahtisaari. 
"This is an historic moment for Kosovo and the most important event since the declaration of independence and so completes the statehood cycle of Kosovo," Sejdiu said. 
Among the laws he signed were those disbanding the Kosovo Protection Corps and founding the Kosovo Security Forces, which is to be operational in 16 months.

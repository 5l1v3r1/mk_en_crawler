WASHINGTON, United States/SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic on Friday (November 9th) condemned the initialling of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
During his visit to Washington, Silajdzic stated that upon signing the document, the Union has ignored the failure of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's government to fulfil its promises to catch war crimes suspects.
Silajdzic said he sent a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barosso to express his disappointment.(Dnevni Avaz, NTV Hayat, RTRS, SRNA, Fena, Tanjug - 10/11/07;

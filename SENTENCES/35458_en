SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Union for Macedonia (SDSM) party said it hopes the junior government partner, the Democratic Union of Integration (DUI), will support Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski in the 28 April presidential runoff. 
SDSM spokeswoman Radmila Shekerinska said Thursday (15 April) that the party believes public satisfaction with Crvenkovski's government as a whole helped DUI candidate Gezim Ostreni during Wednesday's first round. 
Crvenkovski faces Sasko Kedev of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE in the runoff.
In other news Thursday, Macedonian aviation authorities began discussing a report Bosnia and Herzegovina investigators compiled regarding the 26 February plane crash near Mostar that killed Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski. 
Details have not been released.

Former Yugoslav child-prodigy violinist Stefan Milenkovic joined forces with renowned Bosnian lute and guitar player Edin Karamazov on a regional tour this summer.
Their concerts showcased a broad selection of 20th century music -- from Hungarian composer Bela Bartok to California minimalist Terry Riley, Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar and tango great Astor Piazzola.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Council of Europe (CoE) Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg on Friday (February 12th) urged EU member states to stop the forced repatriation of Kosovo citizens, arguing that this only worsens the economic situation. 
"Kosovo is not ready to receive a larger scale of people returning from other countries at this stage," Hammarberg said in Kosovo where he wrapped up a three-day visit Saturday. 
Four of every 10 people in Kosovo are unemployed and the return of former citizens would have enormous impact on the country, the EU official explained.

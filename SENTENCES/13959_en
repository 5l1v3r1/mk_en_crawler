NEW YORK, United States -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced satisfaction with the arrest of Ante Gotovina, saying it proves the credibility of Croatia's government, which had maintained for months that Gotovina was not in the country.
For his part, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Croatia hopes to join the EU by 2009.
On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives adopted a resolution recommending Croatia's fast entry into NATO.
The resolution outlined progress made in meeting political, economic, military and other membership criteria.
Separately on Thursday, in a statement to the UN Security Council on Thursday (15 December), chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte officially thanked the governments of Croatia and Spain for their help in arresting fugitive Ante Gotovina last week.
She said Zagreb submitted key information regarding Gotovina's whereabouts in late September, prompting her to issue a positive assessment regarding Croatia's co-operation.

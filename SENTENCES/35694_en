BUCHAREST, Romania -- The World Bank resident office in Romania said Monday (2 February) the Bank would agree to finance the country's second-pillar pension reform. 
Romania plans to introduce mandatory insurance contributions to private pension funds. 
The so-called second pillar will pay supplemental pensions calculated on the basis of individually capitalised accounts. 
The base pension payments will remain under the state-administered pay-as-you-go system.

NEW YORK, United States -- The United Kingdom's ambassador to the UN said on Wednesday (April 4th) that consultations are under way in the Security Council about sending a fact-finding mission to Pristina and Belgrade, most likely by the end of the month.
Emyr Jones Parry, the current chairman of Council meetings, acknowledged that a number of members want additional information before discussing Kosovo's future.
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin called for such a mission last week.
In other news, the Decani municipal authorities have offered a reward of 2,000 euros to anyone with credible information about last week's mortar attack on a 14th-century Serb Orthodox monastery, which is on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
Mayor Nazmi Selmanaj condemned the perpetrators.

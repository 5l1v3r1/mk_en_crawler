BELGRADE, Serbia -- Human Rights Watch criticised Serbia for failing to punish crimes against the Albanian minority.
In a report published on Monday (November 3rd), the organisation said that in February and March it received information about more than 200 incidents victimising ethnic Albanians.
The courts issued convictions in only ten of these cases.
In most cases, authorities "appear to have done little to identify or vigorously pursue the perpetrators of attacks" even when police officers themselves witnessed the incidents or had obtained evidence, the report argued.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission's (EC) annual progress report on the Western Balkans will urge Kosovo authorities to strengthen the rule of law, step up the fight against corruption and organised crime and enhance inter-ethnic dialogue, local media reported on Thursday (October 30th), quoting a draft of the document.
The report will also point out that Kosovo adopted its constitution in line with EU standards, following its declaration of independence in February.
In other news, the head of the European Parliament's committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, visited Pristina on Wednesday.
She ruled out any neutral status for the EU's EULEX mission, saying it "would not have existed if it was not for [former UN envoy Martti] Ahtisaari's plan".

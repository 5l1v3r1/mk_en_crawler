BELGRADE, Serbia â The trial of former Serb policemen Sreten Popovic and Milos Stojanovic began at the Belgrade war crimes court on Monday (November 13th). 
The two face charges in connection with the 1999 murders of three brothers, Yili, Mehmet and Agron Bytyqi. 
The victims, who were US citizens of Albanian origin, were transferred from prison to hooded Serb troops, who later killed them. 
Popovic and Stojanovic pleaded not guilty. 
Their lawyers say the order for the murders must have come from General Vlastimir Djordjevic, who was in charge of the Serbian police operation in Kosovo. 
Indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, he is thought to be hiding in Russia.

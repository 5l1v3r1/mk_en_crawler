ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's EU reform package will be on parliament's agenda after the national programme for adoption of EU accession criteria is released in mid-June, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday (3 June). 
The prime minister said the legislation reform package would be adopted before parliament goes into summer recess. 
Meanwhile, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin announced Tuesday that a cabinet meeting would be held to discuss the EU reform package. 
The meeting may result in some amendments to the six-point legislation reform proposal, taking the military's objections into account.
In other news, Erdogan said he might be travelling to the US soon in efforts to strengthen relations between the two countries. 
He made the statement during a cocktail party in honour of US Ambassador to Ankara Robert Pearson on Tuesday. 
The ambassador's term of assignment to Turkey has come to an end. 
Pearson said Turkey's policy during the war in Iraq is past and the two NATO members should continue to work together.

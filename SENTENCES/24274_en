SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Tuesday (May 12th) that he has no information about any ongoing investigation against him for alleged abuse of budget funds.
He added he does not recognise the BiH prosecutor's office and court as legitimate institutions.
According to local media, State Prosecutor Hari Furlan is investigating Dodik and 15 other people in connection with fraud worth around 7.5m euros, related to the construction of an administrative centre and the Bosanska Gradiska-Banja Luka Highway.
In other news, High Representative Valentin Inzko told a joint session of the BiH parliament on Tuesday that the country can do more than simply survive and subsist.
He noted that parliament enacted barely 16 new laws last year, only seven of which were European Partnership laws.

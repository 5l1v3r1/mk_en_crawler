SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A UN official deplored on Friday (November 26th) the slow pace of prosecuting rape cases from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
Margot Wallstrom, special representative of the UN Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict, said that in Sarajevo, out of 50,000-60,000 estimated cases of sexual violence only 12 have been prosecuted. 
The UN war crimes tribunal has recognised sexual violence as a war crime. 
Wallstrom was on a three-day visit to BiH where she met with government officials, representatives of civil society, and victims of sexual violence.

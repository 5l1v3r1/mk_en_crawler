ATHENS, Greece -- Seasonal workers with the culture ministry cancelled their 24-hour strike Thursday (March 12th), which had closed one of the country's most popular tourist sites -- the Acropolis. 
The protestors were demanding permanent contracts and back wages. 
Culture Minister Antonis Samaras assured them the government would undertake measures to address their concerns through a bill that he says parliament will table soon.

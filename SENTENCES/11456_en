BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The four parties in Serbia's ruling coalition announced on Monday (23 May) that they would oppose a proposal from the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party to open a debate on a vote of no-confidence against the government.
Parliament is to vote on the proposal Tuesday.
The government partners say the initiative will fail in light of recent positive developments, especially the favourable EU feasibility study.
In other news, US officials announced on Monday that Serbia has arrested and extradited a Bosnian man wanted in the United States for vehicular homicide.
Police say the man was driving under the influence of alcohol when he struck a car full of Minnesota teenagers in 2003, killing one of them.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main ethnic Albanian party in Macedonia, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), will soon return to Parliament after a lengthy boycott, A1 TV reported on Tuesday (May 22nd). 
According to DUI leader Ali Ahmeti, the decision stems from EU and NATO pressure, regarding the need for dialogue and tolerance. 
He criticised the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, however, saying that by inviting the Party of Democratic Prosperity, a former DUI ally, into the government, VMRO-DPMNE is trying to create tension between the Albanian parties.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader rejected the possibility of holding a nation-wide referendum on NATO entry, stressing on Monday (August 6th) that such a move is not envisioned in the constitution and would be unnecessary.
Sanader was responding to statements by the main opposition Social Democratic Party, which promised to organise a referendum on NATO entry if it comes to power after the November general elections.
"This is a cheap election campaign trick and demagogy," Sanader said.
Croatia, along with the other two Adriatic Charter signatories -- Albania and Macedonia -- hopes to get a membership invitation during NATO's Bucharest summit in April 2008.

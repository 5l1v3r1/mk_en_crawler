PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX officials said on Monday (May 24th) they were not informed in advance of Serbian politician Vojislav Kostunica's Sunday campaign trip to northern Kosovo.
EULEX spokeswoman Kristiina Herodes was responding to criticism from Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi who accused the mission of failing to react.
EU Special Representative Office spokeswoman Julia Rueter says Serbian officials did not follow procedure and submit a request to enter Kosovo.
Kostunica, leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, visited northern Mitrovica and Zvecan to campaign ahead of Serb elections that will be held there at the end of the month.

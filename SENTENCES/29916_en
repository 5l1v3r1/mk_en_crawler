SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After a nearly two-year-long boycott, lawmakers from the ethnic Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) will return to parliament soon, party leader Menduh Thaci announced on Saturday (March 26th). 
"We will return to put an end to this circus that has been going on for the past two or three months, and to prove that we are ready to go to elections," Thaci told reporters in Tetovo. 
DPA launched its parliamentary boycott in 2009, frustrated that its efforts to make Albanian a second official language in Macedonia have been thwarted.

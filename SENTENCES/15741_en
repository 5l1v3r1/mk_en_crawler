BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) is seeking a government shuffle, according to a statement from UDMR leader Marko Bela on Tuesday (20 June). 
He said that his party would back the initiative if it was initiated by senior coalition partners -- the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. 
Unless the coalition moves to strengthen the government, the only viable solution to government "inefficiency" would be the holding of early parliamentary elections next year, he added.

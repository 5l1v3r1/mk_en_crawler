SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chief international officer Paddy Ashdown said on Thursday (6 November) that he would block attempts by the government of Republika Srpska (RS) to increase wages and pensions by 20 per cent. 
"Don't commit financial suicide. 
Step back now. 
If you don't then I will be forced to intervene," he said at a press conference in Sarajevo. 
Ashdown warned that a pay raise would cancel the country's stand-by agreement with the IMF that requires tight fiscal discipline. 
RS could also forfeit 100m euros in other financing.
In other news Thursday, the RS Parliament appointed a committee to draft changes to the entity's constitution that would open the way to reform of the armed forces. 
Control of the RS Army would be passed on to the BiH tripartite presidency. 
Establishing a central command structure for the armies of the Muslim-Croat and Serb entities would in turn pave the way for BiH to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.

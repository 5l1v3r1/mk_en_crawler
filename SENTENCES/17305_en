SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Ali Ahmeti, the leader of the main ethnic Albanian opposition group, Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), says significant progress has been made in political dialogue with the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and that an agreement is close. 
Ahmeti added that DUI and VMRO-DPMNE have overcame differences on matters that concern ethnic Albanians, such as the use of Albanian as a second official language, and the status of former ethnic Albanian rebels. 
He added that his party would likely end its several-month boycott of Parliament and return to the legislature very soon.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a visit to Podgorica on Tuesday (5 April), Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov declared that once his country seals the EU Accession Treaty and becomes a EU member, it would lobby in favour of the accelerated integration of the remaining countries in the region. 
Parvanov's statement came after talks with Serbia-Montenegro counterpart Svetozar Marovic and Montenegrin counterpart Filip Vujanovic.
On Wednesday, the three presidents were due to attend a ceremony in Prijepole commemorating the first anniversary of a bus accident at Montenegro's Lim River that killed 12 Bulgarian children. 
Local villagers who rushed to the rescue are being honoured.

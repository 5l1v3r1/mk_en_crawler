THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Friday (April 16th) it will rule on an appeal by former Macedonian security official Johan Tarculovski on May 19th.
He was given a 12-year sentence for a police attack on the Albanian-populated village of Ljuboten, near Skopje, during the 2001 conflict between Macedonia's security forces and Albanian guerrillas.
Tarculovski appealed the sentence in August 2008.

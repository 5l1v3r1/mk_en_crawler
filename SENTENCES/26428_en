PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government plans to propose establishing special relations with Podgorica, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said in an interview with the Podgorica-based daily Dan on Saturday (March 13th). 
Dodik said a formal offer to boost ties will be forthcoming. 
RS has already signed a special relations agreement with Serbia. 
Dodik criticised a resolution that Serbia's parliament is expected to adopt soon, one that condemns war crimes committed in Srebrenica in 1995. 
Dodik said this is unacceptable to RS, specifically noting that such a resolution should not include the word genocide.

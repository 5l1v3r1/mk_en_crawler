ANKARA, Turkey -- A domestic airliner went down in a mountainous area near the town of Isparta in central Turkey, killing all 56 passengers and crew aboard. 
The AtlasJet Airline 165-seat MD 83 plane, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, had taken off from Istanbul and was preparing to land at Isparta early Friday (November 30th) when it disappeared from radar screens. 
Helicopters dispatched from Ankara found the wreckage about five hours after the crash. 
There were no survivors among the 49 passengers and seven crewmembers. 
All of the victims were Turkish nationals.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Thousands of teachers gathered in downtown Sofia on Thursday (October 11th) to demand a 100% increase in wages and far more government spending on education. 
The government has offered a pay hike of only 15% in January, followed by a similar raise in July. 
It warns that a steep increase in teachers' salaries will result in freezing wages across the public sector.
The strike, which began on September 24th, has closed schools for three weeks. 
Opposition parties are threatening to file a no-confidence motion over the government's inability to end the crisis in education.

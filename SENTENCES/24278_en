ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Tuesday (May 12th) handed down life sentences to three members of the radical Islamist group Hizbullah, in connection with 32 murders.
Five other defendants were sentenced to between six and 14 years.
All were accused of membership in a terrorist organisation and involvement in the murders of 32 people between 1993 and 2001 in the southern city of Adana and the southeastern town of Batman, as part of Hizbullah's armed campaign against Turkey's secular system.
In other news Tuesday, Bulgaria announced the arrest of a Turkish national who had been sentenced to seven years in prison in Turkey on terrorism charges.
Border police arrested the man, identified only as ME, on Monday, near the northwestern town of Vidin, after he crossed into Bulgaria from Romania.
The suspect was wanted by Turkish authorities on charges of "participating and funding the terrorist organisation THKP/C-Dev-Sol and for committing terrorist activities".
In 2007, a Turkish court sentenced him in absentia to seven years in prison.

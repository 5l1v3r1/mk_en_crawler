SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown amended the country's Civil Service Laws on Wednesday (21 April), following a joint request by the prime ministers of the state and the two entity governments.
The changes provide for the transfer of civil servants from entity ministries to state-level institutions.
Ashdown's office says this will boost the reform process and give the new state institutions -- particularly the BiH Defence Ministry -- necessary resources.

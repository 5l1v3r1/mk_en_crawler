SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) formally confirmed that incumbent Georgi Parvanov of the Socialist Party and ultranationalist Attack coalition leader Volen Siderov will square off in a runoff next Sunday (October 29th). 
The CEC released the final results of last Sunday's first round, in which Parvanov won 64% of the vote, compared to 21.5% for Siderov. 
The level of turnout -- 42.51% -- fell short of the required 50%, forcing the runoff.

TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the Central Election Commission, Ilirjan Celibashi, announced on Saturday (11 March) that he would not seek another term after his current one expires at the end of the month. 
Celibashi again warned that ongoing delays in reforming the electoral process would have negative consequences for the country. 
The restructuring must be completed before local elections later this year.

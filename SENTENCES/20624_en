ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's main pro-Kurdish party, the Democratic Society Party (DTP), suggests that granting autonomy to the predominantly Kurdish southeast could end fighting with guerrillas from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Aysel Tugluk, an influential DTP member of parliament, told a party gathering on Thursday (November 8th) that "a democratic and federal system is the most suitable solution". 
He went on to stress that "everyone knows very well that the solution to the Kurdish problem lies in democratic moves rather than military operations." The party adopted a declaration that officially supports the proposal. 
The DTP has 20 members in parliament, the first pro-Kurdish formation represented there in more than a decade.
In other news Thursday, Turkish police said they detained four people and seized a considerable amount of plastic explosives in the town of Nusaybin, on the Syrian border. 
Police reportedly acted on a tip.

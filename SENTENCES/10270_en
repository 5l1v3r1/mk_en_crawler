ATHENS, Greece -- The leader of the main opposition party PASOK, George Papandreou, has called for reform of the party.
During a visit to northern Greece on Monday (25 October), Papandreou said the party must be restructured in order to prepare for a new government mandate.
"No one at PASOK has a permanent seat.
We are all subject to evaluation," he said, urging young people to be more active in the process.

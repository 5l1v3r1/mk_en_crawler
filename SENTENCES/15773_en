BELGRADE, Serbia -- Representatives of the Serbian government and UNMIK will meet on Friday (November 24th) in Pristina to discuss problems with electricity supplies in Kosovo. 
Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Radomir Naumov said on Wednesday that, after the talks, he would send a draft resolution to EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs.
The energy crisis in the province also was a main topic of discussion in Brussels, at the first working meeting of European Parliament (EP) and Serbian parliament members. 
Belgrade wants a joint team of experts formed to manage the province's power utility, KEK. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, meanwhile, told the EP that Serbia would never recognise independence as a solution to the Kosovo status issue.

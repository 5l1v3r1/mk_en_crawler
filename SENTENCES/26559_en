BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic says he sees EU membership for his country within five to seven years.
In an interview published Tuesday (November 10th) on the website of the European Parliament (EP), Jeremic reaffirmed Belgrade's intention to apply for EU membership by the end of this year.
"It's very difficult to imagine a stable, peaceful and prosperous part of Europe that has a big black hole right in it," Jeremic said, adding he is optimistic that the entire Western Balkans will join the bloc.
In other news Tuesday, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki told members of the EP's Foreign Affairs Committee that Skopje is ready to ramp up its dialogue with Greece on all remaining issues.
As for the upcoming scrapping of visa requirements for Macedonia, Milososki said Skopje is willing to share its experience in the visa liberalisation process with Albania and Kosovo.
He added that Skopje expects the EP's support in receiving a specific start date for accession talks.

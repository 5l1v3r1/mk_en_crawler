BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal (ICTY), Rasim Ljajic, has said that British and other foreign intelligence services are assisting Serbia in the search for Ratko Mladic.
In an interview with Danas daily on Thursday (November 25th), Ljajic said this exchange of information could lead to the arrest of the former Bosnian Serb military commander.
In his latest report on Serbia, ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz says that Belgrade's efforts to locate and detain two remaining war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic "remain problematic".
Mladic has been on the run since The Hague tribunal charged him in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

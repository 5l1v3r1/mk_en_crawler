ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (14 July) to allow the Supreme Court to prosecute two more former cabinet ministers on corruption charges. 
Zeki Cakan and Cumhur Ersumer headed the energy ministry in Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's government, which left power two years ago. 
Both men have denied the charges in speeches to parliament. 
On Tuesday, parliament voted to put former ministers Mesut Yilmaz and Gunes Taner on trial over a bank privatisation scandal. 
The current government has pledged to tackle corruption, and has blamed many of the country's economic problems on abuses of power by former governments.

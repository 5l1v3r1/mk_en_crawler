BUCHAREST, Romania -- The United States and Romania are very close to signing an agreement on establishing joint military bases in the Balkan country, US National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said on Sunday (23 October).
"The framework basically allows access to facilities so as to facilitate co-operation between the forces of the United States and Romania," he told reporters after meeting with President Traian Basescu.
For his part, Basescu reiterated that Romania would continue its participation in international peacekeeping operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In other news, the latest report by the Group of States against Corruption -- the Council of Europe's (CoE) anti-corruption watchdog -- finds Romania has made significant but still insufficient progress in fighting corruption.
The report was presented at the CoE last week.

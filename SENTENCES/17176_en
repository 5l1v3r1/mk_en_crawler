BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Friday (28 April) that the RS government has filed abuse of office charges against BiH Indirect Taxation Authority's (ITA) governing board chairman Jolly Dixon and ITA head Kemal Causevic. 
RS is claiming that its budget suffered losses because of the allocation of revenues from indirect taxes between the entities in 2005 and 2006, and that Dixon made unilateral decisions without the consent of all board members, while Causevic implemented these decisions.
Later Friday, Dixon described the accusations as absurd. 
He noted that since he took over the chairmanship of the ITA board, public revenues in BiH rose by 6.5 per cent and 14 per cent year in year respectively in 2004 and 2005 and that all parts of BiH, including RS, benefited from increased receipts.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police arrested seven people Wednesday (December 16th) suspected of having trafficked a group from Kosovo who drowned in the Tisza River in October. 
EULEX police say the suspects were taken into custody following a series of police operations in several regions Wednesday morning. 
Twelve people died and four others are missing after the tragedy in which a boat capsized as it tried to cross the river between Serbia and Hungary illegally.

VUKOVAR, Croatia -- Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt said Friday (10 September) the ministry is pleased with the work of the Vukovar County Court in conducting war crimes trials. 
She added that court is moving closer to the level of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in hopes the ICTY will transfer the case against Croat Generals Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac to Croatia. 
Skare-Ozbolt says the government plans to allocate additional funds, totalling 4.6m euros, to the 2005 budget for the construction of a court building in Vukovar.

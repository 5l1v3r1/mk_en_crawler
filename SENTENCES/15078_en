BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- An IMF delegation left Belgrade on Monday (31 October) without reaching agreement with the government on a standby loan worth $200m. 
Pirita Sorsa, leader of the IMF team, said progress had been made in the talks, but several issues remain. 
She urged Serbia to cut public spending, the deficit and inflation. 
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said the IMF adjourned the talks because it is waiting for parliament to adopt the 2006 budget. 
The government approved the draft on Friday, claiming it meets IMF requirements.

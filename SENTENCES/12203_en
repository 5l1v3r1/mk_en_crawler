TIRANA, Albania -- The leadership of the ruling Socialist Party decided Thursday (13 January) to postpone the 29 January party congress until April.
A party spokesman said the decision is the result of disputes over election reform legislation.
Changes to the election code will likely to be approved by mid-February.
Also Thursday, Defence Minister Pandeli Majko discussed the issue of chemical weapons with a delegation from EU member states.
At his request, the EU states agreed to help eliminate a stash of newly discovered chemical agents that date back decades.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court on Friday (December 11th) delayed the final announcement of Sunday's presidential run-off results, by ordering the Central Electoral Bureau to recount invalid ballots.
The court had announced on Thursday it was reviewing the results of the run-off.
Incumbent Traian Basescu won a narrow victory with 50.33% of the vote, edging out rival Mircea Geoana with 49.66%.
Geoana's Social Democratic Party (PSD) asked the court to nullify the results, arguing numerous violations affected the outcome.
On Thursday, a parliamentary committee questioned Marcel Opris, the chief of one of Romania's secret services, over allegations linking his agency to election fraud.
The opposition PSD claims that Basescu's Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) had access to voting data through software provided by Opris, something he denies.
His agency monitors all telecommunication networks for the president, government, parliament and top justice officials.
Meanwhile, PSD leader Geoana has endorsed Crin Antonescu, of the National Liberal Party (PNL), as a likely candidate for prime minister.
PNL members have been urging Antonescu to contact the PDL about forming a new government.
This has forced Antonescu to soften his position on a possible PDL-PNL government, which he had previously ruled out.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic on Monday (September 15th) accused Republika Srpska (RS) leaders of trying to secede and submitted a claim in the country's Constitutional Court over this "illegal" act. 
Bosnian Serb authorities "have been trying to represent themselves as a separate independent entity of international law", Silajdzic told journalists, referring to illegal political and lobbying campaigns involving Belgian and US public relations firms. 
Silajdzic said the Bosnian Serb government uses public funds to finance its contract with the United States-based Quinn Gillespie and Associates, worth $1.5m, for the promotion of its cultural, economic and athletic interests. 
Silajdzic is asking the Constitutional Court to annul the agreements. 
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says the contracts are legal and will continue.

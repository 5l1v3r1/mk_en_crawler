TIRANA, Albania -- The education ministry says the Council of Europe (CoE) has advised Albania to review history textbooks used in schools. 
The ministry said on Wednesday (March 26th) that the CoE is concerned about hate speech directed at neighbours in some of the books, rendering them inconsistent with European norms and with Albania's efforts to reinforce democracy. 
The CoE also advised changing some of the curriculum used in schools, to bring it into line with European standards.

ATHENS, Greece -- Vandals have desecrated a Muslim cemetery in the northern city of Komotini, a police source said on Saturday (August 14th).
In all, about ten gravestones were smashed Friday night, which spurred a spontaneous demonstration by around 30 members of the Turkish minority living in the city.
Government spokesman George Petalotis condemned the act, describing it as vandalism on the part of "marginal groups trying to sow hatred".

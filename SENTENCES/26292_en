BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Orthodox Church decided on Saturday (February 13th) to remove Archbishop Artemije from his post as its leader in Kosovo. 
The Holy Synod ruled that the spiritual leader can no longer occupy the post since he is suspected of embezzlement of millions of euros in aid and government money over a period of several years. 
Artemije is known for his hard-line ultra-nationalist and anti-Western views.

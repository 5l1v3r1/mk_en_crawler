Kosovo suffered a 25% drop in foreign investors during 2009 compared to the previous year, according to the trade and industry ministry.

A declining trend has been seen for the past two years, however, with experts citing an unfavourable investment environment, corruption and the grey economy as reasons. 
In 2007, foreign investment amounted to 421m euros, while the following year they sank to 355m euros.

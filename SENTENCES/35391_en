SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the ruling SDSM party and Sasko Kedev of the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE have kicked off their campaigns for the 28 April presidential runoff. 
They are expected to focus on increasing voter turnout, as the rate of 55.14 per cent in the first round was the lowest ever in Macedonia. 
The media reports that the junior government member, the Democratic Union for Integration, has offered to support Crvenkovski in exchange for key posts.
In other news, the defence ministry says it has completed the third phase of its strategic defence review and has drafted a plan to transform the armed forces. 
After a review by the government, the document will be sent to parliament.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (October 10th) that Kosovo must obtain a "clear legal status".
This, he said, would enable the EU to define relations with Kosovo, as the Union needs to have a partner which is legally eligible to negotiate and eventually seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
Such an agreement is considered the first step toward EU integration.
Rehn also said that UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize this year sends a strong political message regarding a sustainable solution to the status issue.
The winner will be announced on Friday.
In Pristina, Kosovo Albanian leaders insisted Tuesday that independence is the only outcome they will accept.
Prime Minister Agim Ceku said that Kosovo has achieved significant progress in the implementation of internationally set standards and must gain its sovereignty next year.

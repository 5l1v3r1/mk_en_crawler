BERLIN, Germany -- The IMF is ready to offer additional aid to Greece should Athens ask for it, Antonio Borges, director of the Fund's European department, told a press conference in Frankfurt on Thursday (May 12th). 
"The Greeks have to take the initiative, and so far they have not approached us," Borges said while presenting the new six-month report on Europe's economic perspectives. 
He reiterated there is no need to restructure Greece's debt. 
Separately Thursday, IMF spokesperson Caroline Atkinson said the Fund has been considering extending the repayment schedule of the 110 billion-euro bailout package Greece received a year ago from the IMF and the EU, if Athens needs more time.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government drafted a pension reform bill Monday (May 10th) as part of sweeping austerity measures to drag the economy back on track. 
Under the package, pensions will be cut, while general retirement age will be raised from 61 to 65 years by 2015. 
"We are facing a historical dilemma -- to allow or to avoid the collapse of the pension system," Employment and Social Security Minister Andreas Loverdos said. 
According to official forecasts, unless measures are undertaking, pension financing will total 13.2% of Greece's GDP in 2020. 
The measure moves next to parliament for consideration.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- After meeting with Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic and BiH Serb presidency member Nebojsa Radmanovic on Tuesday (October 23rd), RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said that at an upcoming emergency session of parliament, entity lawmakers would approve further measures to defend the interests of RS and Serbs, as a constitutive people in BiH.
Dodik said the MPs would also request the closure of the Office of High Representative and would back a decision to pull all RS representatives from state-level institutions, following High Representative Miroslav Lajcak's recent changes to the law on the Council of Ministers.

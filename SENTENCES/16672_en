SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Minister of Environment and Waters Xhevdet Chakurov said on Saturday (October 7th) that the damage caused by the huge Danube oil slick earlier in the week totalled about 1m euros, according to preliminary estimates.
He confirmed that Bulgaria, like Romania, would seek compensation as soon as the source of the pollution and the final assessment of losses are established.
Serbia has admitted to a spill from the Nis oil refinery in Prahovo, but insists the quantity was not enough to cause a slick of that size.

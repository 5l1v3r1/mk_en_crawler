BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen arrives on Wednesday (December 16th) for talks with President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic.
In an interview with B92 ahead of the visit, Verhagen said that the Netherlands will decide whether to unblock Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in June, based on Hague war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz's next report to the UN Security Council.
The Netherlands insists that fugitive Ratko Mladic be arrested first.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) on Sunday (November 2nd) said what it described as the government's poor governance is hampering the country's EU integration process. 
The SP cited a report by the Open Society Foundation on Albania's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) process, which describes the country's judiciary as problematic. 
EU Integration Minister Majlinda Bregu denied claims that EU integration is suffering. 
So far, 22 of the 27 member countries have signed the SAA with Albania.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague will appeal the court's decision allowing Ramush Haradinaj, former Kosovo prime minister, to participate in politics again.
Prosecution spokeswoman Florence Hartmann characterised the decision as unprecedented and urged that it be reversed.
Presiding Judge Carmel Agius echoed that sentiment, saying his colleagues had sent the wrong message to other politicians who are awaiting trial in The Hague.
In its decision Wednesday, the tribunal gave UNMIK the power to decide on Haradinaj's political activity on a case-by-case basis.
Haradinaj surrendered to The Hague tribunal several months ago but was released pending the start of his trial.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish newspaper reported on Thursday (14 August) that the country's military was preparing 10,000 troops for possible deployment in Iraq.
Though top leaders have not made a formal decision on the move, the army has sided with the government in planning to provide assistance to the US-led stabilisation force.
According to media reports, an estimated 4,000 soldiers will eventually deploy in the area between Baghdad, Fellujah and Tikrit.
They could be joined by thousands of other troops from republics in Central Asia and Pakistan and would likely be commanded by a Turkish general.
Parliament must still approve the deployment.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has said the final decision would be made by the end of September.

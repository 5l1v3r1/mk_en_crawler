SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Ante Jelavic, former member of the BiH tripartite presidency, Miroslav Prce, former defence minister of the Muslim-Croat federation, and Miroslav Rupcic, a former insurance company executive, were arrested in the Mostar area on Friday (23 January) for alleged involvement in organised crime.
Local police made the arrests with the help of SFOR personnel.
A police spokesman said the suspects are linked to the case of the Hercegovacka Banka.
It was taken over by BiH's international administration in 2001 when officials found that it had provided financial backing to an attempt by the nationalist Croat Democratic Union to win autonomy for Bosnian Croats.

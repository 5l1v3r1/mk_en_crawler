TIRANA, Albania -- Albania opened a new border crossing with Kosovo on Thursday (June 25th) in the municipality of Dragash.
The Glloboqice-Borje crossing is only for pedestrian traffic during limited periods each day.
The facility is important for the Gorani and Bosnian minority communities, who are concentrated on both sides of the border but have been physically divided for 60 years.

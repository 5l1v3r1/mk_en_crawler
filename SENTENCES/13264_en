SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski and visiting Moldovan counterpart Vladimir Voronin agreed on Tuesday (21 February) that bilateral economic co-operation must be enhanced. 
Though located in the same region, the two countries do not collaborate as they much as they could, the two agreed during Voronin's daylong visit to Skopje. 
They discussed efforts to promote the Macedonian economy in Moldova and vice versa, and signed a series of agreements, including one on mutual avoidance of double taxation.

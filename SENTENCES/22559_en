PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Police have issued an arrest warrant for Predrag Strugar, son of former Yugoslav National Army General Pavle Strugar, on suspicion of war crimes, police spokeswoman Tamara Popovic said on Thursday (August 7th).
Along with seven other people, Strugar is charged with the murder of 23 ethnic Albanian civilians in the village of Kaluderski Laz in Montenegro during the NATO air strikes in 1999.
His father was sentenced by The Hague tribunal to more than seven years in prison for crimes committed during 1991 military operations in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Wednesday (March 31st) ordered the release of nine military officers arrested last month for alleged involvement in a plot to topple the government of the ruling Justice and Development Party.
The group, including three admirals, was detained along with almost 70 other active and retired officers as part of investigations into the so-called Sledgehammer plot, which allegedly aimed to trigger chaos by placing bombs in mosques and museums.
The army denies the existence of a plot.

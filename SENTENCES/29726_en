PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR head Erhard Buhler urged Serbs in Zubin Potok municipality to open up a road they have been blocking for days. 
Buhler attended a joint KFOR-EULEX military exercise on Tuesday (May 24th) saying that KFOR is not going to tolerate the roadblock for long. 
"I can tell you that I don't have much patience," Buhler said. 
They are protesting the arrest of a local fellow Serb, Jermo Pantelic, who EULEX accuses of running illegal smuggling rings for years in northern Kosovo. 
The Serbs insist he should be released.

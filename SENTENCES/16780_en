BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The foreign ministry says Belgium is considering restricting the access of Bulgarian and Romanian workers to its labour market after the two countries' EU accession in January. 
In a statement Monday (November 6th), the ministry said Belgium would likely introduce such restrictions for a two-year period. 
A limit on access by workers from the ten countries that joined the Union in 2004 remains in effect.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A former Bosnian Serb general surrendered to the UN tribunal on Wednesday (23 March). 
Vinko Pandurevic faces the charge of genocide for his alleged role in the Srebrenica massacre. 
He commanded the infamous Zvornik brigade, which overran the Muslim enclave in 1995. 
Pandurevic said in an interview on Sunday that he felt "morally responsible" for the atrocities. 
Charged in 1998, his indictment was unsealed in 2001.

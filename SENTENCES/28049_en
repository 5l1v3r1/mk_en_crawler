ATHENS, Greece -- The public sector union ADEDY announced on Tuesday (September 21st) plans for a 24-hour strike on October 7th to protest government austerity measures that include pension and salary cuts. 
ADEDY also plans a September 29th rally in downtown Athens as part of a European-wide protest against similar measures. 
State railway workers are holding a five-hour work stoppage on Wednesday and Thursday to protest government plans to cut their wages and open the sector to private competition.
Meanwhile, about 2,500 truck owners marched to the parliament building in Athens on Tuesday, the ninth day of a protest against government plans to liberalise their sector. 
There were brief clashes as some in the crowd threw plastic bottles of water and cups of coffee at the police, who responded with stun grenades. 
No arrests or injuries were reported.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague decided Monday (3 February) to go ahead with a case brought by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) against Yugoslavia in March 1993.
ICJ's decision to assume jurisdiction over the lawsuit came in July 1996.
In late 2000, Yugoslavia contested the Court's decision, saying that having obtained membership in the UN in November 2000, Yugoslavia could not be held responsible for the activities of ex-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, when the country was not a signatory under the UN Genocide Convention.
Discussing the request at its Monday session, ten out of the 13 members of ICJ court panel rejected the Yugoslav motive as "inadmissible".
BiH seeks compensation from Yugoslavia for the genocide that was committed on its territory during the 1992-1995 conflict.
About 200,000 Muslims, Croats and Serbs were killed or went missing during that period.
No date has been set for the start of the trial, but observers believe that the hearings could commence before the end of the year.(OHR Sources - 04/02/03;

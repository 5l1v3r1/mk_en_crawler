PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK authorities in the Serb-dominated northern part of Mitrovica on Monday (November 3rd) continued to block attempts by an Albanian to rebuild a house in which he intends to live. 
UNMIK police detained the owner, Ali Kadriu, for several hours for allegedly failing to provide a construction permit to authorities. 
Rebuilding efforts by Albanians in this neighbourhood on the outskirts of Mitrovica have sparked clashes between local Serbs and Albanians for the past two months.
In other news, police say two explosions occurred in the Mitrovica area. 
One powerful blast happened on Sunday evening at a gas station in the village of Zupc, near Zubin Potok. 
The other was in the northern part of the town.

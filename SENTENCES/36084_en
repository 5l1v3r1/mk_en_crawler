SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) nominated a new candidate on Friday (19 March) for the 14 April presidential election.
DPA chose parliament member Zejdi Xhelili to replace Arben Xhaferi, whose candidacy was disputed by the State Electoral Commission (SEC).
In a statement announcing the new choice, DPA accused the SEC of wilfully interpreting laws and deliberately imposing obstacles to Xhaferi's candidacy.
But in response, SEC spokesman Zoran Tanevski pointed out that the commission has not received any official nominations and therefore could not have rejected Xhaferi's.

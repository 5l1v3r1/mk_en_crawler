TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha suggested on Tuesday (18 October) that Kosovo should be granted independence.
Following a meeting with Montenegrin counterpart Milo Djukanovic in Podgorica, Berisha said the status issue "should be solved in accordance with the will of the people", who he said have already "opted for independence many times".
At the same time, Berisha called for guaranteeing the rights of Serb and other minorities in Kosovo, adding that measures should be taken to enable all refugees to return to their homes.

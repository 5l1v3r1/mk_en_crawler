ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis reiterated on Wednesday (30 August) that the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece is not a bilateral but an international issue.
She explained that if the problem were to decide how Greece would refer to Macedonia, then UN Security Council resolutions would be unnecessary, as would negotiations under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.
The two countries have been at odds for 16 years.
Greece insists Macedonia should be referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, so as not to be confused with the Macedonia region in Greece.

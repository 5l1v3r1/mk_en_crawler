BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik said on Friday (April 29th) that the entity would respond if the international community imposes sanctions because of an upcoming referendum on the BiH Court and the Prosecutor's Office. 
Dodik met in Banja Luka with Miroslav Lajcak, European External Action Service Managing Director for Europe and Central Asia, to discuss the current situation in BiH. 
High Representative Valentin Inzko has warned that the EU could impose sanctions if Bosnian Serbs did not give up their plan to conduct the referendum on High Representative-imposed laws. 
During the meeting, Lajcak voiced the international community's concern over RS's decision.

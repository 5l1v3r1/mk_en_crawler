PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Another transmitter owned by the Kosovo mobile telephony provider IPKO was blown up on Sunday (April 25th), this one in the village of Bistrica, in Leposaviq municipality.
On Saturday, a similar attack occurred in Zvecan municipality's village of Rudare, where the same type of explosive is believed to have been used.
IPKO is working closely with police to protect its assets.
A transmitter owned by the operator VALA was also damaged in Leposaviq.
The attacks on Kosovo mobile telephony operators are in response to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) decision to disconnect illegal Serbian operators in Kosovo.
The TRA says these firms have no permission to operate in Kosovo and pay no taxes.
But Belgrade says Serbian mobile operators were granted open-ended licences for transmission in Kosovo long before 1999.
Left without communication, 2,000 Serbs in Gracanica are now using services of the VALA, which has been issuing free SIM cards to local Serbs.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic told a Zagreb court Wednesday (December 1st) that he is not guilty of abuse of power.
The charges stem from a 2004 procurement deal for military trucks.
In his final plea before the court, Roncevic said that the deal was legal and within budget, saying the trucks were ordered to help the country meet NATO standards.
Prosecutors wrap up their case Thursday and Friday.
They maintain that Roncevic and assistant Ivo Bacic abused their power when concluding a "harmful deal" that caused millions of kunas damages to the state budget.
The trial started in January.

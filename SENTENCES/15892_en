BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic headed to Brussels on Thursday (17 August) with a package of proposals aimed at restarting dialogue with the EU. 
She said in an interview that her main task would be to persuade top EU officials that Serbia is committed to reform and deserves a European future. 
This year would be full of challenges, Dulic-Markovic explained, citing talks on the future status of Kosovo, the need to arrest fugitive Ratko Mladic, and restoring negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
She also explained that Belgrade would appreciate the writing off of Serbia's $2.3 billion debt to the Paris Club of creditors.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal's chief investigator, Patrick Lopes-Terres, has been visiting Belgrade this week, meeting with officials in charge of the implementing Belgrade's action plan for co-operation. 
The focus of talks has been on Mladic.

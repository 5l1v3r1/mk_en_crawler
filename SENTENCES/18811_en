BELGRADE, Serbia -- Four political parties representing the 75,000 ethnic Albanian residents of the Presevo Valley in southern Serbia have decided to end their ten-year boycott of Serbian politics. 
The organisations will nominate 250 joint candidates for the general election in January and hope to get at least three seats in the 250-seat parliament. 
An amendment to the election law has made it easier for smaller parties to gain parliamentary representation.

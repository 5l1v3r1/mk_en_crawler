SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's ruling Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) will announce its choice for prime minister-designate on Monday (December 10th), SNSD leader and RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Thursday.
He has suggested he would tap caretaker Council of Ministers' Chairman Nikola Spiric for another term, something the other parties seem to support.
Spiric resigned more than a month ago to protest measures proposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak in response to failed police reform.
The BiH tripartite presidency has given the parties until Wednesday to announce a candidate.

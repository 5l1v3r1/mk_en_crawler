SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak met on Wednesday (February 6th) with NATO Deputy Supreme Commander Europe and Operation Commander of Operation Althea/EUROFOR, General John McColl, to brief him on the current political situation in BiH. 
They discussed the two main challenges the country faces -- the functionality of the state and its EU prospects. 
Lajcak said it is in no one's interest to stand in the way of BiH's European future.

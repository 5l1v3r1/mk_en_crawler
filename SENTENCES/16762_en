HAKKARI, Turkey -- A rally against violence and bomb attacks by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) took place on Saturday (6 May) in the southeast city of Hakkari.
The protest took place several days after a blast there injured 21 people, including 11 children.
The city has been a target of increasing violence lately, blamed on the PKK.
In neighbouring Greece Saturday, scattered clashes occurred between demonstrators and police during an antiwar march organised by the European Social Forum in Athens.
Ten stores and two banks were damaged, and a police vehicle was completely destroyed, in violence that marred an otherwise peaceful march.
Police arrested at least 17 people.

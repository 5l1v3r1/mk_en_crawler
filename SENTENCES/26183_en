DOHA, Qatar -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday (February 14th) that his country is ready to serve as a venue for the exchange of Iranian uranium used for the production of nuclear fuel. 
"The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that Turkey could serve as the centre for the exchange of uranium â€¦ but there is no agreement [between Iran and the West] up until now," Erdogan told a press conference in Doha, where he is making two-day official visit. 
He noted that for several months now Ankara has worked to help settle the Iranian nuclear issue. 
Later Sunday, Erdogan met with US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in Doha, discussing Iran's nuclear programme and other issues.

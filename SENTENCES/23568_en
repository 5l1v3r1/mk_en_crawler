STRASBOURG, France -- EU membership prospects drive stability and reform in the Western Balkans, the European Parliament (EP) said in a report published on Friday (April 24th). 
It stressed that full-fledged EU membership of countries that have met the Copenhagen criteria should not be prolonged or rejected. 
It warned that different levels of integration, especially with regard to visa liberalisation, would lead to new barriers in the region.
The document, drafted by Swedish lawmaker Ana Ibrisagic, also urged Western Balkan countries to finalise co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
It voiced concern over political interference with the media, as well as threats and violence against journalists.

ATHENS, Greece -- A mission of EU and IMF experts has been forced to postpone their trip to Athens on Monday (April 19th) due to the massive cloud of dangerous ash from an Icelandic volcano that grounded air travel across Europe.
The experts, who were supposed to start discussions on a proposed 40 billion-euro aid package, will arrive on Wednesday if conditions improve.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina's eight most influential political parties gathered in Brussels Saturday (12 November) to begin negotiations on constitutional changes. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn characterised the meeting as an attempt to reach a consensus on change, adding that the process should be evolutionary, rather than revolutionary. 
According to the first reports, the BiH leaders reiterated their serious differences on the issue.

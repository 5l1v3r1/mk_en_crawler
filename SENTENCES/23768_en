ATHENS, Greece -- The extremist group Sect of Revolutionaries on Monday (June 22nd) claimed responsibility for last week's murder of police officer Nektarios Savas, media reported. 
The group made the claim in a CD sent to the daily Ta Nea. 
Savas was shot by gunmen on a motorbike last Wednesday, as he guarded the home of a woman who was to testify against her ex-husband, in the trial of the terror group People's Revolutionary Struggle. 
Police had suspected the Sect of Revolutionaries' involvement from the start, as cartridge cases found at the scene matched a gun previously used by the group.
Separately Monday, Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis expressed concern over the rise of ultra-left terrorism, telling radio broadcaster SKAI that authorities must protect democracy in Greece.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ferhat Dinosha, leader of the Democratic Union of Albanians in Montenegro, on Tuesday (13 January) urged authorities to investigate subversive propaganda on a Web site run by a group calling itself the National Army of Montenegro (NAM). 
The organisation threatened to attack institutions in the republic if the rights of the ethnic Albanian minority are not respected. 
Dinosha expressed doubts about whether the group exists at all, noting the Web site contents indicate contributors do not speak Albanian very well. 
The interior ministry issued a statement Tuesday, saying it had no information concerning the existence of NAM.

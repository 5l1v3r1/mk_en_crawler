TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu attended the regular Supreme Justice Council meeting Thursday (16 June), using the event to highlight the role of the courts in the elections process.
Voters go to the polls on 3 July.
Moisiu noted that under the electoral code, the courts have one main legal obligation -- to evaluate citizensâ requests for registration in the final voters' lists.
He called on all judicial officials to fulfil this legal obligation with transparency, responsibility and professionalism.
Also Thursday, the Albanian Coalition Against Corruption said the electronic and print media are generally presenting balanced coverage of the campaign, providing equal time for all parties.
Moisiu had made a point of encouraging that, in recent weeks.

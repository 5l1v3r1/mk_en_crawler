ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government on Wednesday (2 February) denied media reports that it has been in contact with retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's three most wanted indictees. 
Local newspapers reported that a government negotiator met the fugitive somewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to surrender. 
War crimes co-operation is key to EU accession talks, scheduled to begin mid-March.
In other news Wednesday, the Croatian Parliament opened a debate on an agreement allowing the United States to use military facilities on Croatian territory. 
According to local media reports, US troops would use Croatian installations and airspace for training purposes.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Wednesday (October 17th) that there have been several anonymous calls about war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic since the country announced a 1m-euro award for information leading to his arrest.
Ljajic acknowledged, however, that the information has not led to any breakthroughs.
After meeting with the EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Brussels, Ljajic indicated he thinks Serbia will initial a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU soon.
For his part, Rehn reiterated that the arrest of remaining war crimes fugitives is a precondition for the signing of the SAA.

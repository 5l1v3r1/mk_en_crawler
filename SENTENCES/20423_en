BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The international troika mediating negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina on the future of Kosovo will make concrete proposals regarding final status when the teams meet next week in Brussels. 
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman, Cristina Gallach, said on Monday (November 12th) that the three envoys from the US, the EU and Russia will propose new ideas to bridge the impasse. 
She also said that the international troika will switch from its "mediating" role to "more pro-active attitude". 
According to some local media, the troika is considering the scenario of the two Germanys in 1972 as a possible model. 
Negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina are scheduled to end on December 10th.
The Kosovo status issue was the main topic of discussion at a meeting Monday between Russian envoy Alexander Bozan-Khartschenko and Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis. 
She reiterated that Athens would support a solution that guarantees regional stability and conforms to European principles.

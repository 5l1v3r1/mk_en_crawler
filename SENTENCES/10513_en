SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, warned Republika Srpska (RS) that its continued reluctance to detain war crimes suspects could have "catastrophic" consequences for the entire country. 
He signalled that integration in NATO and the EU would be stalled as long as RS refuses to co-operate with the UN tribunal. 
Ashdown also warned that individuals would be held accountable for failing to implement provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord.
Ashdown's comments followed a meeting in Sarajevo with the chairman of the Council of Europe (CoE), Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen. 
From BiH, Petersen travelled to Belgrade, where he met with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
On Wednesday, Petersen visits Pristina.

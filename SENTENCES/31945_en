PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- As expected, Milo Djukanovic was officially appointed prime minister Tuesday (26 November) after accepting the mandate from Filip Vujanovic, the parliament speaker.
As speaker, Vujanovic is also serving as caretaker president of the republic until a new one is elected in December.
Djukanovic resigned as president Monday to assume the post of prime minister.
He is to present his cabinet shortly.

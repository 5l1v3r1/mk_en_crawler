ATHENS, Greece -- Police announced on Monday (December 20th) the arrests of eight Greeks and one French citizen in an operation against an international drug trafficking network.
Cocaine, cannabis, ecstasy pills, weapons and cash were seized.
The suspected leader of the group is a Greek national with Greek and Canadian citizenship.
He was arrested on Friday following a tip from the US-based Drug Enforcement Agency.
The alleged organiser and his accomplices were arrested in Athens and in the town of Astros, in southern Peloponnese.
Police say they smuggled the drugs into the country from Canada and sold them in Athens, in the northeast part of Peloponnese and on the island of Crete.

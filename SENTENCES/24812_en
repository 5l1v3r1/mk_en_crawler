PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two separate explosions shook the Serb and Albanian parts of the ethnically divided town of Kosovska Mitrovica on Friday (January 2nd). 
The blasts injured six firefighters and damaged cars and property, media reported. 
One bomb exploded near a cafe in Kosovska Mitrovica's Serb-dominated northern part, while the second explosion occurred after Serb youths set two Albanian shops on fire. 
Tensions rose last week after a Serb was stabbed in a street fight with Albanians on December 30th. 
KFOR peacekeepers and EULEX stepped up their presence in the area late Friday to restore order. 
On Saturday, President Fatmir Sejdiu condemned the violence.
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Friday that Kosovo has no future in the EU as an independent state but only as Serbia's province. 
Recent incidents in Kosovo confirm Serbia's belief in the ongoing violation of human rights there, primarily those of the non-Albanian population, Tadic said. 
He expects the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will support Serbia's rejection of the legality of Kosovo's independence declaration last February, he said.

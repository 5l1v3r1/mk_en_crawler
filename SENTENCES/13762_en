BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has vetoed and returned to parliament for revision the law on the status of locally elected officials. 
His office issued a statement Tuesday (21 March) saying Basescu finds certain clauses of the law -- which is generally aimed at ending the "political migration" of local officials from one party to another -- as either unconstitutional or vague.

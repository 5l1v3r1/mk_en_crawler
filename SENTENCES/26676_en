BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik reiterated on Tuesday (February 9th) that a draft law on referendums is not aimed at seceding from BiH or violating the 1995 Dayton Peace Accord. 
The debate in parliament grew heated with opposition parties insisting the measure should include provisions for mandatory referendums in specific cases, such as joining military pacts and amending the constitution. 
Bosniak lawmakers say the bill is an "anti-Dayton" act and walked out. 
The debate continues Wednesday.
The US Embassy in Sarajevo warned against challenging Dayton Peace Accord structures, including the powers of high representatives. 
Washington, it said, would consider any referendum that endangers stability, sovereignty or the territorial integrity of BiH as provocative.

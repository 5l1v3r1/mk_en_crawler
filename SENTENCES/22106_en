SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The inspectorate at the Supreme Judicial Council discovered very serious violations among magistrates regarding major corruption cases, it announced on Wednesday (September 17th). 
The inspectorate found irregularities, for example, in the investigation of a group of businessmen around Lyudmil Stoykov and Mario Nikolov, both donors of President Georgi Parvanov's campaign. 
Authorities are investigating the group for any SAPARD fraud, the basis for the European Commission's decision to suspend remaining payments under the programme.

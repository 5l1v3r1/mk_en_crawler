ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkey-EU Troika meeting opened in Ankara Monday (June 4th), with talks expected to focus on problems related to the Balkan state's membership negotiations with the Union.
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Portuguese Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Cravinho and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn are in attendance.
Discussions may also touch on warnings of a Turkish cross-border operation into northern Iraq -- a possibility which allegedly has raised concerns in Brussels.

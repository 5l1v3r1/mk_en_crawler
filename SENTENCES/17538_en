NEW YORK, United States -- Montenegro has launched a new demilitarisation initiative aimed at reducing its nearly 12,000 tonnes of heavy weaponry to 2,000 tonnes, the UN announced on its website Friday (July 27th). 
It also plans to reduce the number of its ammunition depots from ten to three. 
Under the first phase of the initiative, battle tanks used by the Yugoslav National Army during the conflicts of the 1990s will be melted into scrap. 
Montenegro's demilitarisation efforts are being sponsored jointly by the government, OSCE, and the UNDP.

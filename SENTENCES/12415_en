TIRANA, Albania -- The local electricity company announced on Tuesday (8 March) that it would spend 23.5m euros of its own funds to upgrade the country's grid.
The Albanian Electro-Energy Corp (KESH) said it has raised the money by improving customer billing procedures and suspending imports during the past three months.
Heavy rainfall and snow has filled dams across the country, enhancing the production of electricity.
In the past, Albania has been plagued by power shortages resulting from its heavy dependence on hydroelectric power stations and its obsolete transmission systems.

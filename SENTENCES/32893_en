BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO formally announced that it was extending its mission in Macedonia under a new name.
Operation Allied Harmony begins on 16 December, the day after the mandate of the current mission, Amber Fox, expires.
In a statement issued Friday (29 November), the alliance said the new mission will be "significantly smaller in numbers" than Amber Fox, which has been in place since September 2001.
An attempt by the new EU rapid reaction force to assume the duties failed, due to a longstanding dispute between Turkey and Greece over use of NATO's infrastructure.

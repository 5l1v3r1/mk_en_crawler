TIRANA, Albania -- The government welcomed a vote by the European Parliament (EP) on Thursday (October 7th) in favour of lifting the EU visa regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said that the decision is the result of significant reforms undertaken by the government, its commitment to fight crime and corruption, a series of successes such as NATO membership, and the elections held in 2009. 
President Bamir Topi described the decision as a historic one, opening the path to travel freely. 
Opposition leader Edi Rama also welcomed the move.

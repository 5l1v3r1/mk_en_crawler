PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Negotiations on determining the final status of Kosovo will start in two years, leading to a resolution in three to four years, according to UNMIK chief Michael Steiner. 
During a visit to Germany on Wednesday (13 November), he added that the type of status is still uncertain. 
But his spokesman, Simon Haselock, denied media speculation that Steiner's statement hinted at independence for Kosovo. 
That, he said, would be up to the UN Security Council.
In other news Wednesday, UNMIK police permanently handed over the police station in Gracanica to the Kosovo Police Service, the first such permanent handover of responsibility to a local police unit.

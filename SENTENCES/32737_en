ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament on Friday (13 December) adopted a new law that would grant minorities eight seats in parliament and would allow teaching in minority languages in the schools.
Serbs, who account for up to 4.5 per cent of the population and are the largest ethnic group apart from the Croats, would get up to three seats depending on their turnout in elections.
The new law also establishes the way minorities will be represented in local governments.
In other news, nearly ten years after it arrived, the UN monitoring mission in Prevlaka peninsula formally transferred control to Croatian authorities Sunday morning.
This marked Croatia's official re-establishment of full sovereignty over the 2.5 km zone at its southern border with Yugoslavia.

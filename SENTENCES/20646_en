ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's main opposition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), unveiled its election platform on Saturday (September 8th). 
Addressing around 3,500 party delegates, SDP leader Zoran Milanovic said the party aimed to win the fall elections "not to obtain power, but to change this country". 
He said the platform is based on three main reform tasks -- comprehensive judicial sector restructuring, elimination of corruption and guaranteeing equal access to healthcare services.
In his address to delegates, the party's candidate for prime minister, Ljubo Jurcic, said priority should be given to reducing debt, as well as increasing exports and employment.

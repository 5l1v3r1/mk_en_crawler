ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors announced Tuesday (November 27) that they have indicted a former Yugoslav Army officer on charges of war crimes despite his acquittal by the UN tribunal. 
Court officials say there is new evidence suggesting that Miroslav Radic ordered paramilitaries to commit war crimes in Vukovar when the city fell to Serb forces in November 1991. 
He was also charged with shooting a Croat prisoner of war in the head in front of children. 
In September, the UN war crimes tribunal acquitted Radic of similar charges stemming from the murder of 200 Croats in Vukovar, causing an uproar in Croatia.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A parliamentary session that was supposed to include a vote on the public prosecutor's proposal to launch legal proceedings against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea failed on Tuesday (June 24th) for lack of a quorum. 
Nastase faces charges of taking bribes and forging official documents in connection with acquiring his current home, worth an estimated 1.5m euros. 
Mitrea is suspected of having allowed a swap of valuable land in northern Bucharest for less valuable land, despite a lawsuit that was already in progress. 
Only 208 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session, fewer than the 220 required.

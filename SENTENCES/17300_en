ATHENS, Greece -- Labour Minister Savvas Tsitouridis resigned from his post on Friday (April 27th) at the request of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, after a scandal over state bonds threatened to undermine the conservative government's popularity.
The prime minister said he would not tolerate any actions that might undermine the public trust in his government.
The new labour minister is Vassilis Maginas.

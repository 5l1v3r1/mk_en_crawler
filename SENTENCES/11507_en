NOVI SAD, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Erhard Busek, says Serbia needs a new constitution to better regulate the decentralisation process.
During a visit to Vojovodina on Tuesday (19 April), Busek added that constitutional changes would enhance the decentralisation process, including the autonomous status and development of Vojvodina.
His comments followed talks with the head of the Vojvodina parliamentary panel for international co-operation, Nenad Canak.

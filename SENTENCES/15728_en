SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police have smashed a regional gang suspected of a series of kidnappings for ransom, according to local media reports Sunday (October 22nd).
Police sources say the action followed more than three years of investigation.
Special units and helicopters were used in the operation, which resulted in the release of one person from Kosovo, abducted in Macedonia earlier this month.
The gang was based in Skopje and allegedly operated in Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, the interior ministry announced on Friday that police have detained a Serb convicted of drug trafficking in 2002 and sought by Interpol since 2003.
The arrest followed a year's worth of surveillance conducted jointly by the Bulgarian and Serbian authorities.

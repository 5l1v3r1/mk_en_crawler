SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes chamber of BiH's State Court on Wednesday (September 19th) sentenced Bosnian Croat Kreso Lucic to six years in prison for his actions during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
The judge found Lucic guilty of the illegal arrest of six Bosnian Muslim civilians, as well as the torture of a number of Muslims detained in the Kresevo military police headquarters in June and July of 1993.
Earlier on Wednesday, BiH's State Investigation and Protection Agency confirmed it had detained war crimes suspect Suad Kapic near the town of Cazin.
Kapic is to be handed over to prosecutors in Sarajevo for questioning.
He is suspected of committing war crimes against Serbs during the Bosnian army's "Sana '95" military operation.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski has refused to sign the new law on parliament members and returned the draft to the legislature for revision, according to an announcement Friday (29 July). 
According to the president, the new law -- recently approved by parliament via an emergency procedure -- gives retiring deputies preferential treatment, compared to the rest of the public. 
Crvenkovski based his decision to reject the law on the additional financial means required to implement it, saying the funding was not co-ordinated with the government or the parliamentary finance and budget commission. 
By law, if the legislature passes the same version of the bill, the president is obliged to sign it.

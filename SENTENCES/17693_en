BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The election of a new president in Albania late last week shows consensus is possible there, Cristina Gallach, EU security chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman, said on Monday (July 23rd).
Gallach urged the opposition and the ruling coalition in Albania to co-operate in implementing the most important reforms.
As for President-elect Bamir Topi, Gallach said he would enjoy full EU support.
Topi is to be sworn into office Tuesday afternoon, a ceremony leaders of the Socialist-led opposition had been urged to boycott.
But there is some break in the ranks:
Socialist Movement for Integration head Ilir Meta and the leader of the Party of Social Democracy Paskal Milo say they will attend.

TIRANA, Albania -- An EU delegation visiting Tirana on Wednesday (5 November) opened the third round of talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. 
The main issue discussed during the first day was the Agreement on Readmission, concerning individuals without resident permits. 
The two sides agreed to postpone implementation until two years after the Agreement on Readmission itself takes effect. 
The meeting continues through Friday.

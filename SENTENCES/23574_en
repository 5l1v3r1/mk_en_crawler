ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament's foreign policy committee unanimously decided on Monday (July 27th) to propose that President Stipe Mesic remove Neven Jurica as head of the Croatian mission to the UN.
Jurica requested he be relieved of his duties for health reasons.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration tightened control over the UN mission's spending in late June after turning up irregularities.
Media speculated then that Jurica would be removed from his post for financial abuse to the tune of several hundred thousand euros.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court ruled Wednesday (22 January) that Recep Tayyip Erdogan cannot be considered chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) because he resigned from the party's founding board in October. 
The resignation came as a result of another court ruling making Erdogan ineligible to hold the post because of a 1998 conviction for promoting Islamist values. 
AKP's founding board is expected to meet Thursday to elect Erdogan as chairman once again. 
The move would be legal because parliament has already amended the constitution to make Erdogan eligible for election. 
He is expected to run in by-elections in the Siirt province on 9 March. 
If elected, he could replace Abdullah Gul as prime minister.

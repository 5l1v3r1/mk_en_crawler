STRASBOURG, France -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Thursday (June 28th) that she would likely remain in office until the end of the year. 
"My mandate ends at the end of September, but the UN secretary-general has asked me to stay for three more months," del Ponte told reporters during a visit to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France. 
The extension reportedly would allow the international community more time to find a successor.
In her speech to the Council of Europe's Parliament Assembly (PACE), del Ponte stressed that the CoE and the UN tribunal share the same goals: combating impunity and promoting reconciliation. 
She again urged all remaining war crimes fugitives to be brought to justice. 
PACE members adopted a resolution Thursday that harshly criticised some states of the former Yugoslavia for a "blatant lack of political will" to prosecute war criminals.

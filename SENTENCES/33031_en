SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Federation Customs Administration officers have been subject to repeated threats, according to customs chief Zelimir Rebac.
He told reporters Thursday (22 May) that as the institution succeeds in uncovering various types of fraud -- preventing losses of about 100m euros -- threats against customs officials and their families have surged.
He called on entity authorities to help guarantee the necessary protection for his staff.

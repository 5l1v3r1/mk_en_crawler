BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Monday (October 19th) that last week's positive progress report on Macedonia and the recommendation to start EU accession talks serve as recognition of reforms in the country and encouragement to resolve the name dispute with Greece. 
He urged Skopje and Athens to work harder to settle the row in the spirit of European solidarity, stressing the importance of good neighbourly relations.

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) will discuss Albania's application for EU candidate status this autumn, Integration Minister Majlinda Bregu said on Monday (September 21st). 
She added that there is no apparent tendency to block the process and that it is not necessarily linked to an EU progress report on aspiring countries, expected in early November.

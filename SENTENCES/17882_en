NEW YORK, United States -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was among the 14 nations elected by the UN General Assembly on Thursday (May 17th) to serve on the Geneva-based 47-member UN Human Rights Council. 
BiH was included in the group in a bid to dump Belarus, viewed as one of the world's most repressive states. 
Initially the Eastern European countries proposed Belarus and Slovenia for the two seats from its region, sparking heated protest by human rights groups. 
In subsequent voting, BiH got more votes than Belarus. 
The 13 other countries are Angola, Bolivia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Italy, Madagascar, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Qatar, Slovenia and South Africa.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has rejected Libyan demands for "blood money" to secure the release of five nurses held since 1999. 
The women were sentenced to death in 2004 on charges -- widely considered dubious -- of infecting nearly 400 children with HIV. 
Bulgaria, which denies any wrongdoing on the part of the nurses, has indicated that paying any money would suggest they were guilty. 
However, it has hinted it is open to offering some form of assistance to the children in an attempt to resolve the situation. 
Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin said he was ready to "assist in solving the humanitarian problem" but would not pay "blood money", according to the Associated Press.

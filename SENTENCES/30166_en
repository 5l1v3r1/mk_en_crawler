BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU is asking Albania to re-establish political dialogue and hold free and democratic local elections on May 8th as a condition for integration. 
This position was reiterated on Thursday (April 14th) by Miroslav Lajcak, EU managing director for Europe and Central Asia, during his report to the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. 
He called on the EP to continue supporting dialogue in Albania. 
"We have to continue with our pressure and they have to know that we are â¦ observing the elections," Lajcak said.
During the session, there was a heated exchange between Romanian EP member Victor Bostinaru and Albanian Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli. 
Bostinaru delivered an open letter to the public, describing the offence he took at a comment Topalli made to the Albanian parliament in February. 
Media reported that Topalli accused the opposition of having bribed European officials, including Bostinaru, to work against the visa liberalisation process for Albanians. 
On Thursday Bostinaru denied that and said he considers himself a friend of Albanians who wants to help countries that aspire to join the EU. 
He slammed Albanian politicians who try to discredit everyone who notes their mistakes.

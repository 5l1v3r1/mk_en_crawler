PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a visit Monday (7 June), EU security chief Javier Solana said that while he is pleased to see the rebuilding of Serb houses destroyed during the mid-March violence in Kosovo, he is not happy with the pace of reconstruction.
He called for more concentrated efforts to speed up the process, warning that the EU would intervene if the process is not completed by September.
During his meeting with top local authorities, he insisted on the need to include Serbs in the political process in the province and he criticised an attack Saturday that killed a Serb teenager.
"A society where kids of 16 years are killed is not a healthy society .
That society does not belong to Europe," he said.

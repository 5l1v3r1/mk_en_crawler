NEW YORK, United States -- The Appeals Court in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday (December 9th) that a former Bosnian diplomat cannot be extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Muhamed Sacirbey, a US citizen, served as BiH's ambassador to the UN from 1992 to 2000.
Bosnian authorities have accused him of embezzling at least $600,000 in government funds and have sought his extradition since 2002.
The US court, however, found that he was never charged.
Sacirbey denies any wrongdoing.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Two US F-16 fighter planes landed at Batajnica Military Airfield on Thursday (22 June).
The Serbian Defence Ministry said the visit is "part of the process of increasing military co-operation between Serbia and the United States".
This is the first time that US warplanes have landed at a Serbian military base.
The visit was agreed on during a meeting between Serbian defence officials and Deputy Commander of US forces in Europe General Charles Wald last March.

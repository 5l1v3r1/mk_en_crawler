Economic freedom has improved in most of the Southeast European (SEE) countries since last year, but governments need to make further reforms to address lingering problems such as corruption, according to a report released on Tuesday (January 15th). 
According to the 14th annual edition of the Index of Economic Freedom, issued by The Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, Cyprus is the freest economy among the SEE countries, while Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is the region's straggler.
The 2008 Index ranks 157 nations on the basis of ten factors: business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government size, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labour freedom.
On the basis of scores from 0 to 100, countries are placed in five categories. 
Only seven of the 157 countries scored 80 points or higher to make it into the group of "free" economies. 
For the 14th year in succession, Hong Kong (90.3) and Singapore (87.4) finished 1st and 2nd in the global rankings, making them the world's freest economies. 
They were followed by Ireland, Australia, the United States, New Zealand and Canada.
Another 23 nations, including 12 EU member states, were characterised as "mostly free" economies with scores ranging from 70 to 79.9 points. 
Cyprus (71.3) slipped two places since last year to rank 22nd. 
It was placed 11th among the 41 countries in Europe and its overall score is higher than the regional average.
Of the other SEE countries, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Turkey and Greece, fell in the 51-nation group of "moderately free" economies, with scores ranging between 60 and 69.9.
Improvements in six of the ten freedoms have allowed Albania, scoring 63.3, to jump to 56th place, up from 66th last year. 
It now ranks 27th among the 41 countries in the European region.
"Albania's economic freedom ranks above the world average, and its score has risen over the past few years, a noteworthy achievement in a region characterised by federal separatism and instability," the Index, edited by Kim Holmes, Edwin Feulner and Mary Anastasia O'Grady, noted. 
"If Albania maintains its impressively strong investment freedom while doing more to combat corruption, its score should continue to rise."
Bulgaria is ranked 59th with a score of 62.9, and moved up three places from last year, primarily because of improved trade freedom. 
The country, which joined the EU along with Romania in January 2007, is now the 28th freest economy among the 41 European nations and its overall score is slightly above the world average, according to the report.
Bulgaria scores highly in six freedoms, including trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and labour freedom. 
But Bulgaria is significantly below the world average in freedom from corruption and property rights.
Those two areas appear to be the weakest also for Albania, BiH, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania.
Romania is ranked 68th with an overall score of 61.5. 
This is a 0.3 percentage point increase over last year, reflecting improved scores in monetary freedom and the investment climate. 
The country is the 30th freest economy in the European region, and its overall score is below the regional average.
With a score of 61.1, Macedonia is ranked 71st in the world and 31st in Europe. 
Of the other SEE countries in the group of "moderately free" economies, Turkey (60.8) and Greece (60.1) are ranked as the world's 74th and 80th freest economies, respectively.
Of all SEE countries, only Croatia and BiH fell in the 52-nation group of "mostly unfree" economies, made up of countries that earned average scores of between 50 and 59.9 points.
Serbia and Montenegro are not included in the 2008 Index due to a lack of reliable data.

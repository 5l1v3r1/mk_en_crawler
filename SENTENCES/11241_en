ATHENS, Greece -- According to poll results released by the RASS agency Friday (24 December), a majority of Greeks approve of their country's role at the European Council summit, which decided to start accession talks with neighbouring Turkey.
A total of 42.7 per cent of respondents thought the government had done the best it could to support Greek and Cypriot interests.
In addition, 68 per cent said Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos was right not to veto accession talks with Ankara.
The EC's decision was conditional on Turkey pledging to sign a customs agreement with Cyprus.

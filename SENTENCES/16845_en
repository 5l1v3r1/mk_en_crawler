BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic met with Macedonian counterpart President Branko Crvenkovski in Belgrade on Wednesday (5 April), agreeing there is no need to craft a new agreement on the interstate border.
According to Crvenkovski, he and his host reaffirmed that the border demarcation issue between Macedonia and Serbia was defined under the 2001 agreement, sealed by Skopje and Belgrade and recognised by the UN, and must not be re-opened.
As for Kosovo, Crvenkovski said the demarcation of the common border between Macedonia and the province is a technical operation that must involve Skopje, Belgrade, Pristina and UNMIK.

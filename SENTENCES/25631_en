NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot Archbishop Chrysostomos II arrived in the Turkish dominated northern part of Cyprus on Monday (March 22nd), the first such visit since 1974, when the island was separated into Turkish-dominated north and Greek-dominated south.
Chrysostomos II is trying to gain support for the restoration of an ancient monastery, the Apostolos Andreas, which he wants to begin soon after Easter (April 4th).
In other news Monday, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias announced that he and members of the government have agreed to voluntarily cut their wages by 10%.
Christofias expressed hope that others will follow the government's example.

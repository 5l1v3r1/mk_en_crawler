TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha is urging Balkan countries to create their own Schengen zone for the free movement of citizens. 
Speaking at an ambassadors' conference in Tirana on Tuesday (October 28th), Basha called on diplomatic envoys in the region to work in this direction. 
He said all Balkan states should follow the example of Albania and Macedonia, which opened their borders earlier this year.

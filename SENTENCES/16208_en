TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu again urged the main political parties Tuesday (16 May) to immediately begin concrete efforts to implement electoral reform. 
Moisiu sent letters to leaders of the 12 formations that sealed the political accords for the reform last December, warning that continued delays might jeopardise Albania's Euro-Atlantic integration process.

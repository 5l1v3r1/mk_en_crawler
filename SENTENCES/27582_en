BUCHAREST, Romania -- Lawmakers on Wednesday (October 27th) will debate and vote on a no-confidence motion against the government, which is accused of failing to deal with the economic crisis.
The main labour unions, meanwhile, plan a protest in front of the government building and a march to Constitution Square, which is expected to attract over 80,000 participants.
The opposition has 213 members in parliament and the motion needs 236 votes to pass.
The government's chances of survival improved sharply on Monday, when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner -- the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians -- announced they would abstain from the vote.

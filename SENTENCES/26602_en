BUCHAREST, Romania -- IMF experts are negotiating with the cabinet to lay off up to 150,000 public sector employees over the course of the next year, local media reported on Monday (August 10th), quoting government sources. 
This would translate into savings of about 0.35% of GDP. 
Talks are also reportedly under way about freezing pensions and wages until 2011. 
The IMF also suggests suspending a planned 2% increase in pensions this autumn and wants to see all civil servants take unpaid leave for two to three weeks, starting next month.
Currently, as many as 1.4 million people work in Romania's public sector. 
President Traian Basescu recently told national public radio that there are too many public sector employees and the cabinet must start restructuring these jobs as soon as possible.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 60 people were arrested during an anti-government rally attended by about 15,000 people in Zagreb on Saturday (February 26th). 
In all 25 people, -- 12 of them police officers -- were injured in clashes that erupted when dozens of youth tried to reach the central square, where the government is headquartered. 
Pelted by rocks and sticks, police responded with tear gas. 
The rally came only a few days after another anti-government protest organised via Facebook ended in clashes.
Elsewhere in Zagreb, thousands joined a peaceful protest in support of war veterans, particularly a Croat awaiting extradition to Serbia in a Bosnian prison. 
Tihomir Purda, who fought in Vukovar, was detained in January at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. 
A similar protest was held in Osijek.

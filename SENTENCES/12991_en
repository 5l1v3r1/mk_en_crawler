BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The influence of Slobodan Milosevic is on the rise again in Serbian institutions, the London-based Independent reported on Tuesday (1 March), citing rulings by the Serbian Supreme Court that favoured the ex-dictator. 
Judges recently overturned a lower court's decision to confiscate a home that Milosevic acquired illegally, while also dropping cases against his wife and son. 
According to the British paper, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's attacks on independent media as "unpatriotic" and "paid by the West" also suggest a return to the past.
In parliament, meanwhile, the Socialists and ultranationalist Radicals are pushing for a resolution decrying alleged "violations" of Milosevic's rights. 
On Monday, however, lawmakers rejected a draft resolution that urged support for his defence before The Hague tribunal.

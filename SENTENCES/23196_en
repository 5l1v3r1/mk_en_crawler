PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the EU judicial and police mission in Kosovo (EULEX) said on Monday (March 31st) that the mission would be deployed throughout Kosovo, including in the Serb-dominated north, although it will take some time until everything is fully functioning. 
"We are in the preparation phase, but our goal is to deploy the mission in the entire territory," Yves de Kermabon said. 
"For me, Kosovo has only one police force and that is the Kosovo Police Service (KPS). 
I am happy that there are many Serb members of the KPS who are still working in northern Kosovo."
Also on Monday, the Spanish Foreign Ministry announced Madrid would not participate in EULEX until the transfer of responsibilities from UNMIK to EULEX is legally approved. 
Spain is among the EU member states that have still not recognised Kosovo.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic, who heads the opposition Democratic Party (DS), announced on Sunday (12 December) that the DS has kicked off a campaign for early elections in Serbia. 
Addressing a party congress in Belgrade, Tadic declared that the need for early elections was obvious, given the public's dissatisfaction with the work of current authorities. 
He again criticised the incumbent government for lack of courage in implementing reforms. 
In a separate statement Sunday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica insisted his government would remain in power until the spring of 2005.

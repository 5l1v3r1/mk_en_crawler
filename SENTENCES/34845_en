ZAGREB, Croatia -- A mild earthquake struck southern Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia early Sunday (3 August).
Minor property damage was reported in Metkovic, Dubrovnik and the Peljesac peninsula in Croatia.
Authorities announced several weaker quakes on Saturday that did no damage.
In other news, a new forest fire was reported near the coastal town of Zadar just as firefighters had brought fires on the islands of Hvar and Brac under control.
About 500 firefighters with 48 vehicles and four planes have battled the wind-driven fires for nearly four days.
The latest blaze threatens vast oak forests in central Dalmatia.

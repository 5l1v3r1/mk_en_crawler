ANKARA, Turkey -- Police defused an explosive device placed under a minivan in downtown Ankara on Tuesday (September 11th), averting what could have been a massive blast on the sixth anniversary of terror attacks in the United States. 
The vehicle was parked in a multi-story parking garage in a densely populated area of the city. 
Governor Kemal Onal said the large quantity of explosives discovered by sniffer dogs could have caused extensive damage and casualties.

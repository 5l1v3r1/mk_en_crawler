SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In a speech to parliament late Thursday (April 10th), President Branko Crvenkovski asked lawmakers to abandon a plan to hold early elections, insisting such a step would only slow Macedonia's NATO and EU integration.
"There will always be time for elections, but there is no time anymore for missed chances," Crvenkovski said.
"Without a compromise with Greece over the name issue, there will be no NATO;
there will not be accession talks with the EU," the president warned.
Parliament began debating its possible early dissolution after NATO rejected Macedonia's bid for membership last week.
The next scheduled elections aren't until 2010.

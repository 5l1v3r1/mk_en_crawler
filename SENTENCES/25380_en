SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH has charged a group of Bosnian Muslims with terrorism and illegal weapons trafficking, the court announced on Tuesday (December 22nd). 
According to the indictment, radical Muslim Rijad Rustempasic organised the group to carry out attacks aimed at destabilising the country. 
He and two others -- Abdulah Handzic and Edis Velic -- were arrested in November. 
As part of the same indictment, the court charged Rustempasic's brother, Muhamed, and another man, Edis Strol, with arms trafficking. 
According to local media reports, the group allegedly planned to bomb Sarajevo's Catholic cathedral, a monastery in the town of Fojnica, and attack NATO troops in BiH. 
Media reports suggest all those charged were members of the fundamentalist Wahabbi branch of Islam.
In other news Tuesday, police arrested two Bosniaks suspected of committing war crimes against Serb civilians during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
Almir Padalovic, 41, and Pedzo Balic, 57, were detained in Konjic.

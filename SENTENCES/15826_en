NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus asked the EU on Thursday (20 July) for assistance in dealing with the influx of evacuees from Lebanon, saying that the island is starting to buckle under the pressure.
The appeal came after an urgent session of the Greek Cypriot cabinet on the issue.
Government official Makis Constantinides said Cyprus is currently the only outlet for foreigners leaving Lebanon.
He called on other EU member states to open their harbours and airports and join the efforts.
According to the government in Nicosia, approximately 12,000 people have come through the island since the beginning of this week.
Authorities say the number could rise to 70,000.

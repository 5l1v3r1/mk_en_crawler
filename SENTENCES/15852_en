ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday (November 20th) ruled out the possibility of early parliamentary elections, stressing that the scheduled vote is in November 2007. 
According to Erdogan, early elections would have a negative impact on many areas, including the economy. 
He was responding to recent statements by the opposition Republican People's Party and Nationalist Movement Party.
Also Monday, riot police had to intervene after left-wing protestors occupied the Ankara bureau of the Associated Press news agency. 
Police used tear gas to remove the 20 leftist activists, who were demanding better treatment of prisoners in Turkey. 
No one was hurt.

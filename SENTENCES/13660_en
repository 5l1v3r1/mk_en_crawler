BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the BiH State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA), Sredoje Novic, says the thorough examination of possible terrorist activities in the country must be a priority this year.
In Sunday's (22 January) edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, Novic said that a major task for SIPA and other relevant state bodies in BiH should be to establish the level of radicalisation within certain circles and determine whether they are heading towards terrorism.
He said BiH institutions must boost co-operation, adding that SIPA plans talks with the Intelligence and Security Agency aimed at a joint takeover of responsibility for anti-terror activities.

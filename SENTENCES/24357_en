ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors submitted a second indictment in the controversial Ergenekon case to an Istanbul court Tuesday (March 10th), media reported.
The new indictment charged 56 more people in connection with an alleged plot to topple the ruling Justice and Development Party's government.
Local media reported two retired generals, Sener Eruygur and Hursit Tolon, are among the indictees.
Police arrested them last year but released them because of poor health.
The new indictment includes charges of attempting to overthrow the government, inciting an armed uprising and possessing explosives and secret state documents.
It also claims the suspects had links to outlawed groups such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Hezbollah in the 1980s.
The second indictment means 133 people now stand accused of belonging to the Ergenekon group.
The trial of the first 86 indictees began in October.
In other news Tuesday, three PKK members surrendered to Turkish security forces in the town of Silopi, in southeastern Sirnak province, media reported.
The three had escaped from PKK training camps in northern Iraq.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Thursday (2 January) a series of measures aimed at increasing the size of its professional army.
A total of 25,000 military personnel will be hired by 2005, bringing the overall number of professional soldiers to 50 per cent of the total army.
Furthermore, the government intends to reduce the length of compulsory military service, making it 12 months in the Army, 14 months in the Navy and 15 months in the Air Force.
Athens will also review its military priorities, with an eye to improving the Army's efficiency and modernising it in line with increased terrorist threats to global security.

ANKARA, Turkey -- On Wednesday (6 August), Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approved a law that would curb the powers of the military by enhancing the consultative character of the country's National Defence Council. 
The 7th EU legal harmonisation package also provides for civilian oversight of military spending. 
The EU insisted on the adoption of the measure as a condition for the opening of accession talks at the end of 2004.
In other news, two police officers were killed and one was injured during an attack on a checkpoint in the town of Mardin in southeastern Turkey.

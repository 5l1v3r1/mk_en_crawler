SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Experts from NATO member states' special services will arrive this week to help Bulgaria introduce alliance standards in the field of security. 
Their visit is not related to the recent wiretapping scandal involving the National Security Service, according to Deputy Interior Minister Boiko Kotsev. 
Speaking Sunday (5 January) on Bulgarian national radio, Kotsev acknowledged however that classified information leaks are a major weakness that must be addressed.
Later this week, a Bulgarian delegation will travel to Brussels to attend the first round of official talks on opening negotiations for Bulgarian accession to the alliance. 
The second round will be held a month later.
Meanwhile, Bulgaria has launched an investigation into the arms trader Kintex, following a US newspaper report linking the company to illegal arms imports to the United States. 
But officials insist the 2000 deal involving AK-47 assault rifles was legal.

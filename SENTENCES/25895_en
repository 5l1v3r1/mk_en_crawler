SOFIA, Bulgaria -- About 3,000 police officers staged a peaceful protest in Sofia on Saturday (March 20th) against planned salary cuts.
To curb spending, the government wants to force police and others to make their own contributions to social security, effectively reducing wages by just over 12%.
The protestors, who wore civilian clothes rather than their uniforms, also demanded better working conditions and judicial reforms.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer on Thursday (15 January) called on Bosnian Serb authorities to arrest war crimes suspects who remain at large, saying they must do so "before their country can cross the threshold into Europe". 
De Hoop Scheffer told journalists after meetings with top international official Paddy Ashdown and SFOR Commander General Virgil Packett that NATO would remain committed to BiH until the EU takes over the mission later this year. 
The fact that BiH was the first state he visited since assuming his post underscores the Alliance's commitment to BiH, he said. 
De Hoop Scheffer added that the situation in the country has improved significantly and urged officials to continue along the path to membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
He visits Kosovo on Friday to meet with local interim officials, as well as senior representatives of KFOR and UNMIK.
Also Thursday, the EU Police Mission in BiH announced that its chief priority this year is the same as in 2003 -- increased co-operation among the BiH police forces, with an eye to restructuring and strengthening the security sector.

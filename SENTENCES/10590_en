SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Hari Kostov tendered his resignation Monday (15 November) to Parliamentary Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski. 
Kostov said he is leaving because of disagreements with minor government ally -- the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI). 
He said there is lack of consent and team work in government, which blocks implementation of Ohrid Peace Accord. 
Kostov also accused DUI of working for its own nationalistic and inter-party interests but not for the interest of the country. 
Kostov's resignation needs approval in parliament; if it is accepted, President Branko Crvenkovski could name a new prime minister without calling early elections.
In other news, the trial of four men charged in the so-called Rastanski Lozja case is scheduled to begin in Skopje. 
Former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski is charged with having ordered the 2002 murders of seven immigrants branded as terrorists, in an alleged attempt to impress the international community. 
Boskovski is standing trial separately in Croatia, where he holds dual citizenship.

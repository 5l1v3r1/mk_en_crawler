ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with visiting Iraqi President Jalal Talabani on Saturday (March 8th). 
At a press conference afterwards, both agreed on the need to combat terrorism. 
"The fight against global terrorism tops the agenda of the world ... 
Turkey's fight against the banned Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) should be assessed in this respect," Erdogan said. 
On Friday, Talabani met with his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul. 
The Turkish president called on PKK terrorists to put down their weapons, and described the group as a problem both for Turkey and Iraq. 
Talabani, meanwhile, said the autonomous government of northern Iraq is trying to convince the PKK to stop its attacks against Turkey.

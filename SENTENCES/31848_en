ANKARA, Turkey -- US Ambassador to Turkey Robert Pearson said Washington would provide between $4 billion and $15 billion in economic aid to Ankara in the event of a military operation in neighbouring Iraq. 
Speaking Thursday (2 January), Pearson did not explicitly condition the aid package on Turkish support for such an operation, but sought to reassure Turkey that its economy would be able to withstand the pressures that could result. 
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, meanwhile, begins a diplomatic tour of the Middle East on Saturday, trying to gauge consensus there.

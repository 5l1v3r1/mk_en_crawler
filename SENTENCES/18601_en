MUNICH, Germany -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Saturday (February 10th) that he would like to see Kosovo with stable institutions in 2008 and solid ties to Serbia. 
He also said he hopes to see Serbia as a NATO member within a couple of years. 
He was speaking at a security conference in Munich, attended by state leaders, defence and foreign ministers, parliament members and experts from more than 50 states. 
At the forum, de Hoop Scheffer called on NATO member states to agree on a new strategic concept by 2009, urging it to boost co-operation with the UN, the EU and other partners in stabilising the Middle East and elsewhere.

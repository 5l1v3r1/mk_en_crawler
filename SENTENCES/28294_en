BUCHAREST, Romania -- A court in Bucharest on Friday (June 18th) sentenced a Romanian and a Bulgarian to 12.5 years in prison each for passing classified information to Ukraine. 
Floricel Achim and Petar Marinov Zikolov were arrested in March 2009 in Bucharest on charges of having delivered confidential Romanian military files to a country that is not a member of NATO. 
According to the prosecution, between 2002 and 2008, Achim gave Zikolov "documents that might have threatened the security of Romania". 
Zikolov passed the documents to Ukrainian officials. 
Achim admitted to the charges saying he did it because he was in a grave financial situation.

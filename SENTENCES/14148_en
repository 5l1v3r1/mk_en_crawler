ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis shuffled his New Democracy (ND) cabinet on Tuesday (14 February), the first such changes since the party took power two years ago.
One of the major replacements was at the foreign ministry, where Dora Bakoyianni -- currently mayor of Athens -- succeeded Petros Molyviatis.
She becomes the first woman in Greece to hold the post.
Three ministers retained their seats -- Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis, Development Minister Dimitris Sioufas and Education Minister Marietta Giannakou.
Karamanlis leaves on Wednesday for visits to Germany and Ireland.

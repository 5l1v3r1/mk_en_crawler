ZAGREB, Croatia -- Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, in Zagreb for talks with his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Sanader, voiced support Saturday (18 March) for enlarging the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) to include other Balkan countries and Moldova.
"In close co-operation with Croatia, we wish to make more dynamic and modernise this agreement, and attract regional participation to the largest possible extent," Tariceanu told journalists.
As holder of the rotating CEFTA chairmanship, Bucharest will hold a regional meeting next month on establishing a free trade zone based on CEFTA principles and in line with the process of EU integration, Tariceanu said.
CEFTA, which formerly included ten countries that joined the EU in 2004, now consists of Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania.
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro, Moldova as well the UN-administered province of Kosovo have been invited to attend the meeting in Bucharest.

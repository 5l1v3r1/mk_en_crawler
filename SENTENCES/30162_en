SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) ambassadors will meet on Friday (April 15th) to discuss this week's decision by Republika Srpska's (RS) Parliament to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office.
The US Embassy in Sarajevo issued a statement Thursday saying that Washington denounces all activities that question the legitimacy of state judicial institutions established under the Dayton Peace Accords.
The Bosnian Serb parliament decided on Wednesday to call a referendum but set no date for it.
RS President Milorad Dodik insists that BiH's Court and Prosecutor's Office are biased regarding war crime cases involving Serbs, leading to inter-ethnic hatred and intolerance.

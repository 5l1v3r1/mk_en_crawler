TIRANA, Albania -- Sources close to the government were quoted as saying on Sunday (May 16th) that Albania will raise its level of representation at the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC). 
Until now, it has been at the deputy-minister level, a move seen by the critics as a government attempt to ingratiate itself with Europe and the United States, rather than with Islamic countries. 
This week, however, Foreign Minister Ilir Meta himself is expected to attend the OIC session in Dushanbe.

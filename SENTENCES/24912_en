SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Twelve people, including a police officer, have been arrested for alleged involvement in an international network for illegal immigration to Western Europe, police spokesman Ivo Kotevski announced on Wednesday (July 1st).
The arrests were made in a joint operation involving police in Macedonia and Serbia.
From November to May, organisers allegedly moved 35 Chinese immigrants to Western Europe via Serbia, Macedonia and Greece.
The immigrants arrived at Belgrade's airport, then were driven to the border between Serbia and Macedonia and continued on to Greece.
Kotevski explained that the criminal group includes Macedonian, Serbian, Chinese and Greek nationals.

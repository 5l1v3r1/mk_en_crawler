PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic survived a no-confidence vote Tuesday (November 30th), 44-28.
The opposition Movement for Changes and New Serbian Democracy accuse Krivokapic of exceeding his powers, violating the constitution and of excluding bills proposed by the opposition from parliament's agenda.
Also on Tuesday, parliament refused to discuss a New Serbian Democracy initiative to establish a parliamentary panel to monitor the fight against corruption and organised crime.

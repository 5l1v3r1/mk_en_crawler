TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Monday (March 22nd) that by removing existing visa barriers, Albania will be brought closer to the EU. 
Albania is undertaking a series of reforms, especially in its justice system, Topi said after meeting in Tirana with Eduard Kukan, head of the European Parliament (EP) delegation for South Eastern Europe. 
The two main political parties will overcome their stalemate and ensure Albanians a European future, he added. 
Kukan said the EP welcomes Topi's role as mediator.
In other news Monday, the head of OSCE office in Tirana, Robert Bosch, said that a commission created in parliament to investigate elections is useless because it does not have consensus from all sides. 
Parliament approved the establishment of the panel in the absence of the opposition.

ATHENS, Greece -- Heavy rains flooded large areas of northeastern Greece this weekend, forcing the government to declare a state of emergency Sunday (November 18th) in the Rodopi prefecture. 
Residents of several villages were forced to flee their homes there and in the town of Komotini. 
The army sent trucks to help with the evacuations. 
Roads and bridges were damaged. 
Floods also hit the Peloponnese peninsula, which was devastated by summer wildfires. 
One death was blamed on the flooding. 
Minor flooding also was reported in neighbouring Bulgaria.

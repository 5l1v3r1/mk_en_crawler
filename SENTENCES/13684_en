BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview published Sunday (20 November), Croatian President Stipe Mesic said that creating a third entity in BiH would not be a good idea. 
Rejecting the proposal recently voiced by some Croatian nationalist circles in BiH, Mesic said that a third Bosnian entity would "conserve" irreversibly the situation in the neighbouring state. 
Mesic, whose country was one of the signatories of the Dayton Peace Accords for BiH in 1995, welcomed the 10th anniversary of the agreement that put an end to the bloody interethnic conflict. 
He noted, however, the process would not be complete until efficient state mechanisms are established in BiH.

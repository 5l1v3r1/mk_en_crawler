BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU approved its planned 1,800-member civil mission in Kosovo on Saturday (February 16th). 
The mission, dubbed Eulex, will replace the present UNMIK. 
It will have an initial mandate of two years and will be charged with guiding and counselling the Kosovo institutions in all fields related to establishing an independent and multiethnic judiciary and a multiethnic police force.
Peter Feith was officially appointed the EU's special representative in Kosovo and former KFOR commander French Lieutenant Yves de Kermabon will head the mission. 
The first representatives are expected to arrive in Kosovo within a week or two to prepare the deployment of the entire mission within four months.
Meanwhile, Serbia officially protested against the EU mission on Saturday to Slovenian Ambassador to Belgrade Miroslav Luci, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency. 
The document says the decision, if made outside the UN Security Council, is illegal.

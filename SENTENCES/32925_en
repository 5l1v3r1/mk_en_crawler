ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Sunday (29 June) that the next parliamentary elections would likely take place in November.
Though some within the ruling Social Democrats were advocating a date next year, Racan said he saw "no reason" for a delay past November.
Authorities must complete and submit an EU membership questionnaire prior to the vote, he added.
The government hopes to receive it by 10 July, and to submit it by 1 October.
Croatia is seeking to obtain official EU candidate status in April 2004 and to join the Union in 2007.

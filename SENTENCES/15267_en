PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegro and the European Commission (EC) resumed technical negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) in Podgorica on Tuesday (26 September). 
This was the first round of SAA talks held since Montenegro split from the former federal union with Serbia. 
According to Reinhard Priebe, director of the EC Western Balkans department, it is still too early to say when the SAA negotiations could be completed.

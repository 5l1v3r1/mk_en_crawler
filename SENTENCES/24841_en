BELGRADE, Serbia -- Democratic Party member Oliver Dulic said on Monday (March 2nd) that Belgrade would investigate a report published in Sunday's Los Angeles Times, which alleges former State Security chief Jovica Stanisic worked for the CIA.
Stanisic, once considered one of Slobodan Milosevic's closest allies, headed Serbia's special services between 1992 and 2000.
According to the report, he started providing confidential information to the CIA in 1992 when he met with CIA officer William Lofgren in Belgrade's Topcider Park.
The Times described Stanisic as the CIA's main person in Belgrade for years, reporting that, in turn, the CIA sent a confidential document to The Hague war crimes tribunal explaining the assistance he provided to the agency.
Hague prosecutors have charged Stanisic with crimes against humanity.

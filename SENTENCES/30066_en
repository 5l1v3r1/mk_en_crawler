VIENNA, Austria -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader testified before an Austrian parliamentary commission Wednesday (December 23rd) and denied any wrongdoing in connection with Austria's Hypo Bank.
The former leader spoke via video link from a jail in Salzburg.
A committee of regional lawmakers from the province of Carinthia is investigating the near-collapse of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank, which racked up losses from bad loans in Eastern Europe and had to be nationalised last year.
Sanader told the committee his "conscience is clean" and said he did not receive any commissions from the bank or its clients.
Some media reports have speculated that Sanader got a large commission from the Austrian bank for helping it launch operations in Croatia and may have received thousands of euros from Croatian firms to ensure they got loans.

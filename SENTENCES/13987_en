ANKARA, Turkey -- The British Embassy in Ankara issued a statement Tuesday (16 August) welcoming the recent arrest of a suspected al-Qaeda member, Luay Sakka, in Diyarbakir, Turkey. 
Sakka, a Syrian national, is suspected of planning and financing the 2003 string of bombings in Istanbul that targeted the HSBC Bank, the British Consulate-General, and two synagogues. 
The embassy statement praised the professionalism of the Turkish police and said their commitment contributed to the global fight against terrorism. 
Sakka, referred to in Turkish media as Sakra, was detained in Diyarbakir on 6 August and appeared before a Turkish court late last week.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele says Serbia has the capacity to progress quickly in the EU integration process.
In an interview with Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti on Saturday (February 19th), he said that an independent judiciary, effective implementation of laws, and meeting political criteria are essential preconditions for EU candidate status and that Serbia can expect an answer in October.
As for organ trafficking allegations, Fuele urged Council of Europe rapporteur Dick Marty to provide any evidence he has to EULEX prosecutors.

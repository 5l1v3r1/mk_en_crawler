BELGRADE, Serbia -- Central Bank Governor Radovan Jelasic cautioned on Wednesday (April 18th) that Serbia risks losing four World Bank loans totalling 280m euros, due to the impasse over forming a new government. 
Elections were held in January, but so far no new cabinet has been established. 
Jelasic's warning followed the joint IMF-World Bank spring meetings held late last week. 
He stressed that if Serbia does not get a new cabinet by the constitutional deadline of May 15th, the Bank would, in essence, have no partner with which to sign credit arrangements.

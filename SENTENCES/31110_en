BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade postponed the trial against the wife of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic on Friday (December 3rd) until April 5th, due to procedural issues. 
Bosiljka Mladic is accused of illegal possession of an automatic gun, a hunting rifle and several pistols, which were allegedly seized during a December 2008 raid of the family home in Belgrade. 
About two dozen ultranationalists attended Friday's hearing, holding banners in support of Ratko Mladic, protesting what they described as the "torture" of his family. 
Relatives insist the fugitive is dead -- a claim that the government has refused to accept.

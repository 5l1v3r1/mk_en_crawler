THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister and KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj was a gangster in uniform responsible for dozens of murders, Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said in her opening statement in the trial of the most senior Kosovo official to have been charged with war crimes. 
She rejected defence attorney claims that Haradinaj fought an "honourable war", targeting fighters, not civilians. 
"The prosecution will prove that these men â¦ have blood on their hands", she said at the start of the trial Monday (March 5th). 
According to the indictment, the three were part of a joint criminal conspiracy to drive Serbs and others out of territory held by the KLA.

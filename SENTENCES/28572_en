BELGRADE, Serbia -- The remains of at least 11 people have been found in the partially drained Perucac Lake near Bajina Basta, the war crimes prosecutor's office announced on Tuesday (September 14th).
Authorities believe the victims were killed by Bosnian Serb Milan Lukic and his paramilitary group.
In July 2009, the UN war crimes tribunal sentenced Lukic to life in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslim civilians in the town of Visegrad, from 1992 to 1994.
The Perucac, a reservoir on the Drina River, marks the border between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

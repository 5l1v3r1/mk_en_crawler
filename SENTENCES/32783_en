TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano declared Monday (9 December) that Albania and Yugoslavia should be pioneers in creating a climate of co-operation in the Balkans.
His remarks were directed at visiting Yugoslav Minister of Health Milos Knezevic.
Nano began with joint efforts on health related matters but said co-operation should be expanded more broadly, adding that in small countries such as his, the road to development is through co-operation.
In other news, the Yugoslav airline JAT is scheduled to resume flights to Tirana next week, for the first time in more than 20 years.
Officials say there will be three flights a week between the two capitals.

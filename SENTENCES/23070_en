BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu urged the international community Wednesday (April 2nd) to abandon "Cold War" thinking and to unite against common challenges. 
"We should accept the fact that all of us, the former communist countries, but probably Russia most of all, should abandon Cold War logic because at the current moment, nothing justifies it," Basescu told a joint press conference held with US President George W. 
Bush. 
For his part, Bush praised Basescu's leadership and position in the region and thanked Romania for its NATO membership and contribution to peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Also Wednesday, Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu met with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is in Bucharest for the NATO summit. 
They discussed the establishment of a regional centre for UN peacekeeping operations. 
Ban praised Romania's contributions to UN missions, including the one in Kosovo.

TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) leader Ilir Meta accused lawmakers on Monday (May 5th) of having lost their freedom after he failed to collect the 28 signatures in parliament needed to submit to the country's Constitutional Court as a request for a national referendum on constitutional changes.
Meta now plans to use another article of the constitution that will allow him to initiate a referendum procedure if he gets 50,000 citizen signatures.
The petition drive will begin on Saturday, when a protest in Tirana's main square will also be held.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said Sunday (30 November) the government expects the EU summit in December to confirm the country's accession timetable. 
This means that the EU should approve setting 2004 as the year for completion of accession talks, 2005 as the year for signing the accession treaty, and 2007 as the target year for Bulgaria's entry into the Union. 
Passy is in Maastricht to attend the two-day OSCE Ministerial Council meeting, which starts Monday. 
Bulgaria assumes the OSCE chairmanship-in-office in 2004.

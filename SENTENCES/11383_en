PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK Chief Soren Jessen-Petersen issued a decision Friday (22 July) on launching pilot projects for decentralisation in Kosovo, his office said.
The projects will begin at five newly-established units of local government:
Gracanica (near Pristina), General Jankovic (near Kacanik), Junik (near Decani), Mamusa (near Prizren) and Partes (near Gnjilane).
According to UNMIK, the initiative will be a major test for the Kosovo government and for provisional institutions of self-government.
Later on Friday, the OSCE Mission in Kosovo welcomed Jessen-Petersen's move, saying it was a step toward bringing government closer to the people.
The OSCE Mission also called for a swift appointment of municipal councils as well as definition of the competencies of the new municipal units.

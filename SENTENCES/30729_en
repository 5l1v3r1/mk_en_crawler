ATHENS, Greece -- Experts from the European Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF ended a review of Greece's progress in implementing austerity measures on Friday (February 11th), praising reforms that have been undertaken, but urging further efforts to "build a critical mass necessary to secure fiscal sustainability and economic recovery".
The experts were on their third mission to the country prior to releasing the fourth 15b-euro tranche of the 110b-euro bailout loan Greece received last May.
The mission said authorities in Athens should sell 50 billion euros' worth of state assets, including public property, to generate more funds for the economy.
Athens, however, reacted sharply to the suggestion.
"We are not willing to negotiate the limits of our self-respect with anyone.
We only accept orders from the Greek people," government spokesperson Giorgos Petalotis said Saturday.
Separately, the state railway OSE announced on Friday it is stopping its international lines as part of cost-cutting measures.
Ticket prices will also be increased.
OSE has debts of almost 10 billion euros.

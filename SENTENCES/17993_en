BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu urged the public to stay calm Tuesday (July 17th), following a train derailment in neighbouring Ukraine that unleashed a toxic cloud of yellow phosphorus late Monday.
The cabinet held an urgent meeting and was assured that it would take 36 to 48 hours for the cloud to reach Romania.
Authorities are monitoring the situation and are in touch with counterparts in Poland and Hungary, Ukraine's other neighbours.
Officials in Bucharest have criticised Ukrainian authorities for withholding information about the incident, which forced evacuations near the scene in Lviv, Ukraine.

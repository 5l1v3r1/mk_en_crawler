BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana proposed on Monday (26 January) that the name of NATO's Partnership for Peace programme be changed to Partnership for Security. 
The main goal of the programme will be to create a "security culture'', he added, at a seminar called ''Romania-NATO, Ten Years of Partnership for Peace". 
Romania expects to join NATO in late May, with six other candidates.

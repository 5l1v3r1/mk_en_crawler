ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis defended the sale of part of the government's stake in OTE, Greece's largest telecom company, to Deutsche Telekom. 
Last week, the government decided to sell 20% of its stake for 2.5 billion euros. 
At a hearing in parliament Friday (May 16th), Karamanlis said the deal would protect national interests, as the government would maintain its decision-making role in the company. 
Under the deal, the government will keep five of the ten seats on the board of directors, though Deutsche Telekom will be able to appoint OTE's CEO. 
Karamanlis added that the government has assured there will be no job cuts for the next three years and that Deutsche Telekom will not be able to sell its shares without government approval.
Opposition parties are not convinced however. 
George Papandreou, leader of the largest one, PASOK, said his party would request a special parliamentary committee to investigate the deal.

ROME, Italy -- The members of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) tripartite presidency had an audience with the Pope on Friday (21 March), presenting him with an official invitation to visit their country. 
Dragan Covic, a Catholic, and his Muslim and Orthodox Serb counterparts, Sulejman Tihic and Mirko Sarovic, also gave Pope John Paul II a plaque symbolising the new ethnic unity in BiH. 
They announced afterwards that the pontiff will visit Banja Luka on 22 June to beatify Ivan Merz, a Bosnian Croat who devoted his life to religion in the early 1900s. 
Approximately 10 per cent of the BiH population is Catholic.

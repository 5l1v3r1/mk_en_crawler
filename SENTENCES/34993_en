THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeals hearing for Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic began Monday (8 December) at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The commander of Bosnian Croat troops in central BiH from 1992-1994 was convicted in March 2000 for atrocities committed against Muslims during the war and sentenced to 45 years in prison. 
Blaskic's lawyers are appealing, claiming new documents belonging to the Croatian intelligence service uncovered in 2000 prove the general had not ordered and was unaware of the crimes.

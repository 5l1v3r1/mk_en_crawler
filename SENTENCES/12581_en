PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN-run Kosovo Trust Agency announced on Tuesday (7 June) that it is putting 20 state-run firms on the block, including a wood and glass processing factory, a paint factory, an industrial metal processing company, a large bakery, a soda bottling plant, warehouses and restaurants.
Bidders must submit their offers by 31 August.
This would be the sixth group of firms to be privatised in the province.
Also Tuesday, UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors said they would not contest a ruling that grants provisional release to former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj.
His lawyer says Haradinaj can return to the province this week to await the start of his trial in The Hague.

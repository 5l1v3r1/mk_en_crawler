WASHINGTON, United States -- International news agencies reported Friday (13 June) that US Secretary of State Colin Powell is likely to release an estimated $50m in aid to Serbia-Montenegro, following the arrest of one of the UN tribunal's most wanted war crimes suspects.
Congress has given Powell until Sunday to certify whether Belgrade is co-operating sufficiently with the UN court.
Friday's dramatic arrest of Col Veselin Sljivancanin is seen as likely to tilt the scales in favour of certification.
In other news, Jovica Stanisic, the former chief of Slobodan Milosevic's secret police, appeared before the UN tribunal on Friday to plead not guilty to war crimes charges.
He was arrested in Belgrade in March during the crackdown on organised crime which followed the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Stanisic spent time in a Belgrade hospital before being transferred to The Hague.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown will discuss sustainable refugee return issues with the relevant government institutions, Ashdown's spokesperson, Mario Brkic, told FENA news agency on Thursday (11 August). 
The talks are in response to a letter sent on behalf of 90 refugee and displaced associations, calling for Ashdown to remove the barriers for these processes. 
The associations say that local authorities -- who are managing the issue -- are preoccupied with reconstructing homes, and are ignoring the reintegration of returnees to their old communities.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU reportedly has again warned Montenegro that establishing criteria to guarantee the democratic conduct of a future independence referendum is more important than the date of the poll.
Monday's (31 October) edition of the Podgorica daily Dan quotes EU security chief Javier Solana's spokesperson, Cristina Gallach, as saying the referendum must be organised on the basis of European standards.
Montenegro wants to hold the vote early next year.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday (January 17th) he was saddened by a protest at the opening of a giant football stadium built by the government.
Galatasaray Stadium was inaugurated on Saturday in Istanbul at a ceremony attended by Erdogan.
Some fans booed him, prompting him to walk out of the ceremony.
On Monday, Erdogan described it as an orchestrated protest, adding that as the football club had not spent a cent on building the 52,000-seat Turk Telekom Arena, his government did not deserve such attitude.
According to local media, the protest was spurred by some officials who suggested the football club had not properly paid the rent for its old stadium.

TIRANA, Albania -- The 12 parties represented in parliament again failed to reach a consensus on the date of the next local elections and on an elections reform bill, during a roundtable discussion Thursday (October 5th) organised by President Alfred Moisiu. 
Afterwards, Moisiu said he was disappointed that, for almost a year, the parties have failed to overcome their deadlock on electoral reform. 
Unless they act, Moisiu said, he would be the one to select the date of the elections.
Also, Thursday the opposition and the government exchanged harsh words regarding national security. 
The opposition insisted that the cabinet, and especially Interior Minister Sokol Olldashi, explain how a Turkish airliner departing from Tirana Airport was hijacked earlier this week.

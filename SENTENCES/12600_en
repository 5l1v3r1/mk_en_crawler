SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian President Boris Tadic offered an apology to the people of BiH on Monday (6 December), the first day of his three-day visit.
"I apologise to all those who suffered from crimes committed in the name of the Serb people," he said after a meeting with the members of the country's tripartite presidency.
He went on to add that crimes are committed by individuals, not nations and that the Serb people too had been subjected to war crimes.
"I think that all of us owe an apology to each other," Tadic said.
He was the first Serbian president to visit BiH after it gained independence from the former Yugoslavia.

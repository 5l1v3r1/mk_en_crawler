SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik said on Thursday (December 16th) that RS will mark its entity lines despite the opinion of the Office of the High Representative (OHR), which says the procedure is unnecessary.
Speaking to reporters in Sarajevo, Dodik said that with its stance, the OHR only proves the pointlessness of its existence.
"Marking the line is necessary from a purely pragmatic point of view.
It has been established and is not controversial, but it should be transferred on the ground," Dodik said.

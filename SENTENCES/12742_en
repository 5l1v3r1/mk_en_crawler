BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said Saturday (4 December) that the incident involving President Boris Tadic's convoy last week was a traffic violation, not an assassination attempt.
The statement followed a thorough investigation and interrogation of Miroslav Cimpl, an employee of the US Embassy in Belgrade, whose car struck Tadic's convoy.
On Saturday, the Belgrade District Court fined Cimpl and sentenced him to 20 days in jail.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic has recognised the results of Montenegro's referendum on independence.
"I supported the preservation of a joint state, but as a democratic president of a democratic republic, I recognise the expression of the free will of the Montenegrin citizens," he said in a statement Tuesday (23 May).
Tadic also called for continuing close ties between the two countries.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said his cabinet is prepared to recognise the referendum when results become official.

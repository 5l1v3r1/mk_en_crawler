ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament approved the nomination Wednesday (July 7th) of Drazen Bosnjakovic as the new justice minister. 
The vote was 80-21, with two abstentions. 
Bosnjakovic will replace Ivan Simonovic, who is heading to New York this month to become UN assistant secretary-general for human rights. 
Bosnjakovic was first elected to parliament in 2003 and was re-elected in 2007. 
In 2008, he was appointed state secretary in the justice ministry. 
He was handpicked for the new position by Kosor and Simonovic, given his knowledge of work at the ministry.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- A powerful bomb blast Tuesday (12 September) evening in the southeast city of Diyarbakir killed 11 people and injured 17.
Seven of the dead were children.
The authorities say the explosion occurred at a bus station near a popular park in Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-populated city in Turkey.
Earlier Tuesday, retired General Joseph Ralston, the US special co-ordinator for the fight against the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), arrived in Ankara for a two-day visit.
The main purpose of the visit is to boost co-operation between the United States and Turkey in combating the PKK, which Turkey says has bases in northern Iraq.

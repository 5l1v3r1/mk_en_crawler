BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Milorad Dodik and Zlatko Lagumdzija agreed during a meeting in Banja Luka on Friday (November 26th) that the new central level government should be established as soon as possible. 
Dodik told journalists that party delegations will meet again at the end of next week in Sarajevo to discuss the topic, as well as unresolved issues related to constitutional reform, state and military property, Brcko District status and the population census. 
Lagumdzija said that the two parties still have disagreements but are willing to find a solution for the sake of BiH's Euro-Atlantic and EU integration, and the country's social and economic progress. 
The SDP and the SNSD emerged as the main parties in parliament after the October 3rd general elections. 
Each will get eight of the 42 seats in the House of Representatives.

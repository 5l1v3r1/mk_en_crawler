SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Spain officially ended its military mission in BiH on Monday (October 18th) after 18 years of peacekeeping.
More than 46,000 Spanish soldiers have served in BiH as part of international military operations since 1992.
In that time, 22 soldiers and one interpreter were killed.
Several dozen Spanish military experts will remain in BiH to help train the army.

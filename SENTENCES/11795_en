NIKOPOL, Bulgaria -- A ceremony marking the start of construction of a new Bulgarian-Romanian border crossing at Nikopol-Turnu Magurele was held on Saturday (16 April). 
The project, which also envisions the construction of a new ferryboat terminal, is financed under the EU PHARE programme, with completion expected by autumn 2006.
In other news, Bulgaria and Serbia agreed to enhance bilateral transport and communications ties, as well as co-operation in interstate border control, during a meeting of senior government officials Friday. 
Starting in 2006, the two countries would run a joint border railway station check in Dimitrovgrad, Serbia to reduce the amount of time trains spend at the border.

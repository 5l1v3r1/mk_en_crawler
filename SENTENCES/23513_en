PRISTINA, Kosovo--The EU will find practical ways to prevent Kosovo from becoming "a black hole" so as not to be a constant drain on European financials or resources, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (March 25th).
Rehn was speaking to journalists in Prague several days before the next meeting of the EU foreign ministers.
He also said it is of utmost importance for the Balkans to be included in the EU agenda.
The global financial crisis and its effect on member states has been the dominating issue lately.

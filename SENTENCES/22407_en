BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Serbian Radical Party (SRS) deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic on Thursday (September 11th) announced he intends to establish his own party, likely next week. 
Last week, Nikolic resigned after a disagreement with SRS leader Vojislav Seselj over the party's position on ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
After splitting from the SRS, he formed a new parliamentary caucus called Forward Serbia. 
Nikolic told the Belgrade daily Blic that SRS Secretary-General Aleksandar Vucic will join the new party.

TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele has urged Western Balkan countries to fully mobilise for EU membership, but at the same time said the quality of the process is more important than the speed of it. 
The main challenge for the countries in the region is overcoming the difficult past and showing readiness to embrace a European agenda, Fuele told Deutche Welle on Thursday (October 14th). 
"There are unresolved bilateral issues in the region, which can influence the membership process, and that is why we encourage these countries to find solutions," Fuele said. 
He added that in the EU integration process, countries will be assessed based on individual merits.

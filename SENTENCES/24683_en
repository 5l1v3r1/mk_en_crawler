PRISTINA, Kosovo -- As of Saturday (June 6th), Turkey lifted its visa regime for Kosovo citizens holding newer passports, not those with older ones issued by UNMIK. 
Foreign ministry officials say it reflects a new phase of bilateral co-operation.
In other news, Serbian authorities have issued about 1,400 biometric passports to Kosovo Albanians, local media reported on Monday. 
However, the EU suggested that Belgrade tighten conditions for ethnic Albanians seeking passports. 
The EU has warned that if Serbia continues to issue biometric passports to Kosovo residents, it will delay the visa liberalisation process for Serbian citizens.

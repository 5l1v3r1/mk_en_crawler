BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor's office on Friday (June 26th) charged 17 former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) with crimes against civilians committed in eastern Kosovo in 1999.
The accused are part of the so-called Gnjilane Group that allegedly killed at least 52 Roma, Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the town of Gnjilane between June and October 1999.
Charges also include illegal detention, inhumane treatment, torture, rape and mutilation.
Nine members of the group were arrested last December, and are in custody in Belgrade.
The other eight remain at large and will be tried in absentia, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
All face up to 20 years in prison.

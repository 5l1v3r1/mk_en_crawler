LUXEMBOURG -- Turkey took a key step on Monday (12 June) towards membership in the EU, opening the first chapter -- science and research -- in its accession talks with the European Commission.
EU foreign ministers first had to persuade Cyprus to allow Ankara to begin the negotiations, despite the fact that Turkey has not yet opened its ports and airspace to Cypriot ships and planes.
Late Monday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Turkey must honour its commitments regarding Cyprus.
Ankara, he added, must also make "serious progress" on press freedoms, end discrimination against non-Muslims and improve living conditions in the Kurdish southeast.
In turn, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul signaled that Ankara would not make any moves regarding Cyprus until the EU ends the economic isolation of Turkish Cypriots.
In Athens meanwhile, Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis voiced satisfaction with the compromise, describing it as "a positive development in extremely complex and difficult negotiations, during which Athens backed the justified concerns of Cyprus".

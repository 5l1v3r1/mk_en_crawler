SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The World Bank is recommending that Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH (FBiH) harmonise economic policy, particularly public investment strategies.
In an economic newsletter published on Thursday (February 7th), the Bank said the two entities and state-level government should select common priorities for public investments so they can facilitate long-term social and economic development.
The Bank said that the decision by RS to spend some of its privatisation income on education, healthcare and communal infrastructure is not appropriate, given the healthcare and education budgets already account for a high 6.1% and 5.2% of GDP, respectively.

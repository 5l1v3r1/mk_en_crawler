BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission is again condemning campaign-related incidents at the weekend.
This time, eight shots were fired early Sunday at the office of the Democratic Union for Integration, an ethnic Albanian party, in Tetovo.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokeswoman Kristina Nagy on Monday (May 19th) underlined the need to investigate such incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice.

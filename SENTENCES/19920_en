ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey should lift the ban on wearing Islamic headscarves in colleges and universities as part of the new constitution, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (September 18th). 
He insisted that the change would strengthen the secular character of the Turkish state, as the ban unfairly restricts access to higher education for some girls. 
But critics of the proposed move fear that lifting the ban would gradually lead to all women in Turkey being forced to wear headscarves.
Also on Tuesday, Erdogan told students at the police academy in Ankara that his government is committed to waging an all-out war on terror. 
He added that terrorists pose a threat to every country in the world, necessitating a united front against terrorism.

VIENNA, Austria -- EU Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner said no change in Kosovo's status is expected before the spring. 
She told Vienna's daily Die Presse that she expects no changes before March or April and said the EU would proceed with its plan to send a police and judicial mission to Kosovo to secure peace and stability. 
The commissioner added that the UN would likely approve a resolution soon, giving a green light to the deployment. 
Serbia bitterly opposes the move, condemning the plan in a resolution approved by parliament Wednesday. 
Slovenia, which assumes the rotating EU presidency next week, dismissed the resolution as a campaign ploy meant for domestic consumption.

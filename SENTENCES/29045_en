ANKARA, Turkey -- Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said on Friday (August 6th) that trade relations with Iran will continue despite recent UN sanctions.
Speaking to journalists in Trabzon, Yildiz said Turkey has no plans to curb Iranian petroleum trade, since the UN sanctions do not cover trade.
Turkish companies are importing crude oil from Iran and selling refined products back in return.
The government continues to support diplomatic channels at the EU and UN level to solve the issue with Iran's nuclear programme.

ATHENS, Greece -- Strong explosions rocked Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki early on Tuesday (May 19th), heavily damaging two new police stations but causing no injuries, media reported. 
One bomb exploded in the Athens district of Pentelis, where the station was to open at the weekend. 
The second rocked the newly constructed police station in Thessaloniki. 
An anonymous call to a local newspaper warned of the bombings, but police had no time to defuse the devices. 
Later, a newly emerged terrorist group calling itself the "Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire Athens-Thessaloniki" claimed responsibility for the attacks.
In other news, Greece confirmed its first swine flu case late Monday. 
Medical tests showed a student who returned from the United States at the weekend was infected with the H1N1 virus, Deputy Health Minister George Papagiorgos told a news conference. 
The student is under observation at an Athens hospital.
Also Monday, a prosecutor pressed charges against "all parties responsible" for criminal offences related to a real estate deal between the state and the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. 
The indictment names no specific person but is considered an important step towards eventual prosecution. 
The Vatopedi case caused a major political scandal last fall and prompted two cabinet members -- Merchant Marine Minister George Voulgarakis and government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos -- to resign. 
The monastery allegedly received prime state-owned real estate in exchange for cheap rural land, resulting in a loss of at least 100m euros for the state.

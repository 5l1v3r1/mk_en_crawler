SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A new survey on public opinion and media coverage shows that 75 per cent of Bulgarians do not consider the country ready for EU membership.
It also finds that highly critical press coverage -- especially on topics such as corruption and organised crime -- is playing a strong role in influencing those perceptions.
According to the Alpha Research agency, which carried out the survey, 48 per cent of press reports about the accession process are critical, while 33 per cent are positive and 19 per cent neutral.
The poll was conducted in late May and results were published Sunday (18 June).

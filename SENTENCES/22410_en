SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Thursday (September 11th) criticised a draft amendment to defence legislation that would strip him of most of his powers as commander-in-chief.
Under the new measure, the general staff would no longer be under the president's command, instead becoming subordinate to the defence ministry.
Parvanov also attacked the government for its economic policy and, in particular, budget planning that has led to huge spending.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Some 15,000 workers from the country's two biggest energy complexes, Roviani and Turceni, and the National Coal Company in Targu Jiu went on strike Wednesday (May 23rd). 
Trade unions in the energy sector are dissatisfied with the transfer of their companies from the Economy Ministry's jurisdiction to that of the Authority for State Assets' Recovery, as well as pending privatisation plans. 
Later Wednesday, a trade union in Valea Jiului announced that 4,000 more miners might join the strike.

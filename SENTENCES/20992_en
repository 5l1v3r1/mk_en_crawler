BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade is ready to give Kosovo 95% of its competencies, but not those related to Serbia's territorial integrity and sovereignty, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told Belgrade-based B92 radio on Tuesday (October 2nd).
He said the offer would top the agenda during the next round of direct talks in Brussels between Belgrade and Pristina.
On Wednesday, Jeremic opened a two-day international conference in Belgrade on countries affected by cluster bombs.
He described Serbia as a direct victim of these munitions and is considering a unilateral moratorium on their use.

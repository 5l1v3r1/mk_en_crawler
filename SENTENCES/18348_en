BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey will respond to problems in its accession talks with the EU by accelerating reforms, the country's ambassador to Brussels said in an interview Sunday (January 14th).
Volkan Bozkir added that Turkey had accepted the freezing of negotiations in certain areas in a " calm and professional way", demonstrating its desire to maintain relations with the Union.
The government plans to draft a list of laws that would have to be adopted to meet EU standards by 2013.
Officials would then prioritise the list.
Bozkir noted, however, that there are no immediate plans to revoke a controversial article which makes it a crime to insult the Turkish nation and character.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn welcomed the statement but said Ankara would be judged by actual achievements.
In other news Sunday, French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy kicked off his presidential campaign with an attack on Turkey's aspirations to join the EU.
"Not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe, beginning with Turkey, which has no place inside the EU," Sarkozy told members of the country's ruling Union for a Popular Movement.
Sarkozy is seen as the only real rival to Socialist candidate Segolene Royal.

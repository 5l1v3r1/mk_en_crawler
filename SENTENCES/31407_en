ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities reported on Saturday (26 April) that they have arrested 17 individuals suspected of smuggling people into the country. 
They allegedly helped at least 75 people from Albania and the former Yugoslav republics enter Croatia illegally, on their way to Slovenia and the West.
In other news, police report that they have found an arms cache on a small island off the Dalmatian coast. 
Investigators say the weapons were smuggled into Croatia from other former Yugoslav republics and were bound for the West.
Meanwhile, Croatia's president, prime minister and army commanders met Friday to discuss army restructuring. 
All agreed reforms are occurring at a satisfactory pace and that efforts should be made to hire those personnel affected by downsizing.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN police and KFOR launched an investigation Monday (4 August) into the attack which killed Satish Menon, an Indian police officer. 
UN officials told reporters that rocks had been placed on a road near Slatina to force the police vehicle off the road. 
Assailants then opened fire, killing Menon. 
The British soldier was unhurt. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi called the killing an attempt by criminal elements to destabilise the province. 
Charles Brayshaw, the acting head of UNMIK, characterised the murder as "repugnant" and "a direct attack on international forces of law and order".

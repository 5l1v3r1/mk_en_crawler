BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting in Brussels on Monday (May 14th), the EU foreign ministers praised the results of last week's Southeast Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP) summit in Zagreb.
The EU diplomats welcomed the move to transform the EU-sponsored Stability Pact for SEE into a Regional Co-operation Council, which will be locally based and streamlined.
Separately Monday, the EU General Affairs Council also discussed the bloc's policy in the Black Sea region.
The Council backed a recent proposal by the European Commission for enhanced co-operation and development of good neighbourly ties with regional states that are not EU members.

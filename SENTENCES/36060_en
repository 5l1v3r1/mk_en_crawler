ZAGREB, Croatia -- Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic said Tuesday (23 March) that past reforms of his ministry and the army failed to achieve desired results.
He called for a new reorganisation with clear objectives, such as strengthening Croatia's defence potential to meet the needs and standards of the EU and NATO.
In other news, Croatian border police officials and their colleagues from Bosnia and Herzegovina say their co-operation in fighting cross-border crime has been successful.
They cite detentions of car smugglers and illegal immigrants, as well as the smashing of drug trafficking rings.
Also Tuesday, the Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS), the largest ethnic Serb party in the country, threatened to withdraw its support from the government.
SDSS says the government has been slow in giving back property to Serb returnees.

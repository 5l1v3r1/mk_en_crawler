SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia has decided to nominate its leader, incumbent Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, to run in next month's presidential race. 
The largest ethnic Albanian party in the country, the Democratic Union for Integration -- which is also a minor member of the government coalition -- says it is nominating its secretary general, Gezim Ostreni. 
The election had to be moved up to 14 April, after President Boris Trajkovski died last month in a plane crash. 
Speaking on Wednesday (17 March), EU spokeswoman Sheena Thompson urged all eligible voters to participate.

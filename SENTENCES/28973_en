SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH acquitted on Thursday (April 8th) two former senior Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) officials charged with abuse of power.
The court found that there was no solid evidence against former Prime Minister Edhem Bicakcic and former Finance Minister Dragan Covic, both of whom were accused of embezzling state funds.
They allegedly allocated millions of US dollars to resolve housing issues of civil servants without government approval.
Prosecutors say they will appeal the verdicts.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Georgi Parvanov are at odds after Parvanov criticised Borisov's government Sunday (November 8th) for going after former Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev.
He faces charges for failing to handle national security reports properly.
Parvanov suggests resources would be better spent going after important crime bosses, rather than a former prime minister for "mishandling some folders".
Borisov retorted that the previous government, which Parvanov helped establish, hadn't done anything for the country, and that the president was attempting to interfere with the judicial system and protect former cabinet members.
Shanishev was Parvanov's successor as chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

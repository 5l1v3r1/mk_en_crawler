SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Voters headed for the polls across Macedonia on Wednesday (14 April) to elect a new president.
Four candidates are vying for the post, but none is likely to cross the 50 per cent threshold.
A resulting runoff between the two top finishers would be held in two weeks.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the ruling Socialists and Sasko Kedev of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE are considered the frontrunners.
Gezim Ostreni is the candidate of the Democratic Union for Integration, while Zudi Xhelili is the nominee of the Democratic Party of Albanians.
In other news, Macedonia will receive a report Wednesday compiled by authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina on President Boris Trajkovski's fatal plane crash, which occurred on 26 February near Mostar.
No official details have been released, but media reports say the crash has been blamed on pilot error.

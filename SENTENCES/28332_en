TIRANA, Albania -- EU Ambassador Helmuth Lohan said on Thursday (June 17th) that reforming the justice system requires political consensus, which would bring transparency in the process.
He was speaking at the closing of the European Assistance Mission to the Albanian Justice System (EURALIUS), which has helped the local judiciary embrace democratic European standards.
Established as a project funded by the European Commission under the 2006 CARDS programme, it aimed to create an independent and transparent judiciary that would boost public trust in institutions.

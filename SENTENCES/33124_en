SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragan Covic, the Croat member of the tripartite presidency, told reporters on Friday (16 May) that the BiH government has set aside nearly $3m to cover preparations for next month's visit by Pope John II.
BiH will also issue a stamp to commemorate the visit.
The focus of the trip will be Banja Luka, where the pope is to beatify 20th century Roman Catholic theologian Ivan Merz.
The visit is expected to encourage religious tolerance for the Catholic minority in the Bosnian Serb entity.
In neighbouring Croatia, Catholics celebrated the Pope's 83rd birthday on Sunday by unveiling a statue of John Paul II in Marija Bistrica.
He visited the town five years ago and is to pay his third visit to Croatia next month.

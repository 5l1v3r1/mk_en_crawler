BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Branko Pavlovic, who headed Serbia's privatisation panel, was fired Thursday (15 July) following several days of argument with Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic.
After being sacked, Pavlovic charged that some members of government had prevented him from disclosing all corrupt practices in the privatisation process.
Dinkic said results were poor during Pavlovic's tenure and denied he had been sacked for personal reasons.

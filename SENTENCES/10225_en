BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said talks on Kosovo's final status could take place in the summer of 2005, but only if the international community determines that the necessary progress has been achieved by that time, particularly with regard to implementation of standards.
In an interview with the Belgrade-based English language magazine Cord, Jessen-Petersen said that resolving the province's status would benefit not only Kosovo, but the entire region.

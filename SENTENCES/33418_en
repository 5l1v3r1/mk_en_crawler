TIRANA, Albania -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Tirana on Friday (2 May), joining the foreign ministers of Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia in signing the US-Adriatic Partnership Charter. 
The initiative is meant to help the three Balkan nations achieve their goal of NATO membership. 
"This charter will serve as a roadmap to them on their path to Euro-Atlantic integration," Powell said. 
"Every European democracy that seeks NATO membership and is ready to share NATO responsibility should be welcomed into the Alliance," he added.
Also Friday, Powell signed an agreement with Albania that would grant US and Albanian citizens immunity from prosecution by the new International Criminal Court.
In talks Saturday with his Croatian counterpart, Tonino Picula, Powell thanked Zagreb for its continued support for US led efforts in Iraq and the international anti-terrorist coalition.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Starting on May 1st, all citizens of Kosovo will have to obtain a visa to travel to Croatia, the government decided on Friday (April 4th).
The measure was introduced because Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on February 17th, has not yet adopted rules on the nationality and passports of its citizens, the government said in a statement.
As soon as the issue is settled, Zagreb and Pristina, whose citizens still use documents issued by UNMIK to travel, can launch talks on the visa regime.

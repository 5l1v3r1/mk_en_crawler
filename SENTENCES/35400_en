NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A new poll published Sunday (18 April) finds opposition among Greek Cypriots to the UN plan for the reunification of the island may be declining.
The survey found the number of people determined to vote against the blueprint dropped from 71 per cent on 14 April to 54 per cent on 16 April.
Those who are undecided increased from 17 per cent to 29 per cent, while those who support the plan increased to 17 per cent from 12 per cent.
A poll by a Turkish newspaper over the same period indicated that 62.1 per cent of Turkish Cypriots would vote for reunification.
Simultaneous referenda will be held on both parts of the divided island on 24 April.
On Saturday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen suggested that the Union would consider easing sanctions against the so-called "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", should the Greek Cypriots reject the reunification plan during the referenda.
On Sunday, Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis said there is no "last chance for Cyprus".
He said efforts to resolve the dispute would continue as long as necessary.

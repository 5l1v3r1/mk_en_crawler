BRUSSELS, Belgium-- The European Commission (EC) is set to give Croatia a conditional date for concluding EU membership talks by the end of 2009, media reported on Tuesday (October 21st), citing EU sources. 
According to the sources, the EC progress report on Croatia -- expected on November 5th -- will say Zagreb can conclude accession talks next year, provided it meets several technical criteria. 
They include judicial reform, stronger measures against corruption and organised crime, and reform of shipyards and steelworks in line with EU state aid rules. 
The EC reportedly will give a green light to concluding accession talks with Zagreb despite opposition from France and Germany. 
They insist there can be no further EU expansion until all member states ratify the Lisbon Treaty.

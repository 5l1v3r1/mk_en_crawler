BRUSSELS, Belgium -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte again is urging the EU not to resume Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Serbia until it arrests fugitive indictee Ratko Mladic. 
Del Ponte spoke to reporters after talks with Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht in Brussels on Wednesday (February 14th). 
She complained that support from the international community -- in terms of bringing top fugitives to justice -- seems to be waning. 
The tribunal's mandate ends in 2010.
Separately Wednesday, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot visited Belgrade and expressed support for Serbia's EU prospects, as long as the government meets remaining obligations to the UN tribunal.

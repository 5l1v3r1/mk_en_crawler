OSIJEK, Croatia -- The Osijek County Court resumed the trial Tuesday (November 28th) of a former Croatian Army member, Enes Viteskic, charged with committing war crimes against ethnic Serbs.
Viteskic is accused of having participated in the murder of 18 Serb civilians in Paulin Dvor near Osijek in December 1991.
Last June, the Croatian Supreme Court overturned his earlier acquittal and ordered a re-trial.

TIRANA, Albania -- The education ministry issued a report Wednesday (5 January) indicating that up to 9,000 children left school during the past academic year.
The report found that education problems are most serious in the towns of Lac and Mallakastra, where the economic situation is the worst in Albania.
In general, children in rural or outlying areas are more likely to leave school to start jobs, the ministry said.

RIJEKA, Croatia -- Looking tired in sweltering heat, Pope John Paul II described families as the bedrock of society on Sunday (8 June) as he celebrated Mass in this Adriatic seaport. 
The 83-year-old pope, spending his first Pentecost Sunday outside the Vatican, encouraged young Croats to marry, raise families and help their children overcome temptations. 
The pope said he empathised with the struggle of families to make ends meet and urged the country's politicians to address the problem. 
Joblessness in Croatia is about 20 per cent, and the average monthly wage is just $450. 
The pope is nearing the end of a draining, five-day, five-city trip in heat that was blamed for the deaths Saturday of two worshipers in eastern Croatia.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Political dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is expected to resume this week, when Serbian and Kosovo representatives meet in Vienna, according to statements issued Saturday (25 September).
The talks will be held within the framework of a consultative meeting of the Kosovo Contact Group that would focus on plans for Kosovo's decentralisation.
Belgrade media reports that if some of Serbia's proposals are adopted, Belgrade might encourage the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the province's 23 October parliamentary elections.

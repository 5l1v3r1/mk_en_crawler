WASHINGTON, United States -- The US administration is launching a new initiative to settle the issue of Kosovo's final status, the International Herald Tribune reported Monday (23 May). 
R. 
Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of state for political affairs, is due to travel to Europe later this week to discuss steps that would be recommended to Kosovo authorities, Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
The report quoted Burns as saying the first aim is to settle Kosovo's status by the end of the year. 
The second goal is to get the government of Serbia-Montenegro to extradite all war crimes indictees to The Hague. 
Finally, Burns said, steps must be taken by BiH to establish a unification government that integrates the country's ethnic communities.

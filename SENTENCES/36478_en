STRASBOURG, France -- A Council of Europe (CoE) team tasked with monitoring the general elections in Kosovo started work on Monday (9 August). 
The vote will be held on 23 October. 
The CoE mission comprises three stages -- regulation of voter registration, monitoring of election campaigns and observation of the voting and counting process. 
The team's leader, Bulgarian diplomat Andrey Tehov, has called for free, fair and transparent elections.
In other news, Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi appealed to Kosovo Serbs to participate in the elections and thus use their democratic opportunity and legal right to vote. 
"Your vote is a vote for your future and for your place in the institutions of Kosovo," he said in statement. 
Only two small Serb parties have registered for the elections.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The OSCE mission in Kosovo says the judicial system has failed to address cases of domestic violence.
This "is not just a private matter -- something that stays within the family and no one dares to speak about.
It is a matter of public concern.
We must speak about it and combat this serious crime," Deputy head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo, Markku Laamanen, said on Wednesday (November 25th) at a conference marking International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.
He noted that most victims of domestic violence are women and children.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- On Monday (17 March), Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana and a delegation from the OECD agreed to launch a pilot project to fight corruption.
The international organisation has been providing free technical assistance to that end.
But this new project would help the country implement the recently approved amendments to the anti-corruption law.
That same day, opposition parties threatened to file a no confidence motion against the government over those amendments.
They say they are a mere imitation of reform.

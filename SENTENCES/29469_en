PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the security situation in Kosovo is stable, but he warned about the situation in the country's north, according local media.
Instability in the north should not be underestimated the report says, according to the leaks quoted by Kosovo media on Sunday (August 1st).
The document, which is due to be presented on Wednesday in New York, mentions the early July violent protests by Serbs after the opening of a Kosovo government office in north Mitrovica, and the attack on Kosovo Serb lawmaker Petar Miletic in the divided town.
Local media are reporting that Ban will meet with Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni in New York on Tuesday and the meeting will be an opportunity to clarify relations between UNMIK Chief Lamberto Zannier and the Kosovo government.
The latter has ignored the UN representative since the declaration of independence in February 2008.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A draft report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (CEPA) reportedly suggests that Turkey no longer needs to be on the list of monitored states.
Turkey was included in CEPA's monitoring list in 1996 for failing to meet European democratic standards.
According to local press reports Thursday (26 February), the new draft, suggesting Turkey be dropped from the list, would likely be approved by CEPA in April.
That would bolster prospects for launching EU accession negotiations.
In other news Thursday, an IMF mission arrived in Istanbul to complete the second stage of talks on the seventh review of the stand-by agreement with the Fund.
On the table is the next $500m tranche to Turkey.

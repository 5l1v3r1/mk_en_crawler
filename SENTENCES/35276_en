BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb Parliament is urging the entity's government to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In a declaration adopted Thursday (22 April), lawmakers reminded the ministers that their obligations include calling for voluntary surrender, as well as activities to apprehend war crimes suspects.
Parliament also urged police to better plan their operations.
An unarmed man was killed recently when Bosnian Serb police raided his home in search of his brother.
In other news, the World Bank warned BiH that it would forfeit $97m in loans if it fails to adopt three laws by 7 May.
The Bank wants parliament to pass legislation on public procurement, higher education and veterans' benefits.
Officials from the Council of Europe and the Office of the High Representative echoed the message.

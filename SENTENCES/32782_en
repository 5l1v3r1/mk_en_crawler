SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers endorsed a bill Monday (9 December) on trade involving arms and military equipment and forwarded it to parliament for urgent adoption.
The draft provides for the establishment of state-level controls over the export and import of arms, regulates the procedures for companies trading in weapons and imposes sanctions in case of violations.
The endorsement comes in the wake of the Orao scandal, involving illegal arms sales to Iraq.

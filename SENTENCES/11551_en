ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt presented the ministry's autumn agenda on Thursday (21 July), saying a new anti-corruption strategy has been drafted.
One of the main missions will be to strengthen control over those fields registering the greatest number of corruption cases, she said.
Another priority for the ministry would be the launch of a nationwide information database for the judiciary, which would boost effectiveness and faster verdicts.
Also Thursday, Skare-Ozbolt confirmed that the UN tribunal in The Hague is examining war crimes allegedly committed in 1991 against Serb civilians in the eastern Croatian town of Osijek.
She provided no details, but said she hoped the tribunal would allow the domestic courts to process the case.
Meanwhile, media reports have speculated that Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks, who led the Osijek Crisis Management Centre in 1991, could face charges brought by The Hague.
Talking to reporters Thursday, he said he is not afraid of an investigation, as he had no command authority over the military or police units in Osijek.

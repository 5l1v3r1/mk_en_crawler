SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The president of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Sulejman Tihic, is asking leaders of the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties to meet this week to continue talks on constitutional changes. 
The session is scheduled for Thursday (November 12th) in Sarajevo. 
In October, leaders of the seven main political parties held two rounds of talks with senior EU and US officials at Camp Butmir, to try to break the political stalemate that has stalled progress towards EU and NATO accession. 
The talks ended with no agreement on a package of reforms.

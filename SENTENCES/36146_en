SUVI LUKAVAC, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- During talks with Kosovo and international officials on Saturday (13 March), UN Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping Jean-Marie Guehenno called for reconciliation. 
In comments to reporters at the village of Suvi Lukavac, Guehenno said the return of displaced people to their homes served as a positive example to others. 
"We want more people to come back. 
I think it is possible but it needs real willingness and change of hearts and minds," he said.
Arriving in Belgrade, Guehenno met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
He urged better co-operation among Serbian authorities, UNMIK and the Kosovo interim administration. 
Kostunica, in turn, sought more protection for returning Serbs.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Minister of Foreign Affairs Mladen Ivanic met with Dutch counterpart Bernard Bot on Monday (2 May) at The Hague to discuss recent progress in army and police reforms, as well as co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Bot acknowledged gains BiH has made, saying he hopes the trend will continue. 
He vowed continued Dutch support for the effort. 
In turn, Ivanic said he hopes the EU will soon pick a date for starting talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH.
In other news Monday, Federation of BiH Defence Minister Miroslav Nikolic said obligatory military service would likely be abolished by the end of the year. 
The decision, he said, would be in line with ongoing reforms aimed at turning the military into a force made up entirely of professional soldiers.

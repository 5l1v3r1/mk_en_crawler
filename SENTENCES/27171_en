BELGRADE, Serbia/ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government announced on Thursday (December 31st) it has decided to file a lawsuit against Croatia at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that war crimes were committed against Croatia's ethnic Serb population between 1991 and 1995.
The decision was made after consultations between President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic.
In 1999, Croatia filed a genocide claim against Belgrade, demanding compensation for the human toll and material damage suffered during the 1991-1995 conflicts among the former Yugoslav republics.
Croatia says the Serbian army killed more than 20,000 Croats in ethnic cleansing campaigns.

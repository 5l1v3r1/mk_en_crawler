SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new mayor of Skopje, Trifun Kostovski, officially assumed his duties Monday (18 April) after a ceremony with predecessor Risto Penov.
Kostovski, an independent candidate backed by the opposition, won a run-off election earlier this month, defeating Penov, who was seeking a third term on the ruling coalition's ticket.
The two held talks Monday on the city's major problems, particularly hygiene, illegal construction and insufficient parking.

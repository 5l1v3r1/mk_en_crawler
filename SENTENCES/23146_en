MEDELLIN, Colombia -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic raised the Kosovo issue at the annual summit of the General Assembly of the Organisation of American States (OAS), which opened in Medellin, Colombia, on Sunday (June 1st). 
Jeremic asked the OAS to support Serbia's appeal to the UN to allow the International Court of Justice to rule on the legality of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. 
He said Serbia would also raise the issue before the UN Security Council in September and would mobilise all diplomatic, political and legal means.
Jeremic also met with OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza and will hold separate bilateral meetings with the foreign ministers of OAS member states. 
Of the 35 OAS members, only the United States, Canada, Peru and Costa Rica have recognised Kosovo's independence.

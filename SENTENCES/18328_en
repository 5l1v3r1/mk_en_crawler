NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish troops will not be removed from the area around the demolished wall on Ledra Street, Rasit Pertev, senior adviser to Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, said on Tuesday (March 13th). 
Last week, the Greek Cypriot government decided to bulldoze the so-called Green Line barrier on Ledra Street, a thoroughfare running through the mediaeval town, but said civilians could not use it until Turkish troops leave the area.

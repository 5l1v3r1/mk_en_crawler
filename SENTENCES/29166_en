SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Anyu Angelov said on Saturday (July 3rd) that Bulgaria is ready to join the US anti-missile defence shield in Europe. 
"It was important for us to talk to our American partners about how Bulgaria can contribute to the setting up of a missile defence in Europe. 
In addition to enjoying security from the shield, our country must also contribute to it," Angelov told state radio upon his return from a week-long visit to the US. 
He said the first stage of setting up the missile defence has to be completed by 2015, and the second -- in which Bulgaria will most likely participate -- in 2015-2018. 
The missile defence is expected to be fully operational by 2020.

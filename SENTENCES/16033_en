LUXEMBOURG -- Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, whose country currently holds the rotating EU Presidency, said Tuesday (October 17th) that a decision on Kosovo's future status could be put off for a few weeks or months, due to the upcoming planned elections in Serbia. 
Tuomioja was speaking to reporters after the meeting of the EU Council in Luxembourg. 
UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari is expected to submit his proposal on Kosovo's status to the six-nation Contact Group and the UN Security Council by the end of this year, but EU leaders say the timetable could be adjusted.
During a visit to Tirana, however, UNMIK head Joachim Ruecker expressed confidence that Kosovo's future would be determined by the end of this year, as scheduled. 
He described the issue as "the last piece of the Balkan puzzle".
Tuesday also saw a decision by the EU to extend the mandate of the bloc's planning team for Kosovo by three months, until March 31st, 2007. 
The team is laying the groundwork for a possible EU mission, which would replace the current UN-led one.
At its Luxembourg meeting, the EU Council urged Serbs and ethnic Albanians to adopt a constructive approach to the UN-mediated negotiations on the future status of Kosovo. 
It also called on Serbia to fulfil all outstanding obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal.

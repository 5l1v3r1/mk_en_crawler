SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A Bulgarian Border Police delegation heads to Germany on Monday (2 August) for a working visit with colleagues from the German Federal Border Guard.
The groups will discuss structural reforms in Bulgaria's border police, as well as future tasks and higher security responsibilities in light of Bulgaria's upcoming accession to the EU.
The partnership is part of a twinning project within the framework of the EU's PHARE programme.

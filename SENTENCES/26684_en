PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The foreign ministry announced on Friday (August 7th) it recalled Miljan Mugosa, third secretary at the Montenegrin embassy in the US. 
Mugosa, son of Podgorica mayor Miomir Mugosa, is suspected of attacking Podgorica-based Vijesti journalists on Wednesday.
Vijesti deputy editor-in-chief Mihailo Jovovic and photographer Boris Pejovic said they were assaulted by the mayor, his son and their guard after taking photos of their illegally parked cars on the Podgorica main street. 
The mayor said he and his son acted in self-defence.

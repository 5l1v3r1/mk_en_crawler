ANKARA, Turkey -- The party assembly of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was re-elected and nominees of party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu replaced the old assembly members during an extraordinary convention Saturday (December 18th).
Kilicdaroglu decided to hold the elections using a bloc list, allowing him to handpick 86 candidates, and party members had to elect 80 of them to form the new party assembly.
Despite that, 33 current assembly members kept their seats, but almost all supporters of ex-party leader Deniz Baykal were replaced with Kilicdaroglu's candidates.
A recent Kilicdaroglu - Baykal power struggle has affected support for the party in polls.

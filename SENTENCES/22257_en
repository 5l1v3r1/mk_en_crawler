SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry announced on Monday (November 17th) that Macedonia has initiated legal proceedings against Greece at The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) for blocking Skopje's NATO accession. 
Macedonia cites a temporary accord signed on September 13th 1995 in which Athens agreed not to hamper Macedonia's bid to become a member of the Alliance. 
At a NATO summit in Bucharest in April, Greece blocked Macedonia's bid over the long-standing name dispute between the two countries. 
Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki, who represents Macedonia in the case, said "We thought very carefully before taking this action, but we see no other way to satisfy justice and to protect our rights."
Athens, in turn, condemned Macedonia's move. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos said his country would defend itself against Macedonia's accusations and at the same time would remain committed to UN efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name dispute.
Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski is angry with the move as well. 
In a statement Monday, he said Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski had violated the constitution and the law on foreign policy and had failed to consult others.

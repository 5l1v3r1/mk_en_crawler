THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal approved on Monday (August 9th) a temporary release request filed by former Yugoslav Army General Dragoljub Ojdanic.
He will be released on August 19th to attend a memorial service for his late sister and is to return on August 24th.
Ojdanic was sentenced in February 2009 to 15 years in prison for war crimes committed against Albanians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict, but is appealing the verdict.

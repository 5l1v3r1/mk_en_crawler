ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and the IMF have completed talks on a new $10 billion stand-by arrangement, announced the State Minister in charge of the Treasury, Ali Babacan, at a joint news conference with representatives of the IMF mission Tuesday (12 April). 
Babacan added that the IMF board is expected to endorse the agreement at a session scheduled for early May. 
The new stand-by arrangement was originally closed in December 2004 but later postponed until Turkey finalises structural reforms in the banking, social and tax revenue sectors.

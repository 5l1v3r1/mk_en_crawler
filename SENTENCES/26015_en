ANKARA, Turkey -- Police announced on Wednesday (September 16th) the arrests of six people in connection with Al-Qaeda's 2003 suicide attacks in Istanbul, which left dozens dead. 
Already, seven terrorists, including a Syrian member of al-Qaeda, have been sentenced to life in prison for involvement in the attacks. 
Trucks, filled with explosives, crashed into two synagogues in Istanbul and killed about 20 people in 2003. 
A separate attack against an office of the HSBC bank in the city's centre killed 30 people.
Also Wednesday, the OSCE voiced concern over the record $2.5 billion fine levied against the Turkish media giant Dogan for unpaid taxes. 
"The amount ... 
is unprecedented and alarming," Miklos Haraszti, the OSCE's media freedom representative, said in a letter to Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, adding that the fine poses a threat to media pluralism.

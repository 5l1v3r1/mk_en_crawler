WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. 
Bush and his visiting Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, confirmed the two NATO allies' strategic partnership in a wide range of issues Tuesday (January 8th). 
After meeting with Gul at the White House, Bush reiterated that the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is a common enemy of both the US and Turkey. 
He also said that the US would like to see Turkey in the EU, as Ankara bridges Europe and the Muslim world. 
For his part, Gul reiterated that attacks by the Turkish military in northern Iraq only target the PKK. 
The United States and Turkey have been sharing military information on the movements of PKK militants, who have mounted attacks on Turkey from bases in northern Iraq.
In other news, Turkish police have arrested a man who allegedly orchestrated last week's terrorist attack in Diyarbakir, which killed six people, most of them school children. 
Media reports suggest the suspect underwent training at a PKK camp in northern Iraq.
Also Tuesday, Turkish police announced that in the past week they arrested 38 people with suspected links to al-Qaeda. 
Most of the arrests were in the eastern Van province.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday (February 19th) that Greece needs support from its EU partners to implement its austerity measures, but is not looking for a loan.
Speaking at a conference of socialist leaders in London, Papandreou said that although the country is determined to deal with its financial woes on its own, the crisis affects everyone and the government needs the support of other members of the bloc.
In London, Papandreou met with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Spain's Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, as well as British Foreign Secretary David Miliband.
Meanwhile, Greek Finance Minister Louka Katseli said in an interview with Xinhua on Friday that there is no need for additional austerity measures and suggested that the Eurozone demonstrate concrete support by preventing speculators from taking advantage of the country's debt crisis.
The austerity plan aims to slash Greece's ballooning budget deficit within three years.
Athens submitted it to the European Commission about a month ago.
EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn gave Greece until Friday to provide more details over a currency swap with US investment bank Goldman Sachs dating back to 2001, particularly regarding how it has affected the country's debt and deficit figures.
Local media reported on Saturday that authorities are investigating "people and interests" behind what are described as speculative deals that harmed the economy.
French Economy, Industry and Labour Minister Christine Lagarde has been quoted as saying that six financial and credit institutions in the US and Britain participated in these harmful speculative operations.

ZADAR, Croatia -- Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) leader Djurdja Adlesic was re-elected on Saturday (17 June) at the party's 14th congress held in Zadar. 
More than 80 per cent of the delegates supported her nomination. 
Adlesic said that the main priority of her second mandate would be to ensure at least six HSLS deputy seats in the 152-member legislature during the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2007.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- What began as a peaceful rally outside the parliament building Wednesday (January 14th) turned into a riot after a group of protesters tried to charge barricades in front of parliament.
About 2,000 students, mothers of large families, teachers, environmentalists and others gathered to protest the government's failure to deal with widespread corruption.
It turned violent after nationalists and football fans in the crowd began throwing rock-filled snowballs at police.
In all, 23 people suffered injuries and police made 170 arrests.

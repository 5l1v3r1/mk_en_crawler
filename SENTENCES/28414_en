PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX personnel on Wednesday (May 12th) searched the Prizren home of a former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander suspected of war crimes.
Prosecutors say Xhemshit Krasniqi participated in the 1999 torture of prisoners in KLA camps in Albania.
Krasniqi, who works as a Democratic Party adviser in Prizren, was not at home.
His family says police confiscated a computer, military uniforms and other belongings.

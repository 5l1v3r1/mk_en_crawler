ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki arrived in Ankara Tuesday (August 7th) for a one-day visit. 
He told reporters that he would meet with Turkish leaders to "develop co-operation â¦ on trade, economy and security". 
The Anadolu news agency reported on Monday that Ankara and Baghdad are working on a joint agreement aimed at boosting co-operation in fighting terrorism. 
Ankara says militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are using northern Iraq to stage attacks in Turkey.
On Monday, PKK separatists released nine people, including four children, who were abducted in eastern Turkey a week ago. 
The villagers were taken hostage for failing to support a Kurdish candidate in the July 22nd general elections.

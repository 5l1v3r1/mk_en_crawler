SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Two men who became fugitives after being sentenced to prison for the 2000 murder of a Bulgarian compatriot in France surrendered in Varna on Monday (February 15th). 
Georgi Zhelyazkov and Stoyan Stoichkov were sentenced in absentia to 19 and 17 years in prison respectively by an appeals' court on February 4th for stabbing 24-year-old Martin Borilski to death in his Paris apartment. 
After they missed the hearing, warrants were issued for their arrest. 
Paris had vowed to prosecute if they were not punished by Bulgaria.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo's Parliament on Wednesday (23 March) elected a new provincial government led by Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi. 
The vote was 71-36. 
President Ibrahim Rugova tapped Kosumi, 45, for the post last week, after Ramush Haradinaj's resignation and surrender to The Hague tribunal. 
Kosumi served as environment minister in Haradinaj's cabinet and is deputy leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo.
In other news, German Defence Minister Peter Struck visited Kosovo on Tuesday. 
During a meeting with Rugova, Struck called for a quick settlement of the province's final status and said Germany would keep its peacekeeping troops in Kosovo as long as necessary.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte urged Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Serbia and Montenegro on Wednesday (July 25th) to do everything they can to catch former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic. 
Del Ponte's spokeswoman Olga Kavran issued a statement noting that 12 years have passed since the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia charged Mladic and Karadzic with genocide in connection with the Srebrenica massacre and other atrocities. 
She also called on the international community to strengthen its support to find and punish all those responsible for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.

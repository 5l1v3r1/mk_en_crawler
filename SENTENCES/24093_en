BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government will propose a new candidate for interior minister by Monday (January 19th) at the latest, ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Thursday.
The previous minister, Gabriel Oprea, resigned earlier this week at the urging of his party after he failed to seek its approval before appointing Virgil Ardelean as head of the country's intelligence services.
President Traian Basescu named Dan Nica as interim minister.
On Thursday, Nica called for urgent measures to curb violence and drug dealing at schools.
In other news Thursday, the Constitutional Court deemed unconstitutional a government ordinance that forbids a pensioner to work in a public institution.
The court ruled a person cannot be forced to choose between a pension and a salary, as this would violate one's civil rights.
The emergency ordinance preventing employees from earning both salaries and pensions was among the first measures adopted by the new government to reduce spending.
Ombudsman Ioan Muraru challenged its constitutionality.

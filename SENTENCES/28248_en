PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said Monday (August 16th) that a new political process is beginning in Republika Srpska (RS) now that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled in favour of Kosovo's independence.
In an interview with the Podgorica-based daily Dan, Spiric said that if the UN General Assembly also confirms Kosovo's independence, this would open the path for RS's independence.
He added that developments in BiH's smaller entity will have impact on the overall situation in the Balkans.
Spiric stressed RS wants to exist within the frameworks of the Dayton Peace Agreement, but would oppose to the establishment of a unitary state.

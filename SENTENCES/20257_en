BELGRADE, Serbia -- The troika mediating talks on Kosovo's final status will propose giving the province "neutral status" when negotiators from Belgrade and Pristina meet next week.
Wolfgang Ischinger, the EU's representative in the talks, said on Wednesday (November 14th) that the goal would be to normalise relations between Serbia and Kosovo after talks end on December 10th.
But officials from both governments rejected the idea.
Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said Wednesday that Kosovo must remain a province of Serbia, albeit with extensive autonomy.
It is "an integral and inalienable part of Serbia's territory", he said.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu also rejected the idea.
"Kosovo's destiny is independence and entering the [EU].
We won't accept any solution that in this or in that way ...
excludes the independence of Kosovo," he said.

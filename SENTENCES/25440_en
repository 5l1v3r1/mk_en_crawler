SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski told lawmakers on Thursday (February 25th) that Macedonia has a stake in resolving its long-standing name dispute with Greece, because it would accelerate its EU and NATO integration processes.
He pointed out that during consultations with UN mediator Matthew Nimetz this week, Macedonia demonstrated willingness to intensify talks.
Gruevski added that Nimetz's visit to Athens on Friday will be essential to furthering the process.
Meanwhile, Macedonian media quoted Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras as saying that while Athens is willing to find a solution, but Skopje is blocking efforts.

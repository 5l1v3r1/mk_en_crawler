ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said Tuesday (21 September) that Islam should not be associated with terrorism and that terrorist acts must not be conducted in the name of religion.
"Terrorism is a crime against humanity," Sezer said during a meeting of the Religion Council in Ankara, stressing that savagery and fanaticism had no place in religion and Islam.
On Tuesday, meanwhile, a Kurdish group identifying itself as Kurdistan Freedom Falcons claimed responsibility for the bomb that exploded near a pop concert in Mersin, injuring 13 people.
Last month, the same group claimed responsibility for deadly bomb attacks on two Istanbul hotels.
Turkish police have linked the group to the outlawed terror group Kurdistan Workers Party, now known as KONGRA-GEL.

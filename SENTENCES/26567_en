BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and EU Commissioner-designate for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Stefan Fule voiced their commitment Sunday (January 10th) to accelerating the EU integration of Western Balkan countries. 
They have also submitted their programme for future efforts to the European Parliament. 
Fule said the ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia will be among his priorities, now that the EU has decided to unblock its separate interim trade agreement with the country. 
The SAA was endorsed in April 2008 but frozen over Serbia's insufficient co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.

ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities on Saturday (January 29th) declared a state of emergency on the islands of Kos and Rhodes in the Aegean Sea due to floods caused by torrential rains in the area.
Most roads, many houses and rural land on the two islands are under water.
The situation is worst in three villages about 50km from the city of Rhodes and in several villages on the island of Kos.

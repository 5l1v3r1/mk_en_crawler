BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country will not go to war over Kosovo, the leader of Serbia's nationalist Radical Party and top contender in the January 20th presidential election said on Tuesday (January 8th).
Tomislav Nikolic warned however that Belgrade would completely sever ties with Kosovo if it declares independence and will downgrade relations with countries that recognise it as an independent state.
Such action would likely stall the country's progress towards EU membership.
In other news, the war crimes trial of Serb Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj, who is charged with crimes against Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s, resumed at The Hague on Tuesday.
During the session, prosecutor Christine Dahl demanded that one of the judges, Frederick Harhoff of Denmark, be removed from the case in light of information that in May 1993 as a member of the Danish Helsinki Committee, he had contact with a witness the prosecution planned to call.
Seselj rejected the demand, saying further delays are unnecessary.
Tribunal President Fausto Pocar will decide.

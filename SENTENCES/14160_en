STRASBOURG, France -- The president of the Council of Europe's (CoE) Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, Giovanni Di Stasi, will pay a two-day visit to Tirana starting Monday (16 January), in a bid to help resolve the deadlock between the central Albanian government and Tirana local authorities.
According to a CoE press release published Friday, Di Stasi will hold talks with Albanian President Alfred Moisiu, Prime Minister and Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, Tirana Mayor and Socialist Party head Edi Rama, as well as the European Commission Ambassador to Albania, Lutz Salzmann.
The CoE has repeatedly urged the Albanian politicians to settle the several-month dispute over a Tirana road construction project.
Co-operation between the central and local government institutions has been halted because of the quarrel.

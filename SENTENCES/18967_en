SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian National Assembly voted on Friday (2 February) to pass constitutional amendments aimed at improving the functioning of the judiciary.
The move was made in response to criticism and demands by the EU.
The amendments remove the immunity from prosecution of judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates and create a special watchdog.
Some 192 of 240 deputies backed the changes.
EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini welcomed the changes, saying they would help strengthen the Bulgarian judicial system.
In other news, a French court has sentenced 10 Bulgarians to up to six years in jail for selling babies to Roma families.
A French intermediary received a five-year sentence, while most of the 41 recipients were given suspended sentences.
Some 28 babies were sold for 2,500 to 8,000 euros.

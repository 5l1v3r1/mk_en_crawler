ATHENS, Greece -- Journalists launched a four-day strike Thursday (April 7th) leaving the country without news on a scale not seen since 1976.
Joining journalists were technical and administrative staff in printed and electronic media.
Radio and television stations are running no news, along with the national ANA news agency.
Dozens of websites are not updating.
Since December, labour unions representing journalists have been protesting salary and job cuts, demanding new collective labour agreements, which haven't been updated since 2009.

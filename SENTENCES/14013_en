BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece and Austria are reportedly spearheading an EU effort to persuade Turkey to stop blocking the participation of Cyprus in international talks on important issues.
According to a report in the EU Observer Monday (14 November), EU diplomats are warning Ankara that its refusal to recognise the Greek Cypriot state hampers strategic co-operation between the EU and NATO.

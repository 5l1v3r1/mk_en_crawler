SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts said on Thursday (September 25th) they exhumed 360 bodies -- victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre -- from a mass grave near the eastern village of Kamenica.
Experts said the site is a secondary grave:
the killers transported bodies there to hide any traces of the crime.
This is the tenth such grave found along the road from Srebrenica to Kamenica, an area now known as "Death Valley".
Authorities have exhumed about 3,370 bodies so far from the other nine graves.

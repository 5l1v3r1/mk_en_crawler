WASHINGTON, United States -- Lawmakers are discussing President George W Bush's $75 billion wartime budget, which includes assistance to other countries affected by the war in Iraq. 
On Tuesday (1 April), the proposal received important endorsements from the House and Senate Appropriation Committees. 
Their members agreed with the president that Turkey should receive $1 billion in grants. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell will deliver the news personally during meetings in Ankara on Wednesday.
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told lawmakers on Tuesday that his government is prepared to launch a new initiative for the reunification of Cyprus following the February failure of a UN plan. 
He said he would discuss the issue with Greek leaders at a regional conference in Belgrade next week. 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was to announce specifics Thursday during a visit with leaders of the Turkish Cypriot government. 
He had to cancel those plans and will fly instead to Brussels, for an unexpected meeting of NATO foreign ministers.

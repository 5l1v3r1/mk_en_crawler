PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi admitted on Tuesday (January 27th) that he is concerned about the latest developments in the new Kosovo Security Force (KSF). 
Three high-ranking KSF officers resigned recently over the process used to hire staff. 
Separately Tuesday, KSF Defence Minister Fehmi Mujota called for a review of the process. 
"There have been technical failures, and there are cases where some people have damaged the process," Mujota said. 
Members of the outgoing Kosovo Protection Corps whom the KSF rejected protested last week, citing irregularities in the process. 
They met with President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Tuesday to discuss the matter.
The leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj, criticised the government Tuesday for delays in establishing security mechanisms. 
He cited the KSF as one example, along with the Kosovo Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council.
In other news, EULEX said its judges and prosecutors have taken over 1,250 files from their Kosovo colleagues, media reported on Wednesday. 
Proceedings in cases involving organised crime, murders and corruption have already begun.
Meanwhile, EULEX Commander Yves De Kermabon visited the Serb-dominated town of Strpce on Tuesday and said a single police chain of command benefits all communities. 
He noted there is a strong sense of commitment in the multi-ethnic police force.

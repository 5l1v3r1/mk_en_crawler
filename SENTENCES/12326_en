SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU Police Mission (EUPM) in BiH and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic issued separate responses Wednesday (11 May) to Republika Srpska Police Chief Dragomir Andan's claim that the perpetrators of the March 2004 train attacks in Madrid might have trained in BiH. 
Andan said intelligence information suggested that foreign Islamic fighters who participated in the BiH conflict were linked to subsequent international terrorism. 
The EUPM expressed surprise at Andan's statement, noting that it expected Andan to come forward immediately with credible information about such issues instead of making it public at a news conference. 
Separately, Terzic demanded that the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office launch a probe into Andan's allegations.

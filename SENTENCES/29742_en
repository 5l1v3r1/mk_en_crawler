BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) proposed on Tuesday (May 24th) the introduction of a safeguard clause that would allow for the temporary reintroduction of visas for citizens of a third country.
EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a press conference that the mechanism would be applied under certain exceptional conditions and as a last resort, adding this does not target any specific country.
The EC will continue dialogue with Serbia and Macedonia over the influx of asylum seekers in EU member states.
The EC proposal will be discussed by EU interior ministers next month.

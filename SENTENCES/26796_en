ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament will be dissolved on Monday (September 7th), following the decision last week by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to call for snap elections on October 4th. 
Karamanlis said he needed a new mandate to help lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
Speaking at a press conference Sunday to mark the beginning of his campaign, he warned that there are two hard, but inevitable years of restrictions ahead. 
"Yes, we have overcome the worst part of the crisis, but it is time to face our structural weaknesses," Karamanlis said in Thessaloniki. 
He noted that the crisis in Greece has not been as serious as in some other countries, but pointed out that the country must address its huge public debt, accumulated over the past 30 years.

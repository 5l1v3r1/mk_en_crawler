PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Moderate Serb political leader Oliver Ivanovic on Monday (24 April) praised Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu for visiting a monastery on Easter day.
"Deeds speak more than words," Ivanovic said.
Sejdiu visited the Decani monastery near Pec Sunday, meeting with Serbian Christian Orthodox Bishop Teodosije.
Prime Minister Agim Ceku, meanwhile, visited two villages near Pec to donate two tractors to Serb farmers.
His request to attend Easter celebrations at the Dusanica monastery was turned down by Serb clerics.
In other news, Ceku reiterated on Monday that Pristina does not recognise the 2001 agreement on interstate border demarcation sealed between Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro, as regards the border section with Kosovo.
Ceku was talking to reporters after a meeting in Pristina with Arben Xhaferri, leader of the Macedonian opposition Democratic Party of Albanians.

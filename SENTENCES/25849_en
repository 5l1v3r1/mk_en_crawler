ANKARA, Turkey -- Improving ties between Turkey and Israel is linked to the end of the humanitarian tragedy in the Gaza Strip, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Friday (October 16th).
"Unfortunately, the Gaza offensive dealt a big blow to peace efforts" in the Middle East, Davutoglu told journalists.
"When there is a return to the track of peace, these relations of trust (with Israel) will be re-established on the same level as before," he added.
Last week, Turkey postponed routine military exercises because Israel intended to send aircraft that may have been used in operations against Gaza last December.

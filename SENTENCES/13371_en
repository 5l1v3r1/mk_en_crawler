BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- European Commission (EC) Ambassador to BiH Michael Humphreys again urged Republika Srpska (RS) on Tuesday (25 October) to fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
During talks in Banja Luka with RS leaders, Humphreys stressed that BiH would otherwise be unable to complete talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
In other news Tuesday, RS President Dragan Cavic said two candidates are being considered for the post of BiH's chief negotiator with the EU.

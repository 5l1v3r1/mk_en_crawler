BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer reiterated the Alliance's support Friday (June 15th) for the fast adoption of a new UN Security Council resolution based on UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan. 
Speaking at the end of a two-day informal meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels, he said this would ensure the sustained economic and political development of the province, as well as regional stability. 
He also stressed that KFOR would respond firmly to any provocation.
NATO's South Wing Commander, US Admiral Harry Ulrich, delivered a similar message Friday during a visit to Belgrade. 
He assured officials that KFOR is committed to protecting the Serb population and the Serbian cultural and historical heritage in Kosovo.

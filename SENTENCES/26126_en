SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Tuesday (October 13th) that some of the US-EU ideas for changes to BiH's constitution are unacceptable to his entity. 
His comment followed three hours of discussions in Banja Luka with experts from Washington and Brussels. 
Among the proposals, he mentioned changes to the role of the House of Peoples and to the composition of BiH's tripartite presidency. 
The Bosnian Serb leader said RS demands that the constitution include the right of the entities to hold a referendum on their status. 
The expert teams arrived in Sarajevo on Monday to prepare for the next round of talks with party leaders aimed at breaking the longstanding political stalemate in BiH. 
The first round was held Friday at Camp Butmir, near Sarajevo. 
Leaders of seven Muslim, Croat and Serb parties attended, along with senior EU and US officials.

TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE insists it complete its full mandate in Albania, despite talk by the government of limiting it. 
On Tuesday (August 5th), local media published a letter OSCE Chairman-in-Office Alexander Stubb sent to Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha, confirming the OSCE wants to fulfil its mandate in co-operation with Albanian authorities. 
Sources close to the OSCE said the government had asked that the mission be limited to providing assistance in electoral reform, good governance and judicial reforms.

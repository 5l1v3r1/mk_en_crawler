SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, Erhard Busek, reiterated in Skopje on Sunday (23 April) that there is no alternative to admitting Western Balkan states to the EU. 
Busek was in Macedonia at the weekend, attending the NGO Alpbach forum. 
Speaking to local media, he also touched on the issue of price hikes for Schengen visas, suggesting that improved security would lead to an easing of visa regimes. 
The proposed increases have drawn criticism around the Balkans.

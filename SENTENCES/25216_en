ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors on Wednesday (January 27th) filed charges against 17 people as part of the ongoing investigation into the so-called Ergenekon organisation. 
The group is suspected of planning a coup against the government of the ruling Justice and Development Party. 
The latest charges stem from a cache of weapons found in Istanbul last April. 
Prosecutors are reportedly seeking life sentences for five of the suspects -- two lieutenant-colonels, two majors and a retired major. 
Local media reported Thursday that the 300-page indictment has been accepted by a civil court in Istanbul. 
However, a recent ruling by the Constitutional Court overturned a law allowing military personnel to be prosecuted in civil courts. 
More than 200 people have been arrested since the Ergenekon investigation began two and a half years ago.

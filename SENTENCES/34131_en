BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament adopted an amendment Wednesday (16 July) to a law proposed by the cabinet concerning the National Bank of Serbia. 
It would require the central bank governor to have no party affiliation. 
The current governor, Mladjan Dinkic, would have to step down under the proposed legislation, since he is also deputy head of G17 Plus. 
Dinkic says the government is trying to kick him out, and has accused officials of corruption. 
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic denies those allegations.
In other news, the OSCE says it is disappointed that parliament approved three members of Serbia's Broadcasting Council without disclosing information about them to the public. 
The Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia also criticised the move, which took place earlier this week.
Also Wednesday, the foreign ministers of Serbia-Montenegro and Macedonia met in Belgrade to discuss bilateral co-operation. 
Goran Svilanovic and Ilinka Mitreva agreed that there are no outstanding issues.

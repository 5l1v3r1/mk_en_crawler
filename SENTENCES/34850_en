SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said on Friday (1 August) that Bulgaria and Macedonia are ready to view their common history in a new, modern and European way. 
His remarks were part of a speech marking the anniversary of the 1903 Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising, aimed at liberating areas that remained under Ottoman rule following the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War. 
Parvanov added that Bulgaria would follow the path of EU-oriented relations in its dealings with Macedonia and said that their common histories, a source of division in the past, could contribute to regional stability and security in the future.

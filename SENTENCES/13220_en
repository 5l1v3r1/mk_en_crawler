SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (22 February) to send a new military unit to Iraq. 
Some 120 troops and about 30 support staff will be dispatched in a non-combatant role -- guard duties at the Al-Ashraf refugee camp. 
The decision marks Bulgaria's return to the international coalition in Iraq, following a December troop withdrawal.

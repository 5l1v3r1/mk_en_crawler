TIRANA, Albania -- The government coalition led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha faced Thursday (May 3rd) two developments that may lead to no confidence votes in Parliament. 
Lawmaker Gilman Bakalli resigned from the ruling Democratic Party (DP), citing the failure to improve living conditions in his town of Shkodra since Berisha's government came to power. 
Subsequently, the head of the Christian Democratic Party (PDK) caucus, Nikolle Lesi, said he will oppose all laws proposed by Berisha's government because the DP has failed to respect an agreement signed with the PDK regarding the February local elections.

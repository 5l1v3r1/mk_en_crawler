PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci will not sit behind a "UNMIK/Kosovo" tag at a regional EU-Western Balkans conference, later this month in Slovenia. 
Their offices confirmed on Tuesday (March 2nd) that the two officials will go to Slovenia only if they are invited as equals to counterparts from other countries. 
Citing sources in Brussels, Serbian media had reported that Kosovo will not be represented as a state at the conference, but as a region that continues to be under UNMIK's administration.

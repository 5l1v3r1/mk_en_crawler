BELGRADE, Serbia -- Slobodan Milosevic's widow, Mirjana Markovic, and his son, Marko, will be charged with smuggling cigarettes, Serbia's special prosecutor for organised crime said on Monday (June 11th).
Slobodan Radovanovic said the family established a crime group to profit from the international embargo against Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
The total value of the cigarettes is estimated at tens of millions of euros.
Proceeds from their sale were allegedly transferred to offshore firms.
International arrest warrants have been requested, as both suspects are believed to be hiding in Russia.
Radovanovic says authorities have detained several other people in relation to the case Monday.

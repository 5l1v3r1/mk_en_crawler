SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Teachers continued their strike for the ninth day Wednesday (October 3rd) with street protests across the country. 
They are demanding a 100% salary increase and more spending on education in the state budget. 
Their trade unions invited Education Minister Daniel Valchev to a meeting in Sofia on Tuesday, but he declined the invitation. 
President Georgi Parvanov plans to meet with teachers' unions on Thursday in a bid to mediate the matter.

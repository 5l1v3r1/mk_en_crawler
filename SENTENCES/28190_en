BUCHAREST, Romania -- The two largest opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party, are planning to launch a vote of no confidence against the government within the next two weeks. 
Party leaders announced on Monday (April 19th) that the main issue is the cabinet's series of severe spending cuts, necessitated by the recession.

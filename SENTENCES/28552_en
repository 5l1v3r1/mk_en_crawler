BUCHAREST, Romania -- Civil servants in Bucharest gathered for a spontaneous demonstration outside the finance ministry on Wednesday (October 13th) to protest wage cuts.
About 100 people joined the rally, insisting they should not be deprived of bonuses that amount to as much as 25% of their pay.
The bonuses were slashed as part of the government's austerity measures undertaken in line with bailout loans from the IMF last year.
Finance Ministry Tax Manager Sorin Blejan came out and called for calm but the protest continued.
Workers in more than a dozen cities across Romania staged spontaneous protests of their own after seeing the Bucharest rally live on television.

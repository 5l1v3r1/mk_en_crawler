NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis said Monday (February 11th) that Cyprus will never recognise Kosovo and that other EU countries agree with that stance. 
On Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov compared the crisis in Kosovo to the international isolation of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
Ivanov, participating in a security conference in Munich, said there are similarities between the two issues and warned EU representatives at the forum that if they recognise Kosovo, they will have to recognise Northern Cyprus as well.

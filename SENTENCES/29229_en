NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu held a meeting Wednesday (August 4th) as part of the ongoing talks to reunify the divided island. 
The leaders continued discussions on the property issue aimed at resolving numerous complex claims on property seized decades ago. 
The officials are set to meet again next week. 
"The fact that these meetings are taking place between the leaders and at the Representatives' level so many times in August is a very positive sign," Lisa Buttenheim, the Special Representative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said after the meeting. 
Buttenheim was appointed to the post last month, succeeding Taye-Brook Zerihoun. 
She will also serve as the head of the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The agreement on the Prevlaka peninsula reached five years ago benefits both Croatia and Montenegro and should not be changed, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said on Sunday (December 9th), marking the 5th anniversary of the signing. 
"The agreement is an important signal from the Balkans that the two countries have managed to reach a temporary agreement on a very sensitive issue," Vujanovic told the Dan newspaper. 
The Prevlaka peninsula in the Adriatic Sea is located 45km southeast of Dubrovnik. 
It controls access to that country's naval base at the Kotor Inlet. 
The agreement obliges the two countries to demilitarise the peninsula and to establish common naval patrols.

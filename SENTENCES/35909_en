ATHENS, Greece -- Police and soldiers will be deployed to protect the Olympic sites in Athens during the coming weeks, a local newspaper reported Sunday (18 January), citing a secret document.
According to the newspaper, hundreds of personnel will be assigned to 35 facilities that are considered possible terrorist targets.
The operation is expected to continue until the Games open in August.
In other news, a government measure to curb soccer violence backfired at a match Sunday when fans of AEK Athens and Ionikos Athens fought each other and the police.
The government had banned fans from attending their teams' away games.
To avoid the ban, hundreds of AEK fans entered the Ionikos stadium without wearing their trademark club attire, brawling with the home crowd almost immediately.
Late Saturday meanwhile, Greek Coast Guard units detained a ship flying the North Korean flag when they discovered 77 illegal immigrants, mostly from Egypt, who were about to disembark in southern Greece.
The Georgian captain and four Ukrainian sailors were arrested.

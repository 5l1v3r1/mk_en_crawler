SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged EU member states Wednesday (May 7th) to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH as soon as possible.
At a news conference in Sarajevo, Lajcak said delaying the signing from late April to late May to allow for translation of the documents -- while proceeding with the signing of an SAA with Serbia -- had angered the public.
Belgrade, he noted, has not met all the commitments required by the EU, chief among them war crimes co-operation.
Last week, media reports surfaced that the May 26th signing date is also questionable.

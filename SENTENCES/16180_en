ZAGREB, Croatia -- The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) are at odds over the appointment of four members of the state news agency HINA's management board.
According to local media reports Friday (14 July), SDP accuses HDZ of political interference in the media's work, saying that these appointments -- approved by parliament Thursday -- were not in line with legal and professional standards.
HDZ insists the appointments were in full compliance with the law and that the four nominees meet all competency requirements.

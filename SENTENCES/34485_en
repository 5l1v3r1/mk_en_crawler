YEREVAN, Armenia -- Bulgaria, Armenia and Georgia signed a multilateral transport agreement on Friday (10 October).
The signing ceremony took place at the end of the 3rd annual conference of the TRACECA intergovernmental commission.
TRACECA is an EU project aimed at creating a transport corridor connecting Europe to Central Asia via the Black Sea, the South Caucasus and the Caspian.
Armenian Transport Minister Andranik Manukyan said the combined transport accord was designed to direct passenger and cargo traffic by rail, sea and road through the three signatory countries.
He added they would serve as a link between Europe and Iran and Afghanistan, which expressed willingness to join the project as well.
On Saturday, Bulgarian Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov met with Cypriot Minister of Justice and Public Order Doros Theodorou.
The talks took place within the framework of the 25th Conference of European Ministers of Justice held in Sofia, and focused on opportunities for co-operation in the fight against terrorism and crime.
The two ministers agreed on the necessity of signing a bilateral agreement stipulating joint efforts against terrorism and organised crime, illegal migration, financial fraud, and human and drug trafficking.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia's membership in the EU will be conditioned on resolving its disagreements with Kosovo, Wolfgang Ischinger, former EU envoy for Kosovo's status, said on Monday (January 11th). 
In an interview with the BBC, Ischinger emphasised that Pristina and Belgrade must start discussions to find what he described as a "practical way" to live together without raising any fundamental issues. 
Ischniger noted that Germans faced the same situation in the 1960s and 1970s. 
"In the long term, Serbia and Kosovo will also join the EU, and at that moment all discussions on who owns which territory will be much more irrelevant than today," Ischinger added.

DUBLIN, Ireland -- The Irish referendum Saturday (19 October) supported the EU enlargement process and bolstered Bulgaria and Romania's hopes of joining the Union in 2007. 
The vote paves the way for the entry of ten countries in 2004 - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. 
Bulgaria and Romania are expected to enter the Union three years later, assuming they complete the required economic and political reforms. 
EC President Romano Prodi expressed satisfaction with the results of the referendum, as some 63 per cent of the voters backed EU enlargement. 
"We are closer to our goal but are not there yet," he noted.

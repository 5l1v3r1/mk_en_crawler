ATHENS, Greece -- A home-made bomb exploded on Friday (November 13th) outside the Athens home of parliament member Mimis Androulakis, of the ruling PASOK party. 
No injuries and only minor damage was reported. 
An anonymous caller tipped police shortly before the blast. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday meanwhile, police arrested three people in connection with a series of attacks organised by a leftist group. 
Two men and a woman, all of them around 20 years old, were detained in Athens for alleged involvement with the Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei organisation. 
Police are looking for six other suspected members.

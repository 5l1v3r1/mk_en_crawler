SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown issued a decree freezing all budget payments to the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the Office of the High Representative (OHR) said Saturday (3 April). 
The OHR said the ban was the result of the party's "failure to completely meet its obligations towards the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia". 
Ashdown said there is reason to believe party funds were being channelled to wartime leader Radovan Karadzic to help him evade justice. 
The statement added the measures would remain in place until SDS takes actions that demonstrate a readiness to meet its responsibilities. 
The OHR added that eight years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the people of BiH -- especially those of Republika Srpska -- remain "hostages" of political forces that have not met their key obligation: bringing war crimes suspects to justice.

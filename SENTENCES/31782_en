SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Minister of Regional Development and Public Affairs Georgi Georgiev resigned Tuesday (7 January), citing "Bulgaria's inconsistent position" on implementation of a number of regional infrastructure projects. 
Among them were the Bourgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline and the Gorna Arda hydropower project. 
In an interview with bTV, Georgiev also accused the regional development ministry of a lack of clarity, consistency and priorities in its work, as well as a lack of will to implement parliamentary decisions.

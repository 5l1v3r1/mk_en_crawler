BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police reported on Tuesday (December 19th) that they have tightened security around Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, following rumours of an impending assassination attempt. 
Local media reports claim Serbia's Zemun Clan organised crime gang has issued a contract for the murder. 
The same group is accused of killing Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in March 2003.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- A Swedish court on Monday (December 18th) found a former mercenary guilty of committing war crimes while he served as a member of a Croat militia in the early 1990s.
Jackie Arklov was found guilty of the wrongful imprisonment, torture and assault of 11 Bosnian Muslim prisoners of war and civilians.
According to the court, the crimes also included ethnic cleansing, looting, and arbitrary detention of people protected by international law.
Arklov is already serving a life sentence for the 1999 murder of two Swedish police officers.

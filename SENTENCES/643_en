The Serbian government is withdrawing the operating license of the telcom Mobtel and placing its operations under the control of the state-run Telekom Serbija, on the grounds that it contracted a mobile operator to carry out services in Kosovo without a required permit. 
The Austrian consortium of investors that owns a 51 per cent stake in Mobtel announced it will appeal the decision. 
The firm is already mired in a conflict over ownership, with the state claiming it should own a 58 per cent stake instead of a minority 49 per cent share.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The parliament of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) rejected on Friday (October 2nd) a measure that would have slashed veterans' benefits, even though it is required under the terms of budget-cutting plan reached with the IMF and the World Bank.
Several hundred war veterans had gathered outside parliament for a second day Friday, to protest the proposed 10% reduction in benefits and the reversal of a law that grants special privileges to decorated veterans.
They also demanded the resignation of FBiH Minister for Veteran Issues Zahid Crnkic.
Parliament convened an emergency meeting after some protestors destroyed part of an iron fence that was built to separate them from the parliament building.
FBiH's Prime Minister Mustafa Mujezinovic slammed the parliament's decision as "illegal", saying it violates the 1 billion euro stand-by arrangement with the IMF.
"I think it is better to protect the interests of 2.3 million people in the Federation, than to give in to demands of one group," he added.

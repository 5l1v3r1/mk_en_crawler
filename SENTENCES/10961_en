ZAGREB, Croatia -- After months of steep decline, support for EU entry has started to rise this month, according to a new poll published Friday (29 April) in Vecernji List. 
The survey, by the Metron Vectura agency, found 49.8 per cent of respondents said they would support EU entry in a referendum, compared to 47.8 per cent at the end of March and a record low of 43.8 per cent in the middle of March. 
That is when the EU decided to postpone scheduled accession talks over the failure to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. 
The newspaper suggests support is now rising amid hopes surrounding a new EU assessment task force.

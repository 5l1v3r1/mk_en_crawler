STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) approved in the first reading Thursday (October 12th) a resolution giving one-time financial assistance to Kosovo, in the amount of 50m euros.
The funds would help cover budget deficits in 2006 and 2007 and help local authorities retain macroeconomic stability.
Also Thursday, the news agency BTA reported that the EP will vote on Bulgaria and Romania's accession to the EU in December.
In late November, the EP Foreign Affairs Committee will review the latest reports related to the countries' future membership.

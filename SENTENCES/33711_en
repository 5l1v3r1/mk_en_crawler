SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Wednesday (3 September), the State Census Commission called for the establishment of a working group to monitor the processing of the 2002 national census data at the Statistical Bureau.
The initiative came in response to recent media allegations of non-transparency at the bureau, as well as some speculative statements by bureau representatives about the country's ethnic composition (MIA - 03/09/03)

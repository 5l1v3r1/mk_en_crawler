ATHENS, Greece -- The Foreign Ministry has summoned Dora Grosomanidou, the country's ambassador to Macedonia, to clarify comments attributed to her that appeared in Friday's (July 6th) edition of the Financial Times.
"Greece has to face the new reality, as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has been recognised under its constitutional name (Macedonia) by more than half of the members of the UN," Grosomanidou was quoted as saying.
Local media in Athens say she gave the interview without asking the Greek government for permission.

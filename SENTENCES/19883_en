BELGRADE, Serbia -- The upcoming negotiations over the future status of Kosovo provide the last chance for an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plasnik said on Monday (August 20th).
"We have already lost too much time and we need transparency," Plasnik told the daily Wirtschaftsblatt.
She also said she hopes Moscow realises that blocking policy within the UN Security Council would not result in a settlement.
The international troika and the Contact Group must present their conclusions to the UN secretary general by December 10th.
Meanwhile, Marko Jaksic, leader of the Serb National Council of Northern Kosovo and a member of Belgrade's negotiating team, told Glas javnosti on Sunday that the United States holds the key to a solution.
He urged Washington to "exert its influence on the Albanians to agree to negotiate".

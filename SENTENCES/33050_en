ATHENS, Greece -- In an interview published Sunday (22 June) in the Greek newspaper <I>To Vima</I>, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would complete reforms suggested by the EU by the end of this year, in the hope this would open the way for the start of accession talks with the Union at the end of 2004. 
Erdogan cited broad political support for the accession process, but acknowledged a small minority opposed it for various reasons. 
He said his country does not want special treatment, but insists on being treated fairly like all other candidates. 
He also praised the role of Greece, which has held the rotating EU presidency for the past several months, in advancing Turkey's membership bid.

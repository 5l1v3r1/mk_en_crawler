SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Thursday (15 May), the Army's General Staff met with President Boris Trajkovski, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and Interior Minister Hari Kostov to brief them on the security situation in the country, progress made in army and defence sector reforms and implementation of the 2002-2003 action plan for NATO membership. 
The general staff said the security situation is stable and improving, adding that after the EU's six-month monitoring mission ends, Macedonia would be able to handle its own security.
Meanwhile, a Macedonian peacekeeping unit headed to Romania Thursday to take part in an international military drill. 
It continues until 15 July.

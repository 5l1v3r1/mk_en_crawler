THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague said Friday (16 July) it has indicted Goran Hadzic, 46, with 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including persecution, extermination, torture and wanton destruction. 
Hadzic, a central figure in the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina from 1992 to 1993, has also been charged with responsibility for the deportation of 20,000 people from the town of Vukovar following its capture by Serb troops. 
He reportedly now lives in the Serbian city of Novi Sad. 
The Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Ministry said it received the indictment and sent it to a Belgrade court.

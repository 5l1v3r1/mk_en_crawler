BELGRADE, Serbia -- Ratko Mladic, the world's most wanted war criminal, hid in Belgrade between 1 June 2002 and 25 January 2006, local media reported Thursday (20 July), quoting a sealed indictment of ten people accused of helping the fugitive.
According to prosecutors, the alleged accomplices -- mostly Bosnian Serbs who were close to Mladic during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict -- rented apartments for him, drove him between hideouts and provided food.
Also Thursday, Serbia's government approved the action plan for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
It envisages stepped-up activities for the location and arrest of Mladic.

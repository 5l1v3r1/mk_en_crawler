SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council Steering Board ambassadors urged BiH politicians Tuesday (March 13th) to respect the Dayton Peace Agreement, which outlines the institutions of BiH, the entities and the municipalities. 
The statement followed a meeting in Srebrenica, where Bosniak political leaders demanded the town be given the status of a district, outside of Republika Srpska's jurisdiction. 
The Bosniaks say they cannot stay in an entity created as a result of genocide.

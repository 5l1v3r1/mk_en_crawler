THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- A report by an independent expert has confirmed the authenticity of Ratko Mladic's diaries, media reported on Wednesday (January 12th). 
The document was drafted by Slovenian graphologist Dorian Kerzan at the request of The Hague war crimes tribunal for use in the trial of Vojislav Seselj. 
Kerzan compared authenticated samples of the former Bosnian Serb military leader's handwriting with that in the diaries. 
Serbian police found them during a February 2010 search of the Belgrade apartment of Mladic's wife. 
Hague prosecutors want to use the diaries as evidence in several trials, including that of Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party. 
He is charged with committing war crimes against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

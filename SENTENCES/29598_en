NEW YORK, United States -- More than 500 Croats gathered on Wednesday (April 27th) in front of UN headquarters in New York to protest the war crimes sentences handed down to Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac.
The UN war crimes tribunal convicted the two on April 15th of charges stemming from the 1995 military operation Storm.
Gotovina was sentenced to 24 years and Markac got 18.
The court found that they had participated in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at forcibly and permanently removing the ethnic Serb population from the Krajina region of Croatia.

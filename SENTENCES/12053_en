BUCHAREST, Romania -- President-elect Traian Basescu said Wednesday (15 December) that failure by his Justice and Truth Alliance to form a coalition cabinet could lead to early elections. 
He ruled out the possibility of a deal with the Social Democrats (PSD), arguing that such an arrangement would bring instability to Romania. 
The PSD, meanwhile, continued its efforts to persuade two small parties to join them in a future ruling coalition. 
There were plans to sign an agreement on Wednesday, but these were cancelled when the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania said it wanted also to continue consultations with the Justice and Truth Alliance.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Thursday (November 6th) described as correct the European Commission's (EC) new progress report on Kosovo.
It criticises institutions for their inability to fight organised crime and corruption.
Thaci said that he personally expressed these concerns earlier this year and blames the judicial system.
The government said it will begin developing a series of strategies:
one to combat organised crime, another to fight terrorism and a third to fight drug trafficking, along with necessary action plans.
The opposition party Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) also weighed in on Thursday, saying the EC's report provides a clear picture of the current situation in Kosovo.
The AAK urged state institutions to take the findings seriously.
In other news Thursday, the American Chamber of Commerce in Kosovo published an investigative report on corruption and businesses there.
According to the document, about 66% of businesses admit they had to bribe employees of institutions and officials in order to run their business.
The most problematic institutions cited are the power company KEK, various government agencies -- including customs and the tax administration -- and the courts.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The entity symbols of Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH (FBiH) were abolished as of Friday (June 15th), in line with a decision by the BiH Court earlier this year. 
The Court ruled that the RS anthem and coat-of-arms, as well as the FBiH coat-of-arms and flag, were non-compliant with the BiH Constitution, as they do not represent all three constituent peoples -- Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats. 
The removal of these symbols from the buildings of entity institutions is under way.
In other news, leaders of BiH political parties met on Saturday to discuss crucial constitutional reforms, under the auspices of the Office of the High Representative in Sarajevo. 
However, the heads of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH -- Sulejman Tihic and Dragan Covic, respectively -- did not attend.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN envoy Alvaro de Soto warned the people of Cyprus on Tuesday (6 April) that the referenda on 24 April would be the island's last chance at reunification for a long time. 
"The plan will be null and void if it isn't approved at referenda," he said in response to speculation that the UN will renew its mediatory efforts after six months if the proposal is rejected. 
He urged the Turkish and Greek communities to familiarise themselves with the latest version of the UN plan, saying it offers a "principled compromise" which addresses the concerns of both ethnic groups. 
Current polls show that the plan may be rejected by the Greek community but narrowly adopted by Turkish Cypriots.

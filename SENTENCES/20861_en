SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague said on Wednesday (September 5th) that it will hold a special evidentiary hearing in Sarajevo as part of the trial against former BiH Army General Rasim Delic.
The hearing, scheduled to begin on Friday, will be the first held outside The Hague courtroom.
Prosecutors want the judges to hear from former Mujaheedin fighter Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad, also known as Ubejda, who is serving a prison sentence in BiH for involvement in a Mostar car bombing.
Delic is charged with the rape, torture and murder of Bosnian Croats and Serbs committed by troops under his control.
In other news Wednesday, the State Investigation and Protection Agency searched the offices of the Kalinovik police department, confiscating a number of documents related to the 1992-1995 conflict.
Last week, Republika Srpska police arrested two people for suspected involvement in war crimes committed in that area.

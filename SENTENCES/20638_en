SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities say Swedish Embassy and KFOR personnel were involved in a scheme to smuggle out five residents of Kosovo. 
The five were allegedly driven across the border in jeeps used by the Swedish contingent in KFOR on Saturday (October 6th). 
They allegedly had passports issued illegally by the Swedish Embassy in Skopje. 
Plans to board a flight to Stockholm were thwarted when border police officials noticed they lacked stamps proving they entered Macedonia. 
Officials say they entered the country through an auxiliary border check point in Blace, regularly used by KFOR.
The Swedish government says it is investigating circumstances surrounding the incident.

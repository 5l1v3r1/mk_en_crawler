NICOSIA, Cyprus -- There is a historic chance to resolve the Cypriot issue, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told a press conference Thursday (June 25th), as he wrapped up a daylong visit to Nicosia. 
"We [the EU] will not find a solution, but we can help and support efforts to find one," Barroso said, after meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias. 
During his visit to the divided island, Barroso also met with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. 
Barroso said he had urged both Christofias and Talat to open another crossing between the two parts of the island.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The ambassadors of the EU member-states finally agreed Monday (19 September) on the text of the statement on Turkey's refusal to recognise Cyprus. 
The EU will allow Ankara to delay its formal recognition of Cyprus until its accession, which could take ten years or more. 
The Union will set a deadline, however, for Turkey to open up its ports and airspace to Cypriot ships and planes. 
The draft declaration also includes a warning that failure to give Cypriot businesses access to the Turkish market will delay Ankara's accession. 
The EU foreign ministers are expected to formally approve the text of the statement Tuesday. 
The deal seems to remove the last hurdle to the launch of accession talks with Turkey on 3 October.

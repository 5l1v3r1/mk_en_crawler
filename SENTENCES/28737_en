PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government will deliver its answers to additional questions on the EC questionnaire Monday (April 12th). 
Montenegrin authorities received 673 extra questions in early March. 
The first set of answers was submitted in December 2009. 
Based on all the responses, the EU will assess Podgorica's readiness for membership. 
Montenegro hopes to obtain candidate status by the end of this year and launch accession talks early in 2011. 
EP rapporteur for Montenegro Charles Tannock said he expects the country to obtain an EU candidate status this year.

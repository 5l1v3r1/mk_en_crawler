Leb i Sol, the most famous band in the former Yugoslavia, launched a regional tour with a concert in Bitola, Macedonia.
Over 3,000 people gathered to watch virtuoso guitarist Vlatko Stefanovski and his bandmates -- Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Dimusevski (keyboards) and Garo Tavitijan (drums) -- play 25 of their greatest hits.
Founded in the 1970s, Leb I Sol was known for its combination of rock, jazz-fusion and ethnic music.
They won numerous awards at musical festivals in the 1970s and 1980s and were repeatedly chosen as best group of the year.

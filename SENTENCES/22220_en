NEW YORK, United States -- Matthew Nimetz, the UN mediator in the Greece-Macedonia name dispute, acknowledged at a news conference Thursday (June 12th) that talks earlier in the day yielded no progress between the two sides. 
Describing the two-hour closed-door meeting at a UN Security Council chamber, he said, "We didn't solve the problem here ... 
but we'll get back to work after visiting the region." Greece's NET TV said Nimetz will visit Athens and Skopje at the end of the month.

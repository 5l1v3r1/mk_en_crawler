THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The last president of federal Yugoslavia took the stand in The Hague on Tuesday (18 November) to describe Slobodan Milosevic as an autocratic ruler whose only preoccupation was to remain in power.
Borisav Jovic, the Yugoslav head of state in 1990-1991, also described to the UN war crimes tribunal how the former Serbian president played up nationalist feelings among his fellow countrymen and manipulated other leaders.
"Over time, he transformed his political personality from a normal politician ...
to an absolutist who more or less did not consult anyone and did not listen to anyone," Jovic said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey would never abandon its bid to join the EU, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told parliament on Thursday (December 21st).
He criticised, however, the EU's decision to freeze the opening of eight accession chapters with Turkey, saying the move demonstrates "lack of vision in the EU", given Turkey's stabilising role.
The EU move was in response to Ankara's failure to open its ports and airports to traffic from Cyprus, as promised under a customs protocol.
In other news, local newspapers Friday continued to speculate about whether Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan may run for president next year.
Milliyet said he has decided to do some polling before making a final decision.

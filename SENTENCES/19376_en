PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK deputy chief Stephen Schook said on Wednesday (September 26th) that he has been told of a UN Internal Oversight Office probe into his behaviour.
"According to the information I've managed to gather, the probe pertains to my alleged aggressive behaviour, unprofessionalism and close relationships with Energy Minister Ethem Ceku and former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, and extends to personal relationships I supposedly had with some women from Kosovo and those working with the UNMIK mission," he said at a press conference in Pristina.
Schook denied that he was guilty of anything other than loving his job and being fully committed to it.
"My 'guilt' may as well stretch to the fact that I have respected people I've worked with, including Haradinaj while occupying the post of prime minister," he said.
"I respected his conduct when The Hague tribunal issued an indictment against him since I supported the organisation of elections in Kosovo at the time." He said he has no plans to resign.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian government announced Friday (16 July) that it has adopted a package of anti-mafia legislation, as well as related amendments to the country's penal code. 
The adopted measures provide for the freezing of assets from organised crime, and prohibit officials convicted of corruption from holding public office for a specified period of time.
Also on Friday, an association representing victims of political persecution called on President Alfred Moisiu not to approve a law on compensation recently passed by parliament. 
The controversial law was adopted by deputies of the ruling Socialist Party after opposition MPs left the parliamentary session.

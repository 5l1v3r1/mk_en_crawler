NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders met in New York on Friday (September 28th) for a round of talks on the future of the Serbian province and agreed to hold further negotiations in Brussels on October 14th. 
Otherwise, no significant breakthrough was achieved, although international officials attending the session described it as "constructive" and "co-operative". 
Both sides essentially repeated the positions they have held since the latest negotiating effort began in August, with the Pristina delegation insisting that independence is non-negotiable, and the Serbs offering "sustainable and substantial autonomy".
In other news, Serbian Minister of Energy Aleksandar Popovic walked out of a regional conference in Athens on Friday when the chairman of the event allowed an ethnic Albanian delegate from Kosovo to make a statement. 
About 20 Serbian representatives of various institutions and commercial companies also walked out. 
Popovic said he would ask his government to leave the so-called Energy Community between the EU and the countries of Southeastern Europe if it does not receive assurances that Friday's incident would not be repeated.

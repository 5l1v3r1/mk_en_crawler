THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic refused to co-operate with his two court-appointed British lawyers Tuesday (7 September) and demanded their removal.
It was lawyer Steven Kay, however, who questioned the first witness for the defence, former law Professor Smilja Avramov.
She once taught law to the defendant and served as an adviser to the Serbian government in the 1990s.
Avramov, 85, testified that Milosevic and the Bosnian Serb leaders had no plans to carry out ethnic cleansing in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
Under the new rules for the trial, Milosevic was invited to question the witness after the lawyer had finished, but refused.

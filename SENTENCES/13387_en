SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said Wednesday (29 March) that he would discuss the issue of decertified police officers when he visits UN headquarters in New York next month.
His comments followed talks with BiH Human Rights Minister Mirsad Kebo and representatives of the association of BiH police members, who were denied certification by the former UN International Police Task Force (IPTF) in BiH.
The association has been staging a series of protests, claiming that human rights were not fully observed in almost 200 cases during the IPTF certification process, conducted from 1996 to 2002.
Schwarz-Schilling says he agrees the issue deserves review.

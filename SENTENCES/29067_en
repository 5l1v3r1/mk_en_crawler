BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbian President Boris Tadic and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton agreed on Tuesday (September 7th) to continue dialogue aimed at harmonising Belgrade's and Brussels' stances regarding Serbia's draft resolution on Kosovo.
No further details were announced after the meeting in Brussels.
The document submitted by Belgrade denounces Kosovo's independence and calls for fresh talks with Pristina.
It will be discussed by the UN General Assembly on Thursday.
Meanwhile, International Civilian Representative in Pristina Pieter Feith said on Tuesday that future talks between Kosovo and Serbia will exclude the issue of status.
"Kosovo's status has been solved;
that is a fait accompli, and there is no reason for the idea for new negotiations," Feith told journalists after a meeting with Local Government Minister Sadri Ferati, who reiterated the government's position that Kosovo and Serbia can talk only as two equal states.

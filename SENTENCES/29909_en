WASHINGTON, United States -- Romania and Bulgaria will register the highest economic growth among the EU's ten ex-communist members, the World Bank said in a report on new members published Tuesday (April 19th). 
Two and a half years after the start of the global economic crisis, economic activity in the EU10 is recovering in parallel with that of the EU15, the so-called old members of the bloc. 
The Bank says the pace of economic recovery in the EU10 will accelerate this year and next. 
Romania is expected to be the leader in 2012 with an economic growth of 4.4%, according to Catalin Pauna, World Bank economist and co-author of the report. 
In Bulgaria, the World Bank expects economic growth of 3.4% in 2012.

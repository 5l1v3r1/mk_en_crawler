ATHENS, Greece -- The ministry of public order announced Sunday (22 June) that it is preparing a plan to remove all beggars from the streets and neighbourhoods of the five major Olympic sites:
Athens, Thessaloniki, Volos, Patras and Crete.
The ministry, together with the ministry of health and welfare, is already organising facilities for taking in panhandlers.
The ministry estimated that there are currently 700 child beggars in the centres, but expressed concern that no one could force them to stay there.
In other news, Greek Defence Minister Yannos Papantoniou left Sunday on a six-day visit to Russia, where he will discuss opportunities for bilateral military co-operation, EU-Russia relations, and NATO-Russia relations.

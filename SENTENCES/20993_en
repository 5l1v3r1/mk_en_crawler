BRUSSELS, Belguim -- The European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee approved a visa facilitation agreement Wednesday (October 3rd) with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro.
The accord will significantly relieve visa issuance procedures for certain categories of citizens, such as businessmen, journalists, academics, students, members of official delegations as well as family members and relatives of citizens who are legal residents in EU countries.
The document is expected to come into force in January 2008.

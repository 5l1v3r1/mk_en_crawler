PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government allocated 100,000 euros Monday (January 5th) for owners of property torched during weekend ethnic unrest in northern Mitrovica. 
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said the measure is aimed at prompting the owners to reopen for business. 
Welcoming the move, Alliance for the Future of Kosovo leader Ramush Haradinaj urged the government to strengthen the police presence in the Serb-dominated north to prevent future incidents between Albanians and Serbs. 
He wants to open permanent police substations there.

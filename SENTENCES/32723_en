SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Greek Deputy Defence Minister Lazaros Lotidis arrived on a three-day visit to BiH Saturday (14 December). 
Following talks with his Federation of BiH counterpart, Mijo Anic, in Sarajevo, Lotidis stressed that his country was prepared to continue assisting with reforms in the country's military sector. 
He reiterated that the establishment of defence structures at a state level in BiH is the main pre-condition for admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
A new bilateral agreement on military co-operation will be signed between BiH and Greece in January.

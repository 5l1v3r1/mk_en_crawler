PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Thirty-three top students from the state university in Podgorica became the first to receive Montenegrin passports, two years after the country split from a former federation with Serbia. 
The new documents replaced the Yugoslav passports which Montenegrins had been carrying since the mid-1990s. 
According to Interior Minister Jusuf Kalamperovic, they are an important condition for joining the Schengen White List, which allows for visa-free travel.

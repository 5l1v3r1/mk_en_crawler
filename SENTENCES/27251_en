NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou on Monday (March 1st) rejected any notion of holding an international meeting based on the formula "three plus two" to discuss reunification of the divided island.
Ankara proposed the idea last month, suggesting a conference involving Great Britain, Greece and Turkey, along with representatives of the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
"We do not agree with the organisation of any meetings that would undermine the status of the Republic of Cyprus as a sovereign state," Kyprianou said.
Britain, Turkey and Greece are guarantors for Cyprus' independence, territorial integrity and security under the 1960 agreement on independence.
In other news Monday, Erato Kozakou Marcoullis and Demetris Eliades were appointed as the new ministers -- respectively -- of communications;
and agriculture, natural resources and environment.
The pair replaced Nicos Nicolaides and Michalis Polynikis who resigned after their party, the Movement for Social Democracy (KS-EDEK), decided to withdraw from the ruling coalition in February.
The KS-EDEK has accused President Demetris Christofias of making concessions to Turkish Cypriots during ongoing reunification talks.

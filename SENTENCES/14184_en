COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The UN envoy for Kosovo status talks, former Finnish President Marti Ahtissari, said Saturday (12 November) that the United States should retain its presence in Kosovo. 
The US contribution to KFOR "is essential in order to provide a visible expression of continued engagement", he said. 
He also urged NATO to remain committed to Kosovo, saying no other organisation "can currently provide the same basis of stability". 
Ahtissari was speaking one day after the UN Security Council approved his nomination as envoy. 
He is due to begin a two-week tour of the Balkans on 21 November, with stops in Belgrade, Pristina, Podgorica, Tirana and Skopje.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Changes to the Lisbon Treaty will not slow down Croatia's EU accession, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Saturday (October 30th), adding that her government expects to close all negotiations chapters in the spring of 2011, during the Hungarian presidency of the bloc. 
The EU member states decided on Friday to set up a permanent mechanism to stabilise the eurozone by bringing some "limited" amendments to the Lisbon Treaty by 2013. 
Kosor said that in her talks with EU member-state prime ministers, she has been reassured that Croatia will wrap up its accession talks in 2011 and proceed normally towards full-fledged membership.

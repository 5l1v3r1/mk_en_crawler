STRASBOURG, France -- Despite a period of turbulent transition, Serbia is moving forward and making progress on its road to EU integration, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) concluded on Tuesday (April 28th).
In a resolution, the PACE urged Serbia to draft a road map envisioning concrete steps to reform its democratic institutions, particularly parliament, to raise the level of human rights protection and to strengthen the rule of law.
According to the resolution, opposition parties in Serbia should adopt a constructive approach in parliament, while the majority should commit to meaningful dialogue with the opposition.

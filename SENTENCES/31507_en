ATHENS, Greece -- Three men have been arrested in connection with a traffic accident last week that killed 21 children and injured 24 others. 
Judiciary officials reported Sunday (20 April) that the driver and the two owners of a truck that hit a school bus on the road between Athens and Thessaloniki have been charged with murder. 
The accident occurred when logs became dislodged from the truck, which then ran into the bus. 
The truck driver allegedly failed to tie down the load properly. 
Six loaders have been charged with complicity to commit murder.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country will provide a relief package worth $150m to regions of Pakistan devastated by the earthquake that struck earlier this month.
Erdogan arrived in Islamabad on Thursday (20 October) for talks with Pakistani counterpart Shaukat Aziz.
Erdogan travels on Friday to the devastated areas, accompanied by construction and housing experts from Turkey who will help in the long term with reconstruction.
The UN has issued an urgent appeal for additional aid, with winter looming for 3.3 million people made homeless by the quake.
Early Friday, a strong earthquake rocked the Turkish city of Izmir.
One person died of a heart attack and at least 15 others were injured jumping from buildings.

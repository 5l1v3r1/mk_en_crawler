PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Serbian Orthodox Church's Bishop Filaret has been banned from entering Montenegro, Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic said on Monday (July 30th). 
He cited a list provided by chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, which includes Filaret among those helping war crimes indictees escape justice. 
Montenegro is seeking to comply with del Ponte's request that countries in the region help apprehend fugitive indictees, Sturanovic said.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Spiric held an emergency session of the Council of Ministers on Monday (December 3rd) to adopt an action plan to pave the way for implementation of the Mostar declaration on police reforms.
This would enable the initialling of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU on Tuesday, since establishing an independent state-level police has been a key condition imposed by the EU.
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is expected in Sarajevo on Monday to meet with leaders and gauge whether sufficient consensus on police reform exists to initial the SAA.
In a Friday statement, Rehn welcomed the adoption of a new rulebook for the BiH parliament, saying it would lead towards the normalisation of the political situation.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government and the International Civilian Office (ICO) are intensifying efforts to create a new municipality in northern Kosovo, the Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore reported on Friday (January 22nd). 
Establishing a municipality in Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica is viewed as bringing that part of Kosovo under the country's constitution, rather than Belgrade's control. 
Senior international officials told the newspaper that the ICO -- on both sides of the Ibar River -- is in contact with communities about the long planned new municipality. 
But Oliver Ivanovic, State Secretary of the Serbian Ministry for Kosovo, said those efforts will fail. 
"Mitrovica is not Gracanica. 
We have our own institutions and we will continue to have them," Ivanovic was quoted as saying, confirming Belgrade's support for Serb parallel institutions in Kosovo.

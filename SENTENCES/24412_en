THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Appeals Council at The Hague war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (April 8th) ordered the temporary release of former Kosovo Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports Astrit Haraqija. 
The time he spent behind bars awaiting trial equalled the five-month sentence he received for contempt of court. 
The tribunal convicted Haraqija in December of attempting to talk a prosecution witness out of testifying against former Kosovo Albanian military leader Ramush Haradinaj.

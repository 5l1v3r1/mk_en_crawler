ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament is set to vote Monday (March 31st) on a controversial bill aimed at reforming the country's pension system. 
The plans have triggered a wave of nationwide protests over fears that reforms would cut pension benefits and raise the retirement age. 
The vote was initially scheduled for last Wednesday, but was delayed by a no-confidence motion against the government that was defeated on Saturday.
Opposition parties now plan to submit a proposal to hold a referendum on pension reform. 
The proposal would require the approval of at least three-fifths, or 180, lawmakers. 
The ruling New Democracy party holds 152 seats in parliament.

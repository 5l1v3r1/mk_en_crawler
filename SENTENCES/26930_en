BELGRADE, Serbia -- Switzerland will grant 40m euros over the next three years to support Serbia's EU integration effort, Swiss Ambassador to Belgrade Erwin Hofer said on Monday (March 8th). 
In outlining Switzerland's 2010-2013 strategy for co-operation with Serbia, Hofer pointed out that the priority is for Belgrade to prepare to join the EU. 
The funds will be allocated to programmes aimed at improving economic competitiveness and the social inclusion of minority and marginalised groups.

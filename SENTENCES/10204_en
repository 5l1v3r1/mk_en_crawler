BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso told reporters Monday (29 November) that Bulgaria and Romania would probably be invited to seal the EU accession treaty in April or May 2005. 
His comments followed a meeting with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov in Brussels. 
Barroso reiterated that the two countries would join the Union together, dismissing recent rumours that they might be separated due to delays in Romania's accession negotiations.
Also Monday, Luxembourg assured Bulgaria that it supports efforts to sign the accession treaty as early as possible next year. 
Luxembourg is next in line to assume the rotating EU presidency.

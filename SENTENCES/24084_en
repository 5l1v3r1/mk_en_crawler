PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs living in Kosovo have not welcomed the news of visa liberalisation for Serbia, because it specifically excludes them, local media reported on Thursday (July 16th).
European Commission officials said on Wednesday that they would propose the inclusion of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro in the so-called White Schengen List, but said that Serbs living in Kosovo will not be included in the process.
Many Serbs living in the former Serbian province, especially younger people, say they feel betrayed by Belgrade.
"It is not good that Serbs from Kosovo are not allowed to have equal rights," a resident of Gracanica said.

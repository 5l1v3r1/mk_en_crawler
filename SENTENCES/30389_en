ATHENS, Greece -- The police announced on Friday (January 14th) they have arrested five people suspected of links to a terror group. 
Four of them were detained Thursday, while the fifth, a German woman, was detained Friday. 
The arrests were made after authorities seized weapons, ammunition and computer hard drives from suspected safe houses of the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire in Athens.
The group is believed responsible for several attacks, including a blast in front of a courthouse in Athens last month and a series of parcel bombs that were sent to embassies across Europe. 
A trial against over a dozen of its suspected members is opening in Athens on Monday. 
The police said Saturday that during the raids they have found evidence that the group was planning terror attacks ahead of the trial opening.

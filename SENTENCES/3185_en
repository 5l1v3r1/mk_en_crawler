The longstanding rumours about the entry of a new company into the Serbian telecommunications market have been confirmed. 
Last week, the Serbian Agency for Telecommunications published a tender for a third mobile operator, with a starting price of 320m euros.
Austria's Mobilkom is the sole candidate to have acquired tender documentation. 
The firm participated in an earlier tender for another mobile phone operator, but lost out to Norway's Telenor.
The decision on who will get the license will be announced by November 15th.
A company may participate in the tender for the third license if it offers a price higher than the starting price, if it already has more than a half a million users and its profits last year exceeded 500m euros.
The existing operators, Telenor and Serbian Telekom, cannot participate in this tender for the license, which will be issued for a period of ten years and can later be renewed for another decade.
"If interested parties assess that they have good investment conditions here, that there is no corruption and that competition is possible, then the price would be better. 
And, vice versa, a lower price may be expected if investors have weaker confidence in our market," says foreign investment consultant Milan Kovacevic.
The tender will be a major Greenfield investment, says the chairman of the Management Board of the Republic Telecommunication Agency, Jovan Radunovic.
Serbia today has an estimated four and a half million mobile phone users, and this amount is expected to increase. 
Introducing a new competitor into the market has the potential to benefit consumers by offering them more choices and lower prices, advocates say.
Telenor, the buyer of Mobi 63, says it anticipated the third license tender, and that the growing Serbian market is big enough to accommodate other mobile operators.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's government said Friday (26 November) it provisionally closed two more negotiation chapters -- Environment and Other -- in its accession talks with the EU, during a session in Brussels on Friday (26 November). 
At Bucharest's request, the Taxation chapter was re-opened and closed the same day. 
According to the government, Romania was granted transition periods for Environment and Taxation. 
Agreements regarding the Other chapter include 500m euros of assistance for the period 2007-2009, mainly for border upgrades. 
Talks on the remaining two chapters -- Competition and Justice and Home Affairs -- reportedly could be held on 8 December, allowing the negotiation process to be finished before the Union's mid-December summit.

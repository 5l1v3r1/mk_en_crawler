SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new leader of the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, Prime Minister-designate Vlado Buckovski, meets on Friday (3 December) with the leader of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, Nikola Gruevski. 
The two politicians are expected to discuss the country's strategic interests and goals, and ways to overcome differences. 
Similar meetings between leading figures of the ruling and the opposition parties took place last year, but failed to produce results.
In other news, Buckovski's predecessor, former Prime Minister Hari Kostov, presented information on four cases of alleged corruption to the Public Prosecutor's Office on Thursday. 
Kostov resigned from his post last month, citing corruption and other issues.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted on Thursday (May 3rd) to hold parliamentary elections on July 22nd, rather than in November. 
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) called for an early vote after the Constitutional Court annulled last Friday's attempt by Parliament to elect Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as president of the republic. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the court's decision on Wednesday, saying Parliament would never be able to elect a president again. 
His party says it will try to amend the constitution so that the president would be elected by the people instead.
Meanwhile, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has welcomed the call for early general elections. 
He stressed that both parliamentary and presidential voting should be conducted "democratically", "in an atmosphere of responsible debate and political stability", and "without any undue interference". 
In particular, the military should not interfere in domestic politics, Rehn said, noting that civilian control over the armed forces is a core EU value.

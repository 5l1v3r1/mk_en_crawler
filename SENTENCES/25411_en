NEW YORK, United States -- High Representative Valentin Inzko told the UN Security Council on Monday (November 23rd) that progress in BiH is being blocked because of unresolved political differences.
He blamed "some Serb political figures" for the obstruction, which has resulted in the delay of key reforms, including those related to abolishing EU visas for Bosnian citizens.
"Republika Srpska has created a problem at the state level and then criticised the state for having the problem," Inzko said while presenting a report on the work of the Office of the High Representative from May 1st to October 31st.

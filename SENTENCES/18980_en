BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Party (PD) made a second attempt on Friday (June 1st) to file a no confidence against Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's minority government cabinet, but the bid was again rejected by the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Bogdan Olteanu. 
A Liberal parliamentarian, Mihail Lupoi, reportedly withdrew his signature from the document, leaving it one short of the required 116.
The PD, the party of President Traian Basescu, says it has not given up and will continue related activities this week.

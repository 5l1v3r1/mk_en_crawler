SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Greater interethnic tolerance is crucial to the successful implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord, according to foreign experts participating in a workshop Friday (2 April) in Skopje. 
They stressed that peace building should begin in school, in order to overcome past separation and emphasise the importance of unity to the country's development.
Meanwhile, on the campaign trail Sunday, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski vowed to continue the late President Boris Trajkovski's efforts towards speedy Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Crvenkovski, of the ruling Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, hopes to succeed Trajkovski in the early presidential election, 14 April. 
The other candidates are Sasko Kedev of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE, Gim Ostreni of the Democratic Union for Integration and Zudi Xhelili of the Democratic Party of Albanians.

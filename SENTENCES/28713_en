PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo and Serbia have the same expectations about the UN General Assembly meeting in September, both believing member states will vote in their favour.
State Secretary in Serbia's Ministry for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic said on Wednesday (August 11th) that there is plenty of time to secure support before the General Assembly session.
The majority of states will stick to their foreign policy positions, he said.
Kosovo Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Vlora Citaku said Pristina's institutions are co-ordinating their work with international partners to make the session another successful day for Kosovo and its statehood.

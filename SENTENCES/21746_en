SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik threatened on Monday (November 24th) to file criminal charges against Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian and the international prosecutors working in BiH's state court because of a recent probe into RS government finances. 
Dodik became furious after prosecutors asked him to submit all documents and contracts related to the construction of a new government building in Banja Luka, a project worth 110m euros. 
Dodik refused to comply, insisting state courts have no jurisdiction over RS and accusing Gregorian of organising a plot against his government. 
Dodik also accused the prosecutors and judges of anti-Serb bias.
In other news Monday, police in Croatia announced the arrest of two Bosnian nationals for alleged possession of 81,400 euros in counterfeit banknotes that they were trying to "sell" to undercover officers. 
Their arrests Saturday in the Adriatic town of Solin capped a four-month-long investigation.

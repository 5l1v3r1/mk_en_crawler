SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) parliament's House of Representatives passed amendments Wednesday (February 24th) to the law on war veterans, a key condition for the release of the next tranche of a 1.2 billion-euro stand-by arrangement with the IMF and additional funding by the World Bank and the European Commission. 
The bill aims to reduce spending on war veterans and their families and to introduce a census, to determine how many people truly need state aid. 
The lawmakers also approved a law on public sector salaries that stipulates wages could be cut later in the year if revenue targets are missed. 
Parliament's upper house is to debate the measures Thursday.

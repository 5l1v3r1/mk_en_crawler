SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko insisted on Thursday (June 25th) that there is no alternative to dialogue among the three constituent peoples in the country.
He was meeting with Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats and Dragan Covic of the Croat Democratic Union of BiH.
Missing from the talks was Bosniak Party of Democratic Action head Sulejman Tihic, who refused to participate given what he called Dodik's increasingly secessionist rhetoric.
Inzko initiated the session to urge BiH leaders to fully engage in meeting the remaining objectives set by the Peace Implementation Council for closing down his Office of the High Representative.
He also stressed the international community's support for the so-called Prud process, as a forum for political dialogue to resolve important political issues.
After the talks, Covic said he will organise a meeting Sunday in Mostar of the eight largest parties in BiH, to discuss ways to accelerate implementation of the EU reform agenda.

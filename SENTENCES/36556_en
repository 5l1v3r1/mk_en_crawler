THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic's doctors said Wednesday (4 August) that his poor health would prevent him from adequately representing himself during the defence portion of his trial before The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
The physicians have recommended that Milosevic turn his defence over to a lawyer, a move he has adamantly rejected in the past. 
The trial is set to resume on 31 August.

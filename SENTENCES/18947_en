LIBERTYVILLE, United States -- Serbia's last king, Peter II, may be reburied in his own country, 37 years after his death.
Serbian Crown Prince Alexander said he was planning to move his father's remains from the Chicago area to Serbia, since communists are no longer in power.
Peter II is believed to be the only monarch buried in the United States.

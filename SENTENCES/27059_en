PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief prosecutor Theo Jacobs announced on Tuesday (November 3rd) that in the next two months, senior officials involved in illegal affairs will be arrested.
"I know that my people are working on a number of cases.
I cannot say anything else ...
[but] we'll see how successful the investigations will be," Jacobs said during a round table organised by the Kosovo Democratic Institute (KDI).
A source was quoted by the media as saying that cabinet ministers and political party leaders are among those under investigation.
The KDI presented a report concluding that corruption is spreading within the justice system.
Kosovo's chief prosecutor, Hilmi Zhitija, acknowledged there are around 50 judges and prosecutors being investigated.

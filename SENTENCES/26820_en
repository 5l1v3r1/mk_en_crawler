SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- British Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged BiH's political leaders Friday (November 6th) to follow through with institutional reform proposed by the United States and the EU, saying it is of key importance to the country's Euro-Atlantic future.
"These are important times when [BiH] leaders are going to be making important choices that will affect the European and NATO membership aspirations of their country," Miliband said after a series of meetings with political officials in Sarajevo.
"I very much hope that all the leaders will continue to engage positively with the Butmir process because I think that it offers a very important chance for Bosnia to make forward progress."
The so-called "Butmir talks" between senior EU and US officials and leaders of the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties started in the beginning of October with the purpose of ending the lengthy political stalemate and moving the country towards EU and NATO accession.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- An international prosecutor has charged four former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas, including prominent commander Rustem Mustafa, with war crimes.
They face 11 counts including illegal detention, inhumane treatment, torture of illegally detained people and murder, UN spokeswoman Izabella Karlowicz said Thursday (21 November).
The victims were ethnic Albanians suspected of collaborating with Serbian authorities in the province.
Mustafa's arrest in August sparked protests in his native Podujevo.
Still unclear is whether the UN war crimes tribunal will pick up the case.
Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has said she expects to open the first case against former KLA members by year's end.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov formally announced the start of his re-election campaign Friday (25 August), vowing to lead rather than be led by political interests.
Candidates have until 16 September to register, ahead of the 22 October election.
On Thursday, the ministry of state administration and administrative reform projected the election would cost a record 11m euros, up from 5m euros in 2001.

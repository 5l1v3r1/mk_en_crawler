SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The parliaments in Skopje and Pristina ratified an agreement Saturday (October 17th) on the demarcation of the border between the two countries. 
The document resolves an eight-year dispute over the region, used by Albanian guerrillas in 2001to launch attacks during Macedonia's rebel Albanian insurgency. 
The deal followed months of talks under the auspices of the EU and the United States. 
The document was supported by 83 members of Kosovo's 120-seat parliament, and by 72 members of Macedonia's 120-seat parliament. 
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski hailed the move as "a great success for Macedonia, because we are closing the border issue that for years nobody could solve".

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Lawmakers passed a measure Thursday (September 10th) on public servants that aims to make public administration more efficient and professional.
This was the last in a series of three laws aimed at accelerating the country's EU integration process.
The other two were on financing political parties and on parliament.

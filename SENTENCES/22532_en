BUCHAREST, Romania -- The union representing Romania's judges submitted a written complaint after parliament's lower house rejected a proposed investigation of former senior officials, media reported on Tuesday (September 9th). 
In August, lawmakers opposed a request by graft prosecutors to investigate former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea. 
The union said parliament's judicial committee had analysed all evidence before the vote and recommended that lawmakers reject the investigation. 
That, says the judges, compromised the vote.

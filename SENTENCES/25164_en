PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon wants to serve another mandate.
In an interview Tuesday (March 30th) with public broadcaster RTK, he said he would like to serve another two years after his current mandate expires in June.
De Kermabon reiterated that EULEX is in Kosovo to help local institutions strengthen the rule of law, but described the current fight against corruption as "weak".

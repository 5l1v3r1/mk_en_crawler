SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has turned to two lobbying companies from the UK and Canada in a bid to re-open the third and fourth reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear plant, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Wednesday (January 16th). 
Stanishev said every effort will be made to make the two units operational again, given the increasing demand for electricity in the region. 
One idea is to offer the management of the two units to foreign companies in an effort to convince the European Commission to re-open the units. 
In 1999, Bulgaria agreed to close four of its older nuclear reactors as part of a condition to start accession negotiations with the EU.

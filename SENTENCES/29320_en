BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the two biggest parties in Republika Srpska (RS), have agreed on a platform for joint action at the state level.
The agreement was reached Wednesday (November 3rd) between Milorad Dodik of the SNSD and SDS's Milan Bosic.
The move establishes a Serbian bloc in the BiH parliament, where the two parties will hold 12 of the 42 seats.
Under the joint platform, the parties will reject constitutional changes that will undermine the authority of RS or mechanisms to defend its interests.
The two parties will also work to close the Office of the High Representative and other forms of international administration in BiH.
The SDS will remain in opposition in the RS parliament despite joining forces with the SNSD at the state level.
The SNSD will instead partner again with the Democratic People's Alliance and the Socialist Party.
The SNSD will hold 37 of the 83 seats in parliament, but will secure a majority with its coalition partners.

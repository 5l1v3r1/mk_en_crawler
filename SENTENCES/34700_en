BUCHAREST, Romania -- One elderly man died and 11 other people were hospitalised after being bitten by spiders along Romania's Black Sea coast. 
Medical authorities in Constanta say the bites cause headaches, dizziness and muscular spasms. 
The exact species of the spider is unknown, but it appeared during the ongoing heat wave.

TIRANA, Albania -- The 2010 draft budget envisions a steady economic growth of 5.3%, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Tuesday (October 27th). 
He added that the deficit is not expected to grow and that plans are in the works to boost salaries and pensions. 
He also unveiled capital investment plans, including the building of 7,000km of roads during his four-year mandate
But the IMF office in Tirana criticised the "euphoria" surrounding the draft budget, describing ambitious talk of incomes increasing by 15% as "unrealistic". 
"Albania needs realistic expenditure programmes in order to avoid a crisis," said Gerwin Bell, head of the IMF office in Tirana.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney has suggested that the US will likely increase pressure on BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska (RS), to stop blocking police reform.
In an interview published by Nezavisne novine on Saturday (24 September), McElhaney said BiH needed an efficient and modern police and that Washington strongly supported everything being done by the EU in this regard.
The consequences of the current police reform stalemate, he warned, were that BiH would remain far from EU membership while Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro advanced on their path toward the Union.
Responding to RS claims that it has a new proposal for reaching a deal in line with EU principles, McElhaney said that he was looking forward to seeing the new ideas and hoped they would be better than what has been witnessed so far.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Thursday (August 6th) the country has made little progress in meeting the five conditions and two objectives required for closing down his Office of the High Representative (OHR). 
Inzko met in Korcula with Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency. 
Bildt reiterated the EU's strong commitment to eventual membership for Western Balkan countries and said Brussels will be watching reforms in BiH, especially efforts to meet the conditions for visa liberalisation.

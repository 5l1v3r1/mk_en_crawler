RIJEKA, Croatia -- The Croatian Supreme Court on Thursday (24 June) affirmed the verdicts returned against three war crimes indictees -- Tihomir Oreskovic, Stjepan Grandic and Mirko Norac.
In late March, the Rijeka court sentenced Oreskovic to 15 years in prison, Norac to 12 years and Grandic to 10 years.
The court acquitted Ivica Rozic of war crimes charges.
Prosecutors then sought stiffer sentences and the annulment of Rozic's acquittal, while the defendants sought reduced sentences.
The trial, which began in 2002, is seen as a test of the Croatian judiciary, ahead of the possible transfer of Hague cases to domestic courts.

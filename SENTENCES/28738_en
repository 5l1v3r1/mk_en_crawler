TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha urged his cabinet Monday (October 11th) to organise a public information campaign on the benefits and restrictions of pending EU visa liberalisation.
During a meeting with lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party, Berisha said he wants all methods of advertising used.
Visa liberalisation enables Albanian citizens to travel without visas in the Schengen zone, but only for a 90-day period, without being able to ask for a residency permit or work, Berisha pointed out.
The government wants to avoid a scenario similar to that in Macedonia and Serbia, whose citizens travelled to Europe and then asked for asylum after being included in the Schengen zone last December.
Following last week's decision by the European Parliament to support the lifting of visas for citizens of Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is now up to the Council of the EU to give final approval next month.
Albanians are expected to travel without visas by the end of the year.

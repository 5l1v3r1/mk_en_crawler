HELSINKI, Finland -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Wednesday (February 23rd) that his country is committed to repaying the loans it has received from European countries as part of a 110 billion-euro bailout package to revive the country's economy. 
"I can guarantee that we will repay the debt," Papandreou said after a meeting with Finnish Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi in Helsinki. 
He arrived there from Berlin as part of a European tour aimed at gathering support for Greece's position ahead of next month's summit of European leaders in Brussels. 
Athens hopes to be able to extend the repayment period of its bailout package and agree on lower interest rates.

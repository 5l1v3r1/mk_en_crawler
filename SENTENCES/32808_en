ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia joined the free trade zone in Central Europe on Thursday (5 December) by signing an accession agreement with the other members of the group. 
Officials in Zagreb hope that easier access to the markets of the Central European Free Trade Agreement - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia - will help revive the Croatian economy. 
Zagreb's membership is expected to start early March after it has been ratified by the parliaments of all member states.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic predicted on Tuesday (April 3rd) that there would be enough political support in Parliament to adopt the proposed new constitution, avoiding a costly national referendum on the issue. 
Vujanovic says a referendum would be a waste of time and money, and that any failure by politicians to reach consensus would raise questions about Montenegro's reform and integration processes. 
On Monday, lawmakers endorsed the draft and forwarded it to the public for debate, before final parliamentary approval.

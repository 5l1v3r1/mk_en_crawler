ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Chief of General Staff Yasar Buyukanit vowed on Monday (October 8th) to continue the fight against terrorism and militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and to intensify operations.
At an extraordinary meeting at the presidential palace, the three officials discussed PKK attacks against Turkish troops that have claimed at least 15 lives since the weekend.
Local media reports Tuesday suggest Tuesday a cross-border military operation into northern Iraq was among the options discussed.
Turkey and Iraq recently signed an anti-terror co-operation agreement aimed at tackling the PKK militants in northern Iraq, but the deal stops short of allowing forces to enter Iraqi territory.

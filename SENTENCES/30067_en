PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Foreign Policy Club (FPC) published the results of a poll Wednesday (December 22nd) gauging public reactions to various governing coalition scenarios, following the December 12th general elections. 
It found, for example, that supporters of the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) would reject forming a coalition with the election-winning Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). 
The AAK finished fourth in the elections but seems crucial to establishing a strong cabinet led by the PDK. 
Another possible PDK coalition partner would be the New Kosovo Alliance. 
The survey suggests joining a PDK coalition would be okay, but forming one with the second-place finisher -- the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- would be better. 
The survey also found that the public would oppose another coalition between the PDK and the LDK. 
The Pristina-based FCP conducted the poll before the elections.

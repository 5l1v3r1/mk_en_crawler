NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat failed to reach an agreement Thursday (May 21st) on opening a new crossing on the border between the Turkish and Greek parts of the island. 
"Some problems remained, and we were unable to settle the issue," Talat told reporters after his 29th round of direct reunification talks with Christofias.
Christofias accused Talat of making unacceptable demands, such as allowing fuel to pass through Turkish Cypriot territory to a Turkish military outpost. 
He explained both the Greek and the Turkish sides back the opening of a new crossing point, but added Turkish Cypriots' "greedy" demands ruined chances for an agreement. 
Last year, both officials made a commitment to open a new crossing in the village of Limnitis to facilitate free movement.
During a visit to Ankara on Thursday, Turkish Cypriot Foreign Minister Huseyin Ozgurgun questioned whether the Greek Cypriots regard Turkish Cypriots as an equal party in the talks or whether they are willing to resolve the Cyprus issue. 
During a joint press conference with Ozgurgun, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called for speeding up the reunification talks and rejected any attempt to link the issue to Ankara's EU membership bid.

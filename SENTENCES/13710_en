THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Thursday (20 October) filed a formal appeal of a decision by the war crimes tribunal to allow former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj to participate in politics. 
The former KLA commander was granted provisional release following his voluntary surrender to the court. 
Del Ponte argued that the judges' decision has given too much power of discretion to UNMIK, which has been authorised to approve Haradinaj's political actions. 
At the same time, the prosecutor contended, the tribunal has not taken into account objections and concerns by victims and potential witnesses.
In other news, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Andrei Denisov said in an interview published Friday that his country believes the time is right for the UN to consider the question of Kosovo's final status. 
The Security Council decides the issue next week.

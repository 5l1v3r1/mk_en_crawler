ANKARA, Turkey -- Three men, identified as a father and his two sons, opened fire on their neighbours in the village of Karaali in eastern Turkey on Tuesday (July 21st), killing six people and injuring seven others, media reported. 
The assailants, Hasim Yukselen and his sons, raided the home of Yukselen's brother, Mehmet, shot and killed his wife, and left him for dead. 
Later, the attackers walked through the village firing shotguns randomly at villagers, said local Governor Muammer Musma. 
The gunmen fled after the attack. 
Musma said all three have "psychological problems", and had previously threatened village residents.
In other news, a soldier was killed in a landmine blast in the southeastern province of Sirnak, the General Staff said in a statement Tuesday. 
The mine, allegedly planted by members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), exploded as troops patrolled a mountainous area on Mount Kupeli, between the towns of Sirnak and Cizre.
Meanwhile, excavations began on Tuesday at a suspected mass grave inside an army compound in the southeastern province of Hakkari. 
Prosecutors ordered the excavation, after receiving a tip that 12 Kurds missing since 1994 might have been executed and buried there. 
The Kurds belonged to the so-called village guard, a local militia paid by the government to support the army in its fight against the PKK.

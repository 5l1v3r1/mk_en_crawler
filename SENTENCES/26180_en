TIRANA, Albania -- European Parliament (EP) Vice-President Roberta Angelilli on Saturday urged the opposition Socialist Party (SP) to stop its parliamentary boycott and start co-operating with the government. 
SP lawmakers have been boycotting the work of parliament since September, insisting they will not return unless a thorough investigation is conducted into the June 2009 general elections, which they insist were manipulated. 
Angelilli said the EP has adopted a resolution recognising Albania's progress in efforts to improve its elections with legislative and administrative reforms. 
She further noted that international monitors in the June 2009 vote did not report any irregularities in the election process. 
The statement came hours after the first meeting between SP leader Edi Rama and Prime Minister Sali Berisha at President Bamir Topi's office.

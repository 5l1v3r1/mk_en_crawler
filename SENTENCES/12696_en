SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of the five former Yugoslav states continued negotiations Tuesday (5 May) in Skopje on the distribution of assets from the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY). 
Previously, they agreed on how to divide the NBY monetary gold. 
Now the Committee for the Distribution of Financial Assets and Liabilities is working on the distribution of NBY's deposits abroad, which reportedly amount to some $220m. 
In 1991, the successor countries of the old Yugoslav federation signed an agreement under which Croatia is entitled to 23 per cent of the funds, Slovenia to 16 per cent, Bosnia and Herzegovina to 15.5 per cent, Macedonia to 7.5 per cent, and Serbia-Montenegro to 38 per cent.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), a junior partner in Bulgaria's ruling coalition, will back incumbent President Georgi Parvanov for a second term in elections this autumn, MRF's deputy leader Yordan Tsonev told bTV on Monday (10 July).
He says there is no reason why the MRF and voters should not trust Parvanov, of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

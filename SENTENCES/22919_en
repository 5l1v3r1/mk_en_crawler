PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Slovenian President Danilo Turk said Ljubljana respects Montenegro's stance on Kosovo and has no intention of pressuring Podgorica into recognising Kosovo's independence, media reported on Wednesday (September 3rd).
"Our foreign policy's principle has never been to exert pressure," Turk told reporters after meeting with Montenegrin counterpart Filip Vujanovic in Podgorica on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha met with Kosovo counterpart Skender Hyseni on Wednesday and assured him that Albania has made available all its diplomatic and state resources to help Kosovo gain international recognition.
So far, 46 countries have recognised the country, a "satisfying number" said Hyseni.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A Serb accused of war crimes in Kosovo was remanded on Thursday (August 13th) to 30 days in custody by a court in Prizren.
Goran Vuckovic, 33, from the village of Goroselo, was arrested on Tuesday based on suspicions that in 1998 and 1999 he committed war crimes in Kosovo.
Investigators say he was a member of a paramilitary group and a key figure in the destruction of the historic Prizren League house, which was later restored and now functions as a museum.

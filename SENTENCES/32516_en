ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Tuesday (11 March), Defence Minister Zeljka Antunovic refuted speculation by the media about the deployment of US troops at local bases. 
She explained that the government decision to supply logistical support for possible US raids in Iraq referred only to civilian staff. 
By law, parliament is the only institution that can authorise deployment of foreign military units.

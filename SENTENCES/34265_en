ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament debated draft changes to the labour law on Tuesday (1 July), while trade unions protested in front of the building.
The unions oppose proposed amendments that would reduce severance pay and change dismissal procedures.
Opposition members in parliament have also rejected the draft changes, saying the government has pressured unions and employers to accept them.
Labour and Welfare Minister Davorko Vidovic, however, said that 17 meetings have been held to reconcile differences.
In other news Tuesday, the Karlovac county court sentenced Croatian Serb Miljan Strunjas to 12 years in prison for war crimes against Croatian civilians in the autumn of 1991.
He was first sentenced to a 12-year term in February, but the trial was repeated at the request of the Croatian Supreme Court.

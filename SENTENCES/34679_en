SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A man who threatened to kill the Pope during his recent visit to Croatia has been sentenced to six months in jail. 
Investigators found no evidence that Almir Abdulah, 23, actually intended to assassinate the pontiff. 
He admitted to sending threatening e-mails to Croatian media that he signed on behalf of the "el Mudjehedin Islamic Front". 
Local media reported he did it to enhance his image among local computer hackers.

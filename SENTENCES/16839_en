BUCHAREST, Romania -- After heated debate, the Conservative Party's Bogdan Pascu was appointed as new deputy prime minister Wednesday (5 July), succeeding George Copos.
The latter stepped down a few weeks ago, after his proposals for cutting taxes for small business were excluded from the government's new fiscal code.
Also Wednesday, President Traian Basescu acted as chairman of a cabinet session, invoking his constitutional power to participate in ministers' meetings dedicated to issues of national interest.
His office say Basescu again warned against delays in EU accession reforms and called for stepped up efforts in decentralising healthcare, education and agriculture.
Meanwhile, local press reports suggest tension within the ruling coalition persists.
On Wednesday, parliament decided to postpone until the autumn a debate on the draft law on national minorities.
That angered the ethnic Hungarian UDMR, a junior government partner, which insisted that the bill be discussed during the current session of the legislature.
UDMR initially threatened to boycott sessions but eventually decided to stay.

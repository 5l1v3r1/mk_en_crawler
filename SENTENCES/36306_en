ANKARA, Turkey -- US President George W. Bush on Wednesday (26 May) invited Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to attend next month's G-8 summit in the US state of Georgia.
The summit will focus on the US-proposed Greater Middle East Project.
Turkey would participate as a US partner with a significant role in the Middle East.
In other news Wednesday, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation announced plans to build infrastructure enabling it to broadcast in different languages and dialects.
The initiative is consistent with efforts to recognise minorities in Turkey and their rights to use their native languages, a political requirement for EU membership.

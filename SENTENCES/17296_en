BELGRADE, Serbia -- Without explanation, the Belgrade Second Municipal Court granted temporary release Friday (December 22nd) to five defendants on trial for allegedly helping fugitive Ratko Mladic. 
The court ordered the immediate release of Jovan Djogo, Stanko Ristic, Ljiljana Vaskovic, Sasa Badnjar and Blagoja Govedarica. 
Djogo, Badnjar and Govedarica remain under house arrest, however, and their international passports were seized. 
A total of 11 people, including former officers of the Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb armies, have been charged with helping Mladic evade capture.

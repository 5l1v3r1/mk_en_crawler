BELGRADE, Serbia -- Speaker Oliver Dulic suspended indefinitely parliament's spring session soon after it began on Wednesday (March 5th) because the government did not provide its formal position on a resolution proposed by the opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS). 
It would allow Serbia to continue negotiations with the EU and join the European family of states only if Kosovo is considered part of Serbia. 
The nationalist and populist parties in the government, including Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), support the idea. 
The pro-EU oriented members of the ruling coalition -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) and G17 Plus, as well as smaller opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party and ethnic minority parties -- feel it does not even merit debate by lawmakers. 
SRS official Tomislav Nikolic says his party will work to dismiss Dulic, a DS member, for suspending the session.

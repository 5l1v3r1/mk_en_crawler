TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities in Rome arrested the driver detailed to Albania's embassy Sunday (August 24th) after allegedly finding 1kg of cocaine in the trunk of a diplomatic car.
Police arrested Arsen Selmanllari, 33, and an Albanian female companion after stopping him for a parking violation.
Officers said Selmanllari seemed overly nervous, prompting them to check the trunk of the car, where they allegedly found two packages containing the cocaine.
Authorities in Tirana lifted Selmanllari's diplomatic immunity so Italian authorities could continue their investigation.

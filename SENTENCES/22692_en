SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Islamic Community Council is urging Bosniak politicians to unite, warning that the recent division among the main Bosniak parties in the Federation of BiH "undermines Bosniaks' national interest".
In a declaration adopted on Saturday (April 5th), the Council also urged all Bosniak parties to participate via a single list in Republika Srpska's (RS) local elections this autumn.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik issued a response Sunday, saying the Council "only confirmed that it is a political and not a religious organisation".

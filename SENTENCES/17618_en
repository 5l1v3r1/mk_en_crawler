BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said that a Kosovo status resolution by the UN Security Council is desirable, but not the only option available.
Polt, whose term ends this summer, said that a decision from the Security Council will be welcomed, but if this doesn't happen, the US will look for another way to settle the status.
The ambassador reiterated US support for Martti Ahtisaari's proposal for supervised independence in Kosovo, and blamed Russia and Serbia for the fact that the status issue has not been settled.
Also Thursday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told the AP that his country was encouraged by signs of opposition in some EU countries to Kosovo's independence.
He said the government would intensify negotiations to convince Pristina and the international community to accept a compromise solution.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors in Zagreb pressed felony charges against retired General Vladimir Zagorec on Monday (December 10th) for obstructing evidence.
The same charges were brought against Susanne Di Mauro Bunjevac, who is accused of aiding Zagorec in attempts to improve his position in proceedings against him.
In March, Zagorec was arrested in Vienna, on the basis of an international warrant issued in Zagreb.
A trial was launched against him in absentia.
According to the indictment, Zagorec stole 5m euros in government funds.
He is also suspected of pocketing a number of diamonds that were to be used to guarantee an illegal arms deal during the 1992-1995 conflict.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele reaffirmed on Tuesday (November 16th) that the EU integration of Western Balkan countries is in the bloc's interest, as it would help strengthen regional stability. 
Fuele was speaking at a conference hosted by the European People's Party that took place in the European Parliament. 
He praised the progress registered by Balkan countries over the past year but acknowledged the challenges ahead. 
Fuele announced he will visit Belgrade next week to deliver the European Commission's questionnaire. 
The responses will determine Serbia's readiness for formal EU candidate status.

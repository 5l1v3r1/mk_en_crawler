TIRANA, Albania -- In remarks published in local media on Tuesday (1 June), Italian Ambassador to Albania Attilio Massimo Iannuci said construction of Pan-European Corridor 8 is important to the integration process of the entire Balkans.
Although the Corridor was excluded from an EU funding priority list, the Union is trying to convince Albania that work on the project will begin.
Ianucci said "maximum engagement of all regional countries" and better co-ordination would help attract foreign donors.
In other news, Albania's border police have increased control at the border with Greece in light of the upcoming Athens Olympics.
The decision to beef up security reportedly followed a meeting between the countries' interior ministries.

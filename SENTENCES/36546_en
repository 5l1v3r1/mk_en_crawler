NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged residents of Kosovo to "demonstrate their genuine and concrete commitment" to a multiethnic society, in which the rights of all minorities would be respected and guaranteed. 
In a statement to the Security Council released on Thursday (5 August), the UN chief said much must be done to repair the physical and psychological damage caused by the March riots. 
Annan welcomed a declaration by Serb and ethnic Albanian leaders last month in which they committed themselves to work for the return of those displaced by the riots. 
He urged Kosovo to speed up the rebuilding of destroyed homes. 
An estimated 2,400 people are still waiting to return to their villages.
In other news, the US State Department welcomed plans by UNMIK to build a new coal power plant in Kosovo, which has been plagued by electricity shortages. 
"This plan should be seen as a step towards economic interdependence with the rest of the region," the State Department said.

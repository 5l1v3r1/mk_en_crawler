ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ended weeks of speculation on Wednesday (August 8th) by naming a secularist for the post of parliament speaker. 
After consulting with leaders of his Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the opposition, Erdogan chose Koksal Toptan, who had served as education and culture minister in previous governments before joining the AKP. 
He is expecting an easy win over two other candidates for the post Thursday. 
The leaders of two opposition parties, the Republican People's Party and the Democratic Left Party, met with him Thursday and backed him.
Politicians are now awaiting the announcement of the AKP's nominee for president. 
The previous candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, was rejected by the opposition. 
Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the third-ranking party in parliament, the Nationalist Movement Party, warned that any attempt to nominate Gul again would lead to a new political crisis.

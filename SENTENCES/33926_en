BUCHAREST, Romania -- The president of the US Committee on NATO, Bruce Jackson, said Saturday (8 November) that Romania should not be considered a hindrance to Bulgaria's effort to join the EU. 
He spoke on the sidelines of an international conference on the development of Euro-Atlantic structures for the Black Sea region, held in Bucharest. 
Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana also dismissed fears that his country could delay Bulgaria's integration into the EU, saying Romania would complete accession talks by the end of 2004.

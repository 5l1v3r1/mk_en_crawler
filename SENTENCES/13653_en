NEW YORK, United States -- The negotiations on Kosovo's final status will begin in January, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari said Tuesday (20 December). 
He explained that the process would start with discussions on measures to improve conditions for minorities, then proceed to decentralisation and ways to improve the province's economy. 
Ethnic Albanians, he said, cannot achieve these goals alone and need support from the Serb community. 
He urged Serbs to join the political process.
During a trip to Sofia Tuesday, Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj said he hoped talks on Kosovo's final status would be completed by mid-2006. 
He expressed support for Ahtisaari's pledge to move forward with the negotiations quickly. 
Mustafaj met with his Bulgarian counterpart, Ivaylo Kalfin.

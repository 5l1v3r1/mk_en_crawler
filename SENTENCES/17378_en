BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu called on Tuesday (February 27th) for increased efforts by the Ministry of Administration and Interior to fight organised crime. 
During a session assessing ministry activities in 2006, Tariceanu said authorities must prevent indicted criminals from fleeing the country, as controversial Syrian businessman and terror suspect Omar Hayssam did. 
Tariceanu added that Bucharest's priority must be joining the European Schengen area by 2012.

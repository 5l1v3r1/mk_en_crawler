ATHENS, Greece -- The search for the remains of those aboard a downed Chinook helicopter continued in Halkidiki, northern Greece on Tuesday (14 September) with an oceanographic vessel and a deep-sea craft assisting in the operation.
All 17 people aboard, including Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria Petros VII, died when the helicopter crashed into the sea Saturday.
Greek prosecutors, meanwhile, started a probe into the purchase of the helicopter, amid reports it was known to have problems when flying at a certain speed.

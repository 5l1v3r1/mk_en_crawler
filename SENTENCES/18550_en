ST PETERSBURG, Russian Federation --Russia's position on Kosovo is well-known and has not changed, Russian leader Vladimir Putin told Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica in St Petersburg on Saturday (June 9th). 
The two met on the sidelines of an international economic forum, held at the weekend. 
Putin said that his views on Kosovo differed from those of his Western colleagues, and that the G8 summit in Germany earlier this week facilitated a better understanding of Moscow's approach. 
Moscow opposes the adoption of any plan that is unacceptable to Belgrade.
Kostunica, meanwhile, told Putin that Serbia could not accept the plan put forward by former UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari under any conditions. 
The plan, Kostunica said, would carve out 15% of what Serbia regards as its legitimate territory.

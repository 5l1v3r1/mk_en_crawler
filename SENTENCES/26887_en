TIRANA, Albania -- Senior government officials are closely monitoring the situation in the northwest regions of the country, devastated by storm-driven flooding over the past several days. 
"We are on the verge of a real catastrophe and, according to forecasts, heavy rainfalls will continue," Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Tuesday (January 5th) in Shkodra. 
Despite government orders to evacuate, some residents are refusing to leave their homes and cattle for fear of losing them to the floodwaters. 
Berisha said the situation is under control and called on women, children and older people to leave the area. 
In some villages around Shkodra, the water level has reached 80cm while rain is expected to continue in the next ten days. 
Opposition parties accuse the government of mishandling the situation.

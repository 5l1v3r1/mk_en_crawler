BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) called for early elections on Sunday (August 2nd), to overcome what it called a "deep parliamentary crisis". 
According to SNS officials, the conflict within the ruling coalition over the proposed law on public information suggests that the government and parliament are not functioning well and that there is no consensus on priorities. 
The bill, which would regulate media activities, caused enough tension among coalition partners that they agreed to postpone any vote on it until August 31st, allowing time to consult with journalists, media associations and European institutions, which reportedly have concerns about the draft. 
The next scheduled general elections in Serbia are not until May 2012.
In other news Sunday, the Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Belgrade, Jennifer Brush, told the Beta news agency that Washington will make every effort to help Serbia join the EU and NATO. 
She added that a main goal of the new US administration is a successful Serbia and a successful region, which would become a part of a successful Europe.

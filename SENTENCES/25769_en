ANKARA, Turkey -- A judge in Istanbul ordered the release Tuesday (October 20th) of five Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels who were detained Monday after arriving in Turkey from their bases in northern Iraq. 
The five were part of a group of 34 members of a so-called "peace group" -- militants and refugees alike -- who arrived in a gesture of reconciliation, following a call from their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan. 
The self-described "peace group" consisted of 26 people from the Makhmur refugee camp, and eight from Qandil Mountain, where the terrorist PKK's main camps are based. 
The judge ruled on Tuesday that the five detained upon their arrival could not be held because they returned under their own free will.

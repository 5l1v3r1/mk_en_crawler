ZAGREB, Croatia -- Montenegrin businessman Ratko Knezevic testified on Thursday (February 25th) that the so-called "tobacco mafia" was behind the October 2008 murders of prominent Croatian journalist Ivo Pukanic and his associate, Niko Franjic.
Knezevic said Pukanic first received threats in 2001 after publishing articles on cigarette smuggling.
He says the journalist told him he was offered a large amount of money to stop investigating the matter.
Knezevic added that he also has been threatened by businessman Stanko Subotic and people close to Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who allegedly tried to convince him to get Pukanic to drop the story.
The co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional was killed in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb with co-worker Franjic.
Four defendants are on trial in Zagreb.

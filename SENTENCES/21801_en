SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Srebrenica Mayor Abdulrahman Malkic on Monday (September 22nd) criticised The Hague war crimes tribunal for its handling of the trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
He is charged with war crimes committed in the 1995 massacre of an estimated 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica. 
Survivors and families of the victims are watching the trial "with anxiety and scepticism", Malkic wrote in an open letter to the tribunal. 
"We are surprised to find out that procedures are delayed and new evidence is required," he added.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Senior UN System Co-ordinator for Avian and Human Influenza Dr. 
David Nabarro said Thursday (12 January) that the Turkish government has been monitoring bird flu cases and is taking necessary measures to protect the public. 
He rejected concerns about Turkey's ability to contain the flu outbreak and the possibility of its spreading to the rest of Europe. 
The WHO, meanwhile, warned that Turkey's strain of the H5N1 bird flu may be a mutation of the virus and could be more capable of infecting humans.
In other news Thursday, Turkish Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said he would ask the court of appeals to examine the release of Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who wounded Pope John Paul II in 1981. 
Agca was released from prison Thursday after serving more than 25 years in Italy and Turkey for the plot against the pontiff and the earlier murder of a Turkish journalist. 
Cicek explained the government wants to be certain no errors were made in the case.

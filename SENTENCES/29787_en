GENEVA, Switzerland -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday (January 26th) there is progress in talks to reunify the divided island of Cyprus.
"It is clear that the two leaders worked to move closer together through a range of bridging proposals, notably in the chapters of economy, EU matters, governance and power-sharing," he said following a closed-door meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu in Geneva.
"More work must be done to reach further convergences on the outstanding core issues," Ban said.
He added that the two leaders have agreed to speed up the negotiating process and hold a series of additional meetings in the coming weeks.

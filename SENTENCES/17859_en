ZAGREB, Croatia -- Wrapping up a two-day meeting in Zagreb on Wednesday (March 21st), the Croatian-EU inter-parliamentary committee issued a statement supporting the country's EU membership bid in 2009 and efforts to participate in European Parliament elections that year. 
The document cited the progress Croatia has made in EU accession negotiations and recommended further talks on chapters of the acquis. 
But the declaration also stressed the need to accelerate reforms in the judicial and public administration sectors, as well as stepped up efforts against corruption.
In other news Wednesday, Croatia's Justice Ministry officially asked Austria to extradite General Vladimir Zagorec, the wartime deputy defence minister. 
He was arrested last week in Vienna on the basis of an international arrest warrant by Zagreb, which accuses him of misappropriating 3.7m euros in state funds during the former Yugoslav conflicts.

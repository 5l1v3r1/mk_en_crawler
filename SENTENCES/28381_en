SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Sunday (August 15th) that the country will absorb at least 50% of the EU funds set aside in the 2007-2013 budget framework.
In addition, EU Funds Minister Tomislav Donchev said the government's goal is for payments from the seven operational programmes of the EU structural and cohesion funds to reach 1 billion euros by the end of the year.
Borisov noted that the government received a very positive assessment during World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick's recent visit to Sofia.

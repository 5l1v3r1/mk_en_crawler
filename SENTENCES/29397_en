ZAGREB, Croatia -- Labour unions announced on Thursday (July 1st) they have gathered 813,016 signatures to call a referendum on proposed amendments to the labour law.
Calling a referendum requires 450,000 signatures.
The proposed amendments would set a six-month deadline for hammering out a new collective agreement after the existing one expires.
After that, the workers' rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers.
The unions started collecting signatures on June 9th.
On Thursday, they pointed out that the signatures account for roughly 20% of the entire electorate.

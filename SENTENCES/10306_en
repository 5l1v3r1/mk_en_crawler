LISBON, Portugal -- Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes said Sunday (24 October) that his government plans to increase the number of its troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and will dispatch a 300-strong unit to Kosovo next year, when the EU takes the peacekeeping mission over from NATO. 
Portugal currently has three F-16 fighter aircraft serving with KFOR, and has 297 soldiers in BiH. 
Santana Lopes says the mission allows his country to keep the balance between support for NATO-led missions and EU-led missions.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown denied rumours that Republika Srpska (RS) could be abolished, saying such talk was nonsense.
In an interview with the Serbian state TV RTS on Sunday (16 October), Ashdown said the existence of the Bosnian Serb entity is guaranteed by the Dayton Peace Agreement and this provision could not be changed unless the people of RS do so.
In other news, police in Banja Luka smashed a counterfeiting ring during a series of raids at several business facilities and private houses.
Illegal weapons and explosives were also seized.
Police say the group was linked with one recently discovered trading in stolen cars in the Bosnian Serb entity.

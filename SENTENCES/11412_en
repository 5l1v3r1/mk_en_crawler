BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (24 May) sought to reassure Turkey that its accession talks with the EU would start in October as scheduled, despite uncertainties over the French referendum on the European constitution and a possible change of government in Berlin.
A spokeswoman for Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said both the EC and the Turkish government are moving forward with preparations for the negotiations and that there were no immediate concerns over launching the talks on time.

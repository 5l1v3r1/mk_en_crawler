ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Thursday (16 June) protesting a statement by the lower house of the German Parliament. 
The German lawmakers criticised Ankara for downplaying the killings and deportations of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915, but stopped short of describing the massacres as genocide. 
The foreign ministry in Ankara said the Turkish people were deeply hurt by the German resolution, particularly since Germany is considered a traditional friend and ally.
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Beirut on Thursday and appealed for closer ties with Arab countries in his address to the Arab Economic Forum. 
He also called for more foreign investment in Turkey, stressing the country's economic potential.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Bucharest Court of Appeals on Thursday (November 19th) turned down a request from NGOs to suspend a referendum called by President Traian Basescu, scheduled for Sunday, the same date as the presidential elections.
If passed, the referendum would turn the bicameral parliament into a unicameral one, reducing the number of members from 471 to 300.
Basescu says this would streamline the legislative process and save money.
Thursday's decision can still be appealed at the Supreme Court.
In other news, Basescu and the two other presidential front-runners square off in their first televised debate on Friday.
The other two candidates are Social-Democrat Mircea Geoana and Liberal Crin Antonescu.

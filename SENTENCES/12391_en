ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ratko Macek, spokesman of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), said on Wednesday (6 July) that the HDZ-led government retains stable parliamentary support despite the departure of one deputy -- Mato Stimac -- from HDZ's caucus earlier in the day. 
HDZ retains 62 seats in the 152-member parliament. 
With its allies, however, the coalition cabinet still has the support of 76 lawmakers. 
Stimac left HDZ to join a group of non-aligned deputies in parliament. 
He also announced plans to establish a new political formation.
In other news Wednesday, authorities warned tourists not to swim too far from beaches because a large shark has been spotted near the coast. 
A 4-metre shark was sighted first off Pula, then near the resort of Rijeka. 
Coast guard cutters could not find it.

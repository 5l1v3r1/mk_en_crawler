PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ramush Haradinaj formally assumed office as prime minister of Kosovo on Monday (6 December).
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen defended the transfer of power, characterising it as "democracy at work." Following talks with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic at an OSCE meeting in Sofia, however, Jessen-Petersen also indicated that UN prosecutors would continue to investigate whether the former KLA commander was involved in war crimes during the 1998-1999 conflict.
For his part, Haradinaj said he is prepared to visit Belgrade or meet with anyone from there to discuss issues in the interest of Kosovo's people.

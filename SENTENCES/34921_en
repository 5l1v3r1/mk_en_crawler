BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Solana denied Wednesday (17 December) that he interfered in the upcoming Serbian elections during his visit to Belgrade earlier this week.
Spokeswoman Christina Gallach said Solana simply asserted that movement towards Europe is the right direction and that voters must choose between the past and the future development.
Solana denied having expressed support for any single party.

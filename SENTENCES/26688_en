SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov announced Tuesday (February 9th) that the European Commission (EC) has offered a favourable assessment of programmes covering technical assistance and regional development. 
Five others involving EU structural and cohesion funds will be assessed next. 
If they are positive, new transfers from the EU budget will be forthcoming. 
Those funds have been frozen for more than a year amid evidence of corruption and mismanagement. 
Prime Minister Boyko Borisov welcomed the news, saying the country "is ready to absorb EU funds transparently and effectively". 
He added, "If mayors are responsible and not corrupt, Bulgaria may absorb nearly 3.4 billion leva (around 1.7 billion euros). 
The local governments should prepare for hard work." (Standart, Sega - 10/02/10; BNR - 09/02/10)

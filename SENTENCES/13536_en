ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader ruled out the possibility Monday (23 January) of selling state-owned land and real estate to foreigners, saying such assets could be awarded only under concession contracts.
Sanader's comment came during a leadership meeting on the EU accession process and real estate market liberalisation.
Sanader added that as regards sale of private property, the government would launch a working group to draft legislation regulating the sector.

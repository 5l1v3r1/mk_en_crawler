SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of the parties attending the constitutive session of the House of Representatives met Wednesday (6 November) to discuss possible reforms to the BiH Council of Ministers. 
The talks focused on High Representative Paddy Ashdown's recent suggestions for ending the principle of rotation, enlarging the powers of the government's chairman, reducing the number of deputy ministers, and reforming civil service structures to improve policy planning and reduce bureaucracy.
In other news, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says a record number of minority refugee returns - over 80,000 - were registered in BiH during the first nine months of the year. 
That compares to less than 57,000 last year.

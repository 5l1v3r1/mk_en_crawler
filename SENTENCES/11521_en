ZAGREB, Croatia -- Stipe Mesic was inaugurated as Croatian president on Friday (18 February) at a ceremony attended by several heads of state from neighbouring countries, as well as Poland's Aleksander Kwasniewski and Ukraine's Viktor Yuschenko.
During his speech, Mesic, who won a second mandate in a presidential run-off in January, vowed to continue promoting democratic and market reforms leading Croatia toward membership in the EU and NATO.
EU officials, however, have said the opening of accession talks, scheduled for 17 March, could be delayed due to insufficient co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In an interview for a local newspaper, Mesic said he understood the Union's concerns.
"Croatia had covered up other war crimes suspects in the past.
We gave them places and jobs and in the end none of their helpers were brought to trial although we knew who they were," he said.
However, he insisted that no one currently in power was helping fugitive General Ante Gotovina -- one of the UN tribunal's top three most-wanted indictees -- evade justice.
On Saturday, Mesic told a local radio station that he was confident that co-operation between Croatian and international secret services would bring concrete results, and that membership talks with the EU would begin as scheduled.

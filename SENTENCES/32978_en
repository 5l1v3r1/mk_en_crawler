BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The People's Assembly of BiH Republika Srpska adopted the guidelines for defence reforms on Wednesday (25 June).
The document sets a framework for drafting the final model of the armed forces and supports the work of the Defence Reform Commission.
It recognises the functioning of the republican army under a joint military command with the BiH Federal Army.
The reform plan envisions the downsizing of the professional military staff in Republika Srpska from 7,000 to 5,000 and reduces military service from six months to four months.

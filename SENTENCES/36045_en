SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 73 per cent of Bosnians want their country to join the EU, according to a survey published Thursday (25 March).
It found that most people in the country associate EU membership with better living standards for their children, more jobs and economic recovery.
Bosnians cited crime, corruption, a poor economy and impunity for war crimes suspects as the greatest obstacles to the integration process.
At the same time, 32.6 per cent of respondents said that the political parties were not working to bring BiH closer to Europe.
Only between 6 per cent and 7 per cent think that the ruling nationalists in both entities are committed to EU membership.
Brussels has said that it would open talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Sarajevo this year, the first step towards EU membership.

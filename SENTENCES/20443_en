BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Simon Wiesenthal Centre called for the resignation of Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu on Friday (November 9th) over recent anti-Roma statements. 
Late last week, Cioroianu suggested in a TV interview that Romas be deported to camps in the Egyptian desert to perform hard labour. 
He also said that Romanians of Roma origin committing crimes abroad bring shame on their homeland. 
Although he later apologised, the NGO Wiesenthal Centre urged Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu to replace Cioroianu and to apologise to the entire Roma community in Europe.

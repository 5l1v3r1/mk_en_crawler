ZAGREB, Croatia -- The one-week deadline Slovenia gave Croatia to cancel its protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic expired on Tuesday (January 22nd) without result.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said no one should give ultimatums and urged "all factors" in the dispute, particularly Slovenia, to act as Europeans.
He reiterated that Croatia has initiated a discussion of the ZERP issue with the European Commission, Italy and Slovenia.
In response, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said no discussions were held because Croatia has not proposed anything that would suit Slovenia, Italy and the European Commission.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The interior ministry says Romania began producing new electronic passports on Wednesday (December 31st).
The move aims to harmonise the country's passport-issuing procedures with EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents applicable in all member states.
Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea said the issuing of the new electronic passports is yet another step in Romania's efforts to join the so-called Schengen Area in 2011.

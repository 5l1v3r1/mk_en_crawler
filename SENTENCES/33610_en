ZAGREB, Croatia -- Slovenia's Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Bekes, has returned to Zagreb following several weeks of absence.
He was recalled in late August due to the bilateral dispute over the establishment of a maritime economic zone in the Adriatic.
Slovene Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel issued a statement Saturday (13 September) saying Bekes' return to duty was a "gesture of good will" and that he hoped problems would be resolved through a constructive dialogue.
Negotiation teams from the two governments are expected to meet this week.

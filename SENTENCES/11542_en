BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In a report published Monday (24 January), the Brussels-based International Crisis Group said Kosovo is threatened by new unrest and potential war if the issue of its final status is not resolved soon.
"Either 2005 will see the start of a final status solution that consolidates peace and development or Kosovo may return to conflict and generate regional instability," said the report.
It recommended that the protection of minorities should be set as a condition for Kosovo's progress.
The organisation has cautioned that the solution should not be delayed any longer and urged the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to appoint immediately an envoy to mediate negotiations on a draft agreement.

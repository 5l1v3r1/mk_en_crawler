ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities reported Tuesday (4 May) that long lines of trucks are forming at the Krapina-Macelj border checkpoint because of Slovenia's problems with applying the new EU customs laws. 
Local media quoted a Slovenian official who said that the situation would improve in August when a new border checkpoint is completed.
In other news, the Croatian statistical office reported that the country's debt has risen to 53 per cent of GDP, unemployment has hit 19.1 per cent, and the trade deficit has increased to 23.5 per cent of GDP.

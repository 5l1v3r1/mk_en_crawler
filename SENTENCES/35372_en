ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia should expect a positive signal from the EU concerning its bid for membership, British Minister for Europe Dennis MacShane said during a trip to Zagreb on Monday (19 April).
The European Commission is to release a report Tuesday on Croatia's readiness to start accession talks.
MacShane went on to add that he was confident that the issue of fugitive war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina would be resolved by 19 June.
That is when the EU Council of Ministers meets to decide whether to start membership negotiations with Croatia.
Britain and the Netherlands had blocked Croatia's bid because of its failure to arrest Gotovina, one of the UN tribunal's most wanted suspects.

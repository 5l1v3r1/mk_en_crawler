BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic is calling for the start of negotiations on the final status of Kosovo.
He said Thursday (16 January) that the province is moving gradually towards independence and that the time has come to address the issue of its future.
He did not specify who should attend the talks, but called on the EU to become involved.
The UN mission in Pristina has indicated repeatedly that it would be up to the UN Security Council to decide the future of Kosovo.
The Council insists that Kosovo must make progress in democratic reform, respect for human rights, and the return of refugees before the question of its final status could be addressed.
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia strongly opposes Djindjic's proposal.

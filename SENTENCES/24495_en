TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha on Thursday (May 7th) promised government support to Albanian immigrants living in Greece. 
Meeting with their representatives in Tirana, Basha stressed that the government expects to reach an agreement soon with Athens authorities regarding social insurance and pensions for Albanian immigrants in Greece. 
Other priorities are teaching the Albanian language in schools across Greece and visa liberalisation.
Also in Tirana, opposition parties met with representatives of the Albanian diaspora, promising them that if the parties win the June elections, they will enable almost 1 million Albanians living throughout the world to vote in future elections. 
The Socialist Party and its small ally, G99, stressed that money the expatriates send to relatives in Albania amounts to more than the annual Foreign Direct Investment in Albania.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu strongly criticised on Monday (April 2nd) the proposal by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu for a new cabinet, which would include only Tariceanu's National Liberal Party and the ethnic Hungarian UDMR, excluding Basescu's Democratic Party completely. 
The premier's move came amid a continuing row with Basescu that has strained ties between their parties. 
Following the new government suggestion by Tariceanu, Basescu sent a letter to Parliament, warning that approval of such a cabinet composition would breach the will of the electorate. 
Parliament is due to vote on the new cabinet late Tuesday.

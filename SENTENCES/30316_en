ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Friday (May 13th) that wrapping up EU accession talks by the end of June is a realistic target. 
According to her, Zagreb has met all criteria in the critical field of judicial reform. 
Her statement followed a meeting with ambassadors of EU member states to present Zagreb's final reports on the two most problematic chapters in the EU accession talks -- those on competition and judiciary, and fundamental rights. 
The government adopted the document Thursday.

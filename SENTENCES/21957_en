PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government should apply for the status of EU membership candidate as soon as possible, Slovakia's Ambassador to Belgrade Igor Furdik told Montenegro's Vijesti newspaper in an interview Monday (May 19th).
Belgrade signed its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on April 29th.
Furdik says Slovakia wants all countries in the region to become EU members.
When asked about any advice that could help in the fight against corruption and organised crime, he stressed the importance of creating an atmosphere in society that would increase the willingness to tackle such problems.

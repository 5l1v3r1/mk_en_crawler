Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Djurdja Adlesic returned to Zagreb at the weekend after a five-day visit to Afghanistan, where she met with Afghan officials and visited Croatian troops.
Adlesic is the highest-ranking Croatian official to visit her country's troops in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan. 
There are more than 300 Croatian service members there.
Adlesic met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul and with environmental and restructuring agency head Prince Mostapha. 
Karzai highlighted the importance of the Croatian military presence in Afghanistan and praised the soldiers. 
He welcomed the announcement that Croatia will continue to have troops on the ground in the ISAF mission. 
The two also discussed bilateral economic co-operation.
Since Croatia will be joining NATO next year, the country's presence in peacekeeping missions around the globe is increasing. 
Afghanistan is one of the most important areas where its soldiers have served, and their experience in the ISAF mission is considered very valuable.
Adlesic spent three days in the Croatian military encampment in Afghanistan and reviewed ongoing humanitarian projects in the country. 
She also visited a kindergarten that Croatian troops sponsored and rebuilt.
Her visit to Afghanistan remained a closely guarded secret until just before her return home. 
The media did not cover the journey for security reasons.

SYDNEY, Australia -- A man wanted for war crimes in Croatia has been arrested in Sydney. 
Antun Gudelj, 59, hid in Australia for five years before he was picked up on a Croatian international arrest warrant and brought before a local court Thursday (21 September). 
Gudelj, a Croat and former policeman, is accused of murdering three Serbian officials in a car in eastern Croatia in 1991. 
He will also be charged with one count of attempted murder. 
Croatia initially sought his extradition in 2001.

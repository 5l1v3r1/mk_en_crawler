PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Institutions and diplomatic missions in Pristina reportedly were "alarmed" on Tuesday (August 17th) after a document calling for the independence of Serb-dominated northern Kosovo appeared in public. 
The so-called "declaration of independence" for the "Association of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo" was not signed, nor were its authors identified. 
According to local media reports, Serb parallel institutions may have initiated it. 
Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi dismissed it as a provocation by "desperate people". 
Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said on Tuesday that Belgrade does not support the so-called declaration, adding it can only make the security situation in Kosovo worse.

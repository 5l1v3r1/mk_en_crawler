BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic announced on Monday (15 November) that he has tendered his resignation, citing concern over what he described as serious violations of legislative procedures. 
Markovic -- a member of the ruling coalition partner G17 Plus -- suggested he is particularly dissatisfied with the practice of allowing lawmakers to vote with each other's voting cards, without actually attending sessions.

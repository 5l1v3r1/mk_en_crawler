After a six-year break, train service between Pristina and Skopje resumed on 27 February.
Many heralded the line's relaunching as a symbol of restored ties following the years of crisis in this part of Southeast Europe.
For the time being, only passenger service is being provided.
However, members of the business community would like to see freight transport resumed as well.
"Better transport means better business," says Besim Idrizi, who has connections to Kosovo through his business in construction materials, as well as through family and social ties.
"Currently, transport of loads is only being managed in large trucks.
It is preferable to stop conflicts and develop business."
Expansion of services to include transport of goods will likely depend on the transformation of Macedonian Railways, a process expected to begin soon.
The rail company says it will base its decision on the level of interest.
Currently, the train provides service twice a day.
Under an agreement with the civil authorities in Kosovo, customs and police checks are conducted at the Blace border crossing.
The train departs from Skopje at 9:40 am.
and at 4:10 pm.
It stops at Skopje Sever, Gorce Petrov, Volkovo, Jankovik, Urosevac and Kosovo Pole, finishing its journey in Pristina.
The ceremonial relaunch of the Skopje-Pristina line took place in December, when a group of Macedonian government ministers made the journey.
However, as it turned out, they acted a little too quickly, as procedures for the control of passengers and goods had not been established and facilities were lacking.
As a result, the service was delayed.
In only two months, however, the facilities were built and the trains now run.
Should goods transport begin, customs and phytosanitary inspections of agricultural products would be carried out at Volkovo, about 10km from the border.

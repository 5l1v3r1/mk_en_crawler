PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon has asked to meet with President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Thursday (August 20th) to discuss an agreement on police co-operation that EULEX and Serbia plan to sign. 
"There have been a number of misunderstandings regarding the Police Protocol between the EULEX and Belgrade. 
I would like to clarify some of these issues during my meetings," de Kermabon said Tuesday. 
He explained that EULEX has no intention of signing the protocol on behalf of Kosovo, but only on behalf of the mission. 
EULEX maintains it can sign a protocol on police co-operation based on its executive powers.

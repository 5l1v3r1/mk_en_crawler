SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The OSCE Mission to Skopje called on Wednesday (12 July) for the processing of crimes related to the 5 July parliamentary vote. 
While international observers generally found the elections compliant with the international standards, they also noted numerous incidents during the campaign and on Election Day, said mission chief Carlos Pais. 
Addressing irregularities and sanctioning perpetrators is as crucial as all other phases of the election process, he said.
The State Election Commission announced on Wednesday that it is invalidating results in two settlements, Dzepciste and Bogovinje, where voting was interrupted for three hours. 
No date for the repeat vote has been announced.

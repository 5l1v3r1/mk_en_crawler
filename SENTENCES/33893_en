STRASBOURG, France -- Numan Hazar, Turkey's Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe (CoE), presented on Wednesday (12 November) the country's official approval of the 6th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, which envisions abolition of the death penalty in times of peace.
CoE Parliamentary Assembly President Peter Schieder called it a step of huge political significance.
In other news, the CoE delegate's committee ordered Turkey to pay 768,000 euros in compensation to Greek Cypriot citizen Titina Lozidou by 19 November or face sanctions.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled earlier this year that Turkey had violated Lozidou?s property rights and restricted her freedom of movement.

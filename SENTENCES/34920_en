ZAGREB, Croatia -- An IMF official told reporters Wednesday (17 December) that there are concerns about Croatia's foreign debt, which is expected to reach 16.7 billion euros or 74 per cent of GDP by the end of the year. 
Hans Flickenschild expressed regret that Zagreb ignored the Fund's advice to borrow more money domestically and instead insisted on getting foreign loans. 
But he praised Croatia's economic performance in 2003 and the improved balance of payments.

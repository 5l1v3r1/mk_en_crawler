TIRANA, Albania -- Helmut Lohan, head of the EC delegation in Tirana, said Brussels welcomes a political roundtable scheduled for Saturday (February13th).
President Bamir Topi is organising and mediating the session, aimed at ending a parliamentary boycott the opposition Socialist Party (SP) has been staging since September.
SP lawmakers are demanding an investigation into alleged manipulation that occurred during the June 2009 general elections.
Lohan said that, "...
it is up to [the] political leaders of Albania to find a solution in order to continue European integration in line with the country's interests."
The EU Presidency welcomed the initiative Thursday, praising the readiness of Albania's two biggest parties -- the SP and the ruling Democratic Party -- to participate.

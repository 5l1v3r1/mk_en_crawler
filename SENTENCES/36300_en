WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department on Thursday (27 May) warned Americans travelling to Istanbul that the city might become the target of protesters and terrorists during next month's NATO summit. 
Travellers were advised to stay away from the meeting's venues and to expect tight security measures.
In other news, Turkey has agreed to send three helicopters to the NATO-led international stabilisation force in Afghanistan, with a crew of 56 pilots and ground staff. 
They will leave for Kabul on Saturday.
Meanwhile, both Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan have dismissed reports that the United States wants to open new military bases in Turkey. 
But General Staff Deputy Chief General Ilker Basbug has been quoted as saying that Washington has requested permission to deploy military aircraft at bases in the south of the country.

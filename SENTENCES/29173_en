BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in London will start deliberating on Serbia's request for the extradition of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic on Monday (July 5th), Serbia's war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Sunday.
Vukcevic said the hearings will continue over several days, and he voiced hope that the court will approve Belgrade's request.
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport based on a warrant issued by Belgrade.
Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.
Ganic has denied the charges.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leaders of the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), met on Monday (January 22nd) to discuss internal problems and possible changes in the party statute. 
The meeting was called after differences between incumbent party leader Radmila Sekerinska and her predecessor, Vlado Buckovski, deepened and he announced he might form a splinter group within the SDSM. 
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE plans a party congress of its own in mid March.

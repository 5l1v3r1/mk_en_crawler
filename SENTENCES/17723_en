BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday (July 23rd) to discuss a host of issues, including efforts to determine the future status of Kosovo and the plight of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who are being held in Libya.
Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs Luis Amado and his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner urged all EU member states prior to the meeting to maintain a united stand on the Kosovo issue.
"We are already faced with a difficult situation", which could be complicated if "the EU is unable to maintain a position of coherence and cohesion", AFP quoted Amado as saying.
Analysts anticipate opposition by several countries, including Spain, Greece, Cyprus, and Slovakia.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin warned on Sunday that a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo would be a bad option if upcoming talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians fail.
He added that new talks would be pointless if they begin and end like the previous negotiations.
On Monday, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku and members of Kosovo's negotiation team will meet in Washington with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic meets with her on Thursday.
The Bush administration backs former UN envoy Maartti Ahtisaari's concept of supervised independence for Kosovo.

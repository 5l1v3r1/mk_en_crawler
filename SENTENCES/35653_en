SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A visiting EU-NATO delegation told BiH presidency members Dragan Covic and Borislav Paravac Wednesday (4 February) that BiH must meet three pre-conditions in order to join NATO's Partnership for Peace:
appointment of a state minister of defence, detention of war crimes indictees and a functional Security and Information Protection Agency.
Discussions also focused on peacekeeping troops in BiH and the future status of the BiH armed forces.
The presidency's Bosniak member, Sulejman Tihic, was in Brussels holding similar discussions with EU security chief Javier Solana.
In other news Wednesday, Federation of BiH President Niko Lozancic said no changes to the entity government are expected soon, as one of the two vice presidents opposes a requested cabinet reshuffle.
By law, the president and his two deputies must agree on any such move.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN war crimes tribunal President Fausto Pocar went before the UN General Assembly on Monday (October 13th), calling for the immediate arrest of high-profile fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
In a speech in New York, Pocar stressed that all UN members must co-operate with the tribunal by arresting fugitives and by providing documents, access to witnesses and witness protection.
Pocar praised Serbia for the arrests of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in July and former Bosnian Serb police commander Stojan Zupljanin in June.
"However, we cannot successfully accomplish our work if the last two remaining fugitives are not arrested immediately," he said.
In Belgrade, the head of Serbia's national council for ties with the tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, told the daily Danas "activities on a literally daily basis" are underway to find Mladic and Hadzic.
Ljajic described the effort as "a race against time" in view of Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz's visit next month.

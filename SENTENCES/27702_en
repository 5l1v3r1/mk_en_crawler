TIRANA, Albania -- Political parties in Albania must complete electoral reform ahead of the May 2011 local elections, OSCE head of Mission Eugen Wollfarth said on Thursday (November 25th).
"It is important to work on the reform in a democratic manner and for the debates to take place inside parliament," Wollfarth said during a meeting with representatives of the municipality of Durres.
Earlier this month, the government invited various political parties to meet and start work on the reform, but the opposition seems unwilling.

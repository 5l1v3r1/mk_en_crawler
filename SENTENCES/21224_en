THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeals chambers with the UN war crimes tribunal on Friday (June 27th) allowed the provisional release of the former head of the Serb intelligence service, Jovica Stanisic, and fellow indictee Franko Simatovic.
Stanisic and Simatovic, former commander of the elite Serb forces, are charged with arming and training militias who committed war crimes against non-Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia.
Stanisic, who headed Serbia's intelligence during the Milosevic regime, was allowed to leave the prison temporarily to receive medical treatment in Belgrade.
He will be under strict surveillance in a military hospital there.
His trial was postponed on May 16th for "at least three months", and is due to resume after his recovery.
It was the fourth such postponement due to Stanisic's physical and mental condition.
He suffers from various conditions including depression and kidney stones.

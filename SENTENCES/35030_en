SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling National Movement Simeon II and coalition partner Movement for Rights and Freedoms want to see the EU accession referendum held at the same time as next year's parliamentary elections, Deputy Parliament Speaker Kamelia Kassabova said Tuesday (29 June).
The parties are also proposing that the referendum would only cover EU accession, and not the European Constitution.
In other news, Sofia's suspended mayor, Stefan Sofianski, reportedly will seek reinstatement Wednesday.
He was removed from office during a probe into allegations of mismanagement stemming from the 1998 sale of a city market.

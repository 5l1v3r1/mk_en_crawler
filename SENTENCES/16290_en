BUCHAREST, Romania -- The president of the joint EU-Romania parliamentary committee, Guido Podesta, said on Thursday (13 April) that Romania is ready to accede to the EU.
He added that signals from EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn were as positive as possible, and that Romania is far more advanced than many of the ten member states that joined in 2004.
His comments followed a meeting with Romanian Minister for Integration Anca Boagiu.
Also Thursday, Mediafax reported that France has started procedures to ratify Romania's EU Accession Treaty.
Parliament's Rapporteur for Romania, Jacques Myard, presented a report to the foreign affairs committee, arguing for ratification.
Myard visited Romania in early March, to assess progress towards accession.
He predicts ratification at the end of May or the beginning of June.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police on Monday (22 December) arrested five men suspected of trying to smuggle a large group of illegal immigrants into Greece. 
An unknown number of them died when their boat sank off the Turkish town of Marmara. 
The only known survivor, Iranian national Hussein Dadkhani Marci, told police that a Turkish man captained the boat for some time after it left shore. 
He then boarded a speedboat, telling passengers they would soon reach the Greek island of Rhodes. 
Shortly afterwards the boat started to take on water and sank.
In other news, Greek coast guards detained 53 illegal immigrants aboard a Ukrainian-registered sailboat. 
The passengers included Kurds, Iraqis, Iranians, and Palestinians. 
The two Ukrainian crewmembers were also arrested.

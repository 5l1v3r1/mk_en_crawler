ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities vowed on Monday (January 28th) to make every effort to receive an invitation for NATO membership at the Alliance's summit in April. 
"We hope to be able to do all that's necessary in the next couple of months," Prime Minister Ivo Sanader told journalists, after meeting with members of the state commission on NATO membership. 
President Stipe Mesic says the country has nearly completed structural reform of the army and is on the right track to full implementation of NATO standards.
Meanwhile, European Parliament Rapporteur on Croatia Hannes Swoboda published his latest report on Croatia's progress on Monday. 
While praising some gains, he called for more efforts in terms of political, administrative and economic reforms. 
Swoboda also urged the government to resolve open issues with neighbours, particularly implementation of a controversial protected fishing zone in the Adriatic.

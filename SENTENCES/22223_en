PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK is refusing to recognise the winners of weekend local Serbian elections held in Kosovo, insisting the results are illegal. 
"None of the elected in these elections will be a partner of UNMIK," UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko said on Wednesday (May 14th). 
"We will talk only to the representatives appointed by UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker in the five municipalities with a Serb majority," he added. 
While reiterating that Serbia's effort violated its international obligations, he said UNMIK wants to establish good relations with the government in Belgrade.
In other news, Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni continues his swing through Central America, seeking recognition of Kosovo's new statehood. 
On Wednesday, Hyseni was in Panama, meeting with ambassadors and diplomats representing Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
He briefed them on developments in Kosovo since Pristina declared its independence on February 17th, stressing actions to protect minorities.

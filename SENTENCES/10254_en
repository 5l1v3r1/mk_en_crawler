SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The rightist opposition Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, which announced last week plans for a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, said Tuesday (26 October) it has abandoned the idea due to lack of support from other parliamentary powers.
In other news, President Georgi Parvanov is in Slovenia, part of a five-day trip to the Adriatic.
Slovenian counterpart Janez Drnovsek assured Parvanov that Ljubljana favours Bulgaria's scheduled entry into the EU in 2007.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The former Yugoslav states face a long, demanding road to EU membership that depends on their own abilities to carry out needed reforms, said Slovene Minister for European Affairs Janez Potocnik. 
He wrapped up a Balkan tour with a stop in Sarajevo on Monday (14 July), where he attended a seminar on his country's experience in the accession process. 
It drew about 100 participants representing the BiH government, parliament, media, NGOs and civic associations. 
In Sarajevo, Potocnik also met with members of the tripartite BiH presidency and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic.

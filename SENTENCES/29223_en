PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander Azem Syla answered questions before the Special Prosecution on Wednesday (August 4th), as a suspect in the so-called Bllaca case. 
Nazim Bllaca, who faces accusations of murder and other criminal activities, claims he was operating under the orders of Syla at the Kosovo Intelligence Service. 
Syla is maintaining his innocence, and his lawyer said this would be the only appearance of his client related to the case. 
Special prosecution sources, however, say that he will be invited again for additional questioning. 
Syla was released after the interrogation.

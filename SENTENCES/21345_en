BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is urging Albania to complete its electoral system reforms by September, Dirk Lange, head of the unit for Albania and BiH in the EC Directorate General for Enlargement, said on Thursday (June 26th) at the 18th meeting of the EC-Albania Consultative Group in Brussels. 
"By electoral reform, the EC means the approval of the constitutional amendments and completion of the amendments in the Electoral Code, based on as wide political consensus as possible," the Albanian Ministry of European Integration said in a statement. 
Minister Majlinda Bregu says Albania is close to implementing all requirements needed for electoral and other reforms.

YEREVAN, Armenia -- President Serzh Sargsyan said on Friday (April 10th) he expects his country's border with Turkey to re-open by October.
"I think I will cross an open border to attend the next football match [between the two countries' national teams on October 14th]," he told a press conference in Yerevan.
Turkey and Armenia have had no diplomatic relations for more than a decade.
Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993 to support Azerbaijan's stance in the Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.
Another open issue is the killings of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917, which Yerevan insists was genocide.
The two neighbours launched a normalisation process and stepped up official contacts last year.
On Sunday, however, Turkey reiterated the border cannot open without a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
"There is an impression that Turkey will open the border although the Karabakh row is not resolved.
Such an impression is not correct," Yasar Yakis, head of parliament's Committee on EU Adjustment, told reporters.

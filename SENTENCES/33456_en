THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal said Friday (30 May) that former Red Beret commander Franko Simatovic has been transferred to its detention unit at Scheveningen.
He will appear before the tribunal on Monday to enter pleas on four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws and customs of war.
Fellow indictee Jovica Stanisic, the former State Security Service chief, remains hospitalised in Belgrade.
The government says his extradition would depend on a medical assessment later this week.

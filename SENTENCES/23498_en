NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat admitted on Monday (December 22nd) they have made insufficient progress in the ongoing reunification talks.
In a joint statement after a meeting in Nicosia, the two leaders said they recognise they still must consider "a long list of [negotiation] chapters" before they can propose a reunification deal for the divided island.
Monday's meeting was the last before the end of the year.
Their next meeting is scheduled for January 5th.
Separately Monday, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said settling the Cyprus issue remains the main goal of her country's foreign policy, adding she hopes "Turkey itself will realise that a Cyprus settlement is to the benefit of the Turkish people as well".
In other news, Cyprus' fire department is investigating a suspicious package mailed to the US Embassy in Nicosia on Monday.
The sealed package roused the embassy staff's suspicions and is undergoing testing for toxins.

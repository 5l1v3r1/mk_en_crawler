SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski reaffirmed on Thursday (August 19th) that his government remains committed to resolving the longstanding name dispute with Greece. 
He said that UN mediator Matthew Nimetz is in touch with both sides, but added he does not know when a new round of talks between Skopje and Athens will be called. 
The prime minister also rejected the idea that the government is obstructing Macedonia's EU integration process. 
He noted that last year's progress report by the European Commission was favourable and the only obstacle along Skopje's EU path is the name row.

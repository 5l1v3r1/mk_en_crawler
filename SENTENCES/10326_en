ZAGREB, Croatia -- In a statement released Wednesday (24 November) by the British Embassy, Minister for Europe Denis MacShane called on the former Yugoslav countries to fully co-operate with The Hague tribunal.
He urged authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro to invest more effort in tackling issues cited by the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, in her speech this week to the UN Security Council.
Del Ponte criticised the three countries, especially Serbia and the Serb-run part of BiH, for their lack of co-operation.
She noted that the three most wanted war crimes indictees -- Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croat Ante Gotovina -- remain at large, allegedly protected by powerful networks in their countries.

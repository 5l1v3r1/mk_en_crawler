BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia rejects any partial implementation of the interim trade accord it signed with the EU, as proposed by the Netherlands and Belgium last week. 
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic insisted late on Saturday (June 20th) that such a solution would be "inadequate" and warned it is dangerous to put Serbia in some alternative legal category, as far as implementing its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU is concerned. 
He warned such a move could delay Serbia's progress in getting official EU candidate status. 
Amsterdam insists Serbia first capture war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic.
Meanwhile, Swedish Ambassador to Belgrade Krister Bringeus says it is still possible for Serbia to file its bid by the end of the year. 
Sweden assumes the rotating six-month EU presidency on July 1st. 
He added that Stockholm opposes any partial enforcement of the interim trade accord.

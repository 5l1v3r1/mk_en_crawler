BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Tuesday (12 July) asked the EU's 25 member states to approve a mandate for launching negotiations with Serbia-Montenegro.
The EU leaders decided in April that Belgrade is ready for talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step towards future full membership in the Union.
The SAA prepares the candidate for the next and more decisive stage, accession negotiations.
The EC noted, however, that "negotiations can be suspended if Serbia and Montenegro's progress towards fulfilling key conditions stalls -- most notably progress towards achieving full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague".
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus has described EU membership as Serbia's top domestic priority.

ANKARA, Turkey -- All remarks regarding Turkey's new constitution draft will be taken into consideration, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday (September 14th).
The draft is ready and will be sent for review first to all NGOs and political parties, before being opened up to public comment.
It will also be presented to the ambassadors of EU member-states, and to officials in Lisbon, as Portugal currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
The new constitution eventually will be adopted by the people themselves via referendum, Erdogan said.

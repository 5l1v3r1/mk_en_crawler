BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica declared on Saturday (May 19th) that the new government would take the necessary steps for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, but he ruled out any territorial concessions in exchange for EU integration. 
In an interview with the state news agency Tanjug, Kostunica, who assumed office a few days ago, reiterated that his cabinet is committed to the realisation of EU membership, but stressed that Serbia would never accept losing Kosovo. 
He noted again that Belgrade is prepared to hold new talks aimed at finding a compromise to the Kosovo status issue. 
Kostunica said he does not believe that the UN Security Council will adopt a resolution by which "a UN member country is deprived of 15% of its territory".

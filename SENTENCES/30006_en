TIRANA, Albania -- Incidents continue to mar the campaign ahead of the May 8th local elections.
In the eastern city of Pogradec, an explosion rocked the apartment of an opposition Socialist Party official early Sunday (April 17th) morning, causing property damage.
The official, Vasfi Syza, says political opponents planted the explosive device.
Meanwhile, in the outskirts of Tirana, a Socialist Party supporter was pelted with rocks and sent to hospital after clashing with rival Democratic Party supporters.
The incident happened when the area was preparing to welcome current Socialist leader and Tirana Mayor Edi Rama.
Campaign-related incidents continue despite calls from institutional leaders and international officials in Tirana.

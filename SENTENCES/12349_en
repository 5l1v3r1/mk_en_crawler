THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The presiding judge in the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday (11 January) criticised the defendant and one of his witnesses for providing irrelevant testimony. 
Patrick Robinson said the witness, a French nurse, was merely giving "general impressions" about what she described as the plight of Serbs. 
He likened her testimony to a "conversation over a cup of tea", adding that it was not relevant to the specifics of Milosevic's case.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Although it hasn't recognised Kosovo's independence, Greece has decided to honour passports newly issued by the Kosovo government and to issue visas to Kosovo citizens. 
The head of the Greek liaison office in Pristina, Dimitros Moschopoulos, announced the move Friday (September 19th), after meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. 
Montenegro and Macedonia have also decided to accept the new passports without recognising the self-declared country's independence. 
The new documents will replace those issued by UNMIK.

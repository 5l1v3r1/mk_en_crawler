BUCHAREST, Romania -- State anti-corruption prosecutors have opened an investigation against Deputy Prime Minister George Copos, Realitatea TV channel reported on Thursday (19 January). 
At issue is the suspected embezzlement of 1.5m euros in 2004 via the sale of the Romanian Lottery company. 
Copos is one of the wealthiest men in Romania, the richest cabinet minister and a member of the Conservative Party. 
Realitatea TV says he will be called to testify about the case next week.
In other news Thursday, the government forwarded to parliament for urgent consideration a package of laws reforming the public administration and decentralising power. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said the measures would expand the executive powers of local authorities, and in line with EU practices, give them more financial independence and responsibilities.

TIRANA, Albania -- IMF mission chief in Albania Gerwin Bell urged the government Tuesday (April 7th) to reduce budget expenditures this year because revenues are not expected to rise. 
Bell made the recommendation at a meeting with Finance Minister Ridvan Bode and Central Bank Governor Ardian Fullani. 
The IMF predicts slight economic growth in 2009, but given the global economic crisis and its effects on banks, the government should seriously consider the suggestions, Bell said.

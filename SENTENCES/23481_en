TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a controversial lustration law Monday (December 22nd) requiring all candidates for official positions undergo investigation to determine whether they co-operated with the secret services during the communist regime.
Opposition lawmakers left the chamber, saying the government is trying to destabilise the political scene before the June 2009 parliamentary elections.
The government insists the law is needed to define this period of history.
The bill will allow a special commission to dismiss judges and prosecutors who served during the former communist regime without due process in courts.
In other news, the ruling Democratic Party reached an agreement Monday with the opposition Social Movement for Integration to pass a new aviation code, establishing a legal framework for the country's aviation industry and its services.
But the main opposition Socialist Party warned it would boycott all parliamentary sessions, insisting that lawmakers should first pass a new election code.
Small opposition parties say the one passed just last month excludes them from election committees.

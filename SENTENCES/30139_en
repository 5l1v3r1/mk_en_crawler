ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu rejected on Tuesday (March 22nd) media reports that the crew of an Iranian plane forced to land Saturday in southeast Turkey were arrested. 
According to local reports, the plane, bound for Syria, was suspected of transporting weapons. 
Rocket launchers and Kalashnikov rifles were found onboard and reportedly as many as seven crew members were detained. 
But Davutoglu said on Tuesday that the plane was stopped for a "routine" inspection, which took longer due to its cargo, which he did not describe. 
He insisted that none of the crew was arrested.

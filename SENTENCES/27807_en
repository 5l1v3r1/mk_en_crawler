ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government and the trade unions agreed on Tuesday (November 23rd) on a referendum requested by union representatives, even though the issues that first prompted it -- proposed labour legislation -- have been largely resolved. 
Voters will be asked "Do you agree that a referendum must be called if so requested by 200,000 registered voters, and that the time for the collection of the required number of voters' signatures should be 30 days?" This referendum will be held on the same day as a referendum on the country's EU accession.
In other news Tuesday, leaders of four opposition parties in parliament signed an agreement to work together in the next general elections and establish a coalition called "Union for Changes". 
The deal was struck by Zoran Milanovic of the Social Democratic Party, Radimir Cacic of the Croatian People's Party, Ivan Jakovcic of the Istrian Democratic Assembly, and Silvano Hrelja of the Croatian Pensioners' Party. 
The parties' main objective will be to form a coalition government after the next elections. 
The parties are part of the left-wing bloc in parliament, which currently enjoys strong popularity, according to public opinion polls.

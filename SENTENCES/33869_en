ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Security cameras captured the image of one of the suicide bombers who carried out devastating attacks on two Istanbul synagogues Saturday. 
Interior Minister Abdulkdir Aksu said Monday (17 November) that one of the bombers could be discerned on security film shot an instant before the blast at the Neve Shalom synagogue. 
"But it's not clear. 
We're trying to clarify and make an identification," he told <I>Vatan</I> newspaper. 
An Arabic newspaper said a unit of the al Qaeda network had claimed responsibility for the bombings and warned of more car bombings against the United States and allies Britain, Italy, Australia and Japan -- a statement that triggered nervousness on world markets.
Aksu said the planning of Saturday's attacks, which killed 23 and wounded 300, was conducted by a "foreign source". 
After visiting the sites of the explosions with Israeli counterpart Silvan Shalom, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul did not dismiss the possibility of an international link but said there was no positive connection at this stage.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) adopted its annual enlargement package Tuesday (November 9th) that assesses achievements of the Western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland in their EU integration process and points out the challenges ahead.
Presenting the documents, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele stressed that no country will join the bloc before being 100% ready.
Overall, they registered progress in implementing political reforms, but at the same time, urged more efforts in fighting organised crime and corruption, implementing the rule of law and respecting freedom of expression.
The reports also warned that the reform momentum has slowed in some EU aspirant countries.
The EC proposed granting candidate status to Montenegro, confirmed that Croatia is on its way to completing the accession process, and said Serbia is capable of meeting the criteria set out in its Stabilisation and Association Agreement but must co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
It again recommended that accession talks be opened with Macedonia, but noted that this requires a consensus among EU member states and thus a solution to the name dispute with Greece.
Albania has failed to meet the conditions for opening negotiations, the EC said.
It expressed concern about the lack of progress in BiH, and said Turkey has yet to comply with one of the obligations of its candidate status -- opening its ports and airports to traffic from Cyprus.
Finally, the EC affirmed that it intends to start dialogue with Kosovo on visa liberalisation, but wants to see the government there implement a plan on integrating returnees from the EU.

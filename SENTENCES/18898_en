BUCHAREST, Romania -- Representative of Romanian religious groups said on Thursday (January 4th) they are unhappy with the new law on cults and plan to challenge it at the Constitutional Court and European Court of Human Rights.
President Traian Basescu promulgated the law on December 26th, despite opposition by several NGOs.
The religious communities say the law would make the process of recognising the status of a cult more difficult.
They also worry about provisions regarding denigration and public offence to religious symbols.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegro intends to apply for EU candidate status by the end of this year, Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic said on Thursday (October 30th). 
She met with French Ambassador Bernard Garanche to inform him of Podgorica's intentions. 
Djurovic said she expects the support of France, the current EU presidency holder. 
Earlier, Garanche advised the Montenegrin government to defer its application. 
It already postponed its application once, in June. 
At the time, Montenegrin officials pledged to file the application by the end of the year.

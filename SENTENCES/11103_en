BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic said Monday (27 June) he anticipates settlement of the key issues of BiH police reform and public broadcasting system restructuring by the end of November.
He added that the RS government must work on behalf of police reform in the coming months so that RS is not blamed for blocking BiH's EU integration.
Also Monday, EUFOR personnel and the Federation of BiH police raided the premises of the Lijanovici meat processing factory in Siroki Brijeg.
The owners of the plant are accused of tax abuse in a case that also involves former BiH presidency member Dragan Covic.
On Tuesday, Covic's successor, Ivo Miro Jovic, took over the rotating presidency chairmanship from Serb member Borislav Paravac.
Jovic was appointed in May after Covic was removed from office.

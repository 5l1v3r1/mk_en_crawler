BELGRADE, Serbia -- Romanian President Traian Basescu and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica share the stance that a compromise solution must be found to the Kosovo status problem, the two said after their meeting in Belgrade on Friday (23 June). 
They met for talks during Basescu's one-day working visit to the Serbian capital, the first one paid by a foreign state leader after the former federal union between Serbia and Montenegro split. 
According to the Romanian president, it is extremely important to come to a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and to ensure a solution, which will guarantee the stability, European future and security in the region.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition party, the Socialist Party (SP), insisted on Tuesday (April 8th) that electoral reform should focus on establishing a regional proportional system.
"Through this system, every election region will have a representative from the big and small parties in the parliament," SP leader Edi Rama said.
Opposition parties with fewer representatives in parliament oppose the proposal but are struggling to strike a compromise.
Rama spoke during a meeting of the SP's National Assembly in Vlora.

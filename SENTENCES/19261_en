ANKARA, Turkey -- The justice ministry says it is beginning to see the results of intensified diplomatic efforts to find Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists who fled Turkey after staging attacks. 
On Thursday (November 29th), the ministry announced that two PKK members -- Mehmet Iltas and Mehmet Esref Kizilay -- were extradited from Germany and are now being held in a Turkish prison. 
Turkey is hunting more than 170 other PKK members internationally.

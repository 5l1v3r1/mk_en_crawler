SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic said Monday (2 August) that he will soon arrange a meeting with Sulejman Tihic, the chairman of the main Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA). 
Tihic is also the chairman of the BiH tripartite presidency. 
At issue is the recent upheaval in the RS government and the possible replacement of the three SDA ministers. 
Mikerevic's Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) and junior coalition partner Party of Democratic Progress agreed to dismiss the SDA ministers from the RS cabinet, following High Representative Paddy Ashdown's decision to remove SDS economy and interior ministers.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriots are refusing to speed up negotiations to reunify the island and won't until the international community exerts pressure on them, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat told a press conference Saturday (July 18th).
While Turkey is actively supporting ongoing efforts to find a solution to the Cyprus problem, the Greek Cypriot administration still needs to demonstrate good will, he noted, adding the Turkish side has already committed to holding a referendum on reunification by the end of this year.

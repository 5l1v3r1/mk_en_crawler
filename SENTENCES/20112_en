ATHENS, Greece -- Police used tear gas on Tuesday (January 15th) to disperse another protest by dock workers at the two main commercial ports, in Thessaloniki and in Piraeus.
Port employees in Thessaloniki managed to slip inside a building where representatives of the Maritime Trade and Transport Ministry were discussing government plans to privatise the two commercial facilities.
Dock workers at both ports say privatisation will eventually lead to job cuts.
They held a protest on Friday and plan another one Wednesday.

NIS, Serbia -- The plan drafted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari is the best available option for Kosovo, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said at the end of a two-day visit to Serbia Tuesday (March 6th).
The status issue would be resolved this year, he stressed.
"Whatever the outcome, it is the strong position of my government that the presence of the Serb community in Kosovo, its religious and cultural institution ...
will be preserved," Fried added.
He acknowledged that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica are not prepared to accept the blueprint, but said this should not prevent them from making recommendations on improving conditions for the Serb minority.
Later, during a visit to northern Kosovo and a meeting with Kosovo Serb mayors, Fried said that neither side in the status negotiations would win everything and neither would lose everything.
In other news, a British officer has been appointed head of Kosovo's 1,500-strong international police force.
Richard Monk, who spent 35 years with the UK police, has also served in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the OSCE.
He replaces Stephen Curtis who stepped down following a riot in Pristina last month in which two protesters were killed.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday (March 25th) to discuss possible ways to rescue Greece from its grave financial crisis.
Though discussions will be wide-ranging, EU aid is not officially on the agenda, the matter will be discussed at another meeting Thursday -- an extraordinary session of the eurozone members.
Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker has said he does not rule out an option in which Greece might need help from the other eurozone members, as well as the IMF.
Greece, on the other hand, has said it wants its problems settled within the EU.

SYDNEY, Australia -- A court in Sydney has approved the extradition of former Serb militia commander, Dragan Vasiljkovic, to Croatia, where he is charged with committing war crimes against prisoners of war and civilians in Croatia and BiH between 1991 and 1995. 
Vasiljkovic, also known as "Captain Dragan", is eligible for transfer to Croatia, though he has 15 days to appeal the ruling before a higher court. 
He holds dual Australian and Serbian citizenship and has lived in Perth for years, working as a golf instructor.
In other news Wednesday (April 11th), the UN tribunal announced that former Bosnian Serb army officer Momir Nikolic has been transferred to Finland to serve his 20-year prison sentence. 
He was sentenced last year for his role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The NATO House Association initiated a series of programmes Friday (6 June) to allow young people to learn more about the NATO integration process in Romania.
The main idea of the programmes, set up in co-operation with Babes-Bolyai University, is to boost interaction between the public and public institutions concerning NATO entry.
Organisers hope to establish clubs in major universities to help publicise aspects of NATO membership and Euro-Atlantic integration in general.

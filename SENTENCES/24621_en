BELGRADE Serbia -- The government has been gathering new information about war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic's location and will arrest him, Serbian President Boris Tadic told an international Southeast European security conference Thursday (March 5th) in Belgrade. 
"Serbia is absolutely determined to deal with every sort of crime, including war crimes," he said, adding any effort by previous governments to protect certain people was history. 
Mladic's arrest would allow the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the EU.
In other news Thursday, Justice Minister Snezana Malovic dismissed three Supreme Court judges for releasing Milorad Bracanovic, a former deputy chief of Slobodan Milosevic's secret service. 
The three ordered Bracanovic's early release during an appeals hearing earlier this month. 
He was serving a two-year sentence for failing to prevent the killing of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic and the attempted murder of opposition leader Vuk Draskovic in 2000.

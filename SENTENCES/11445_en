BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Rasim Ljajic, the federal minister for human rights and minorities, on Tuesday (25 January) urged four generals wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal to surrender voluntarily. 
By doing so, he said, the four would lift a heavy burden from their country, which could then "continue on its way to Europe". 
Ljajic is also head of Serbia-Montenegro's council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
In related news, Olli Rehn, the new European commissioner for enlargement, met with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic. 
Afterwards, Rehn told reporters that "Belgrade has to show more significant, and not minimal, results in its co-operation with the tribunal." For his part, Draskovic urged Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to "make the moves that must be made".

NICOSIA, Cyprus --Cypriot politicians, including President Demetris Christofias, have received threatening letters, security sources and local media reported on Wednesday (November 10th).
According to the reports, the letters were identical and contained a kitchen knife.
According to security sources, it appeared they focused on disagreements concerning policies in the ongoing reunification talks.
Police spokesperson Michalis Katsounotos downplayed the threats, saying they represent a low risk.
He added the letters, signed by a person calling himself Iraklis (Hercules), were sent at the beginning of October.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The upper house of parliament will debate police reform bills Wednesday (April 16th) that are crucial to BiH signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
The measures were narrowly approved last week by the lower house. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn welcomed that, but says it is now important that the House of Peoples complete the legislative procedure. 
Slovenia, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, has said that that once the laws are adopted, the SAA would be signed "as soon as possible", with April 28th as the most frequently mentioned date. 
The local press is already speculating about a possible timetable for BiH's entry to the EU. 
According to the Dnevni Avaz newspaper, if everything goes well, BiH could receive candidate status next year and join the Union as early as 2014.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu announced on Thursday (March 13th) that the government would amend the resolution on organising local elections.
The changes would permit county council heads to be elected by majority vote, rather than the current, proportional vote system.
It would mean voting directly for candidates, not for parties.
Critics, including those in the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), say this is a purely procedural move, aimed at delaying local elections, which are now scheduled for June 1st.
The PSD is threatening to table a no confidence motion, if the government proceeds with its plan.

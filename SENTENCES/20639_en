BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Belgrade City Assembly appointed Zoran Alimpic as new chairman of the city council and new mayor of Belgrade on Monday (October 8th), succeeding Nenad Bogdanovic, who died of cancer last month.
Alimpic will serve until new local elections are called, probably by the end of the year.

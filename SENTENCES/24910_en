SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Presidential candidates formally kicked off their campaigns on Monday (March 2nd) after leaders of Macedonia's main political parties, the VMRO-DPMNE, the Social Democratic Union (SDSM), the Democratic Union of Integration and the Democratic Party of Albanians, met on Sunday and called for fair and democratic elections.
The March 22nd presidential vote is seen as key to Macedonia's EU accession bid.
The VMRO-DPMNE, which formed a campaign coalition with 18 smaller parties, has nominated law professor Georgi Ivanov for president.
Polls suggest he is the front-runner at this point.
The other leading contender is Professor Ljubomir Frckovski, nominated by the SDSM.

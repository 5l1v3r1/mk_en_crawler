BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Albanian National Army (ANA) on Sunday (17 August) claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in southern Serbia near the border with Kosovo. 
ANA, which UNMIK has defined as a terrorist group, said on its Web site that the attack had been carried out by "Colonel Alban Shkaba". 
In an interview, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said the ANA did not actually exist and the attacks had actually been carried out by members of the Kosovo Protection Force (KPF). 
KPF spokesman Enver Dugolli denied the allegation and said his organisation had nothing to do with the ANA.

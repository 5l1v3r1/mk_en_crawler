ROME, Italy -- Police announced on Sunday (April 19th) the arrest of Serbian neo-Fascist leader Goran Davidovic, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant. 
Davidovic leads the right-wing extremist movement Nacionalni Stroj. 
Serbian Justice Minister Snezana Malovic confirmed his arrest in Trieste and said that police found some "pretty interesting documents" in his apartment, as well as a "laptop, flags and clothes with signs and symbols of the extremist right, CDs and several floppies". 
By law, Italy has 60 days to decide whether to extradite Davidovic to Serbia. 
He faces charges there of inciting nationalist, ethnic and religious hatred and intolerance, as well as of physically attacking participants in an anti-Fascist forum in Novi Sad late in 2005.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Council of Europe on Wednesday (3 March) recommended halting the special monitoring of the human rights situation in Turkey.
"Turkey has clearly demonstrated its commitment and ability to fulfill its statutory obligations as a Council of Europe member state," the pan-European body said in a statement that sums up Ankara's record over the past three years.
Turkish Justice Minister Cemil Cicek hailed the decision, saying it "lifted a cloud" off his country.
The formal decision to lift the monitoring arrangement will be adopted next month.(AFP, Anadolu Agency - 03/03/04)

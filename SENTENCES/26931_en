PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX spokesperson Christophe Lamfalussy confirmed on Wednesday (August 5th) that a formal investigation into suspected organ trafficking in Kosovo and northern Albania is under way and investigators are looking for evidence. 
Belgrade says members of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army kidnapped Serb civilians during the Kosovo conflict and took them to camps in northern Albania, where they removed their organs for sale on the black market. 
Serbian war crime prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic gave documents to that effect to Council of Europe special rapporteur Dick Marty on Tuesday. 
Marty made a two-day fact-finding mission to Serbia before travelling to Albania.

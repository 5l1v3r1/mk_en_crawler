BAGHDAD, Iraq -- A US military spokesman said Saturday (14 June) that the pipeline linking the Kirkuk oilfields with the Turkish port of Ceyhan should be operational within 48 hours. 
A gas explosion on Thursday damaged the 900km pipeline. 
The spokesman blamed the incident on negligent maintenance. 
Thamir Ghadhban, the official in charge of Iraq's oil industry, said exports of Iraqi oil are expected to start from Ceyhan around 20 June.

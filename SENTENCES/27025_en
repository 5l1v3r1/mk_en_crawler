PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Electricity supplies in the Serb-dominated town of Strpce were fully restored on Monday (August 3rd) after 70% of the residents reimbursed the Kosovo Energy Corporation the agreed-upon sum of 26 euros per household. 
The town was hit by power cuts last month because of unpaid bills. 
Residents went without electricity for more than a month.
In other news, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic told the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti on Monday that Serbia should boost its institutions in Kosovo, as local institutions are not helpful to Serbs. 
He added that Belgrade will help Serb communities and other non-Albanians through economic investments, especially in the education and health care sectors.

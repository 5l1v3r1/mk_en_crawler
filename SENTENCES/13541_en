ATHENS, Greece -- British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw visits Cyprus, Greece and Turkey this week. 
The Cyprus situation will top his agenda, along with EU matters. 
Greece has cautiously welcomed the trip, saying it could improve the situation. 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan praised the initiative, saying it would "complement" UN efforts to mediate a settlement. 
However, Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has refused to meet the foreign secretary, because of Straw's plans to hold talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.
According to Ankara media reports on Tuesday, meanwhile, Turkey is enlisting the help of Moscow in ending the international isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. 
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

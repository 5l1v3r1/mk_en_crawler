ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has lifted a ban on the popular YouTube website. 
A local court ruled on Wednesday (7 March) that internet providers should not allow access to the site because it carried videos insulting the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. 
Ahter Kutadgu, head of corporate communications for Turk Telekom, told reporters on Friday that his company had been advised by the court that the ban had been lifted. 
Subscribers have now regained complete access to the website and its content.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government launched a pilot project Sunday (30 July) for a one-desk local integration system at the country's border checkpoints, aimed at curbing corruption, Darik News reported.
Interior Minister Rumen Petkov and State Administration Minister Nikolay Vassilev unveiled the new system at the Lesovo checkpoint on the border with Turkey.
Six new computers service the system, based on the "one slip, one payment" principle.
Cash payments would be made directly at bank branch offices at the checkpoint.
This should also increase the quality and speed of border services and improve tax collection.

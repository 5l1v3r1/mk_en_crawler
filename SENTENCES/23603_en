SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A gunman hijacked a bus with 40 to 50 passengers aboard on Tuesday (January 27th) before surrendering to police a few hours later.
The bus was travelling from Sofia to the Black Sea resort of Varna.
The hijacker, identified as Miroslav Blazhev, 33, allegedly pointed a gun at the driver and said there was a bomb in the luggage compartment.
A search later turned up no explosives.

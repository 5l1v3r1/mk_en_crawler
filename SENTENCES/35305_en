PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- International prosecutors have charged three ethnic Albanians and a Serb in connection with the mid-March riots in Kosovo, a UN spokesman said Thursday (17 June).
The charges range from inciting violence to arson.
UN police have arrested 270 suspects so far.
International prosecutors are handling the 52 most serious cases, while 200 minor cases have been transferred to the local judiciary.
Soren Jessen-Petersen, the new chief of UNMIK, said Thursday he faces a serious challenge in Kosovo.
He promised to "move the agenda" forward in the interest of all communities in the province.
Also Thursday, the OSCE kicked off preparations for Kosovo's general elections in late October.
Voter lists are to be updated by 10 August.

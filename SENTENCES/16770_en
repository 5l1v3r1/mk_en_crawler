SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Service for the Fight Against Organised Crime (NSFOC) has launched a nationwide crackdown against Internet piracy, according to an interior ministry announcement Monday (8 May). 
The action is directed against local Internet providers who offer illegal content, as well as end-consumers who illegally upload and download music or films. 
Late last week, the NSFOC arrested four users in Sofia, who are suspected of having uploaded some 22 TB, equal to approximately 22,000 gigabytes, of illegal information over the past year. 
If convicted, they face sentences of between one and five year's imprisonment and fines of up to 1,500 euros.

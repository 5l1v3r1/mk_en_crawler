BERLIN, Germany -- Kosovo is one of the topics at NATO's Parliamentary Assembly in Berlin. 
Participants are also discussing the Alliance's deployment and presence in Afghanistan and the Balkans. 
The forum, which opened on Friday (May 23rd), debated NATO's presence in Kosovo after June 15th, when the new constitution enters into force. 
For the first time, members of the Kosovo parliament attended the spring summit, prompting Serbian and Romanian delegations to leave the meeting in protest. 
Both delegations' countries refuse to recognise Kosovo's independence. 
Representatives from 53 counties are attending the Assembly.

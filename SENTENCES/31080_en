PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador Christopher Dell has reiterated his view about Kosovo's need for a "clean-handed" and legitimate government.
Dell said that the new government should be successful and ready to face challenges, TV 21 reported on Saturday (February 5th).
"There is a need not only for a government with clean hands, but also a government which people have confidence in, and I think that only then the government's credibility -- which has been considerably damaged by events in the last few months -- can be restored," Dell said.
He wants the new government established before Independence Day on February 17th.
Snap elections were held in December.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country could seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU less than six months from now, as long as it upholds agreed-upon reforms, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Monday (February 4th).
At a meeting between members of the European Parliament and members of the Joint Committee for European Integration of the BiH parliament, he recalled the EC has set four conditions for signing a SAA.
They are police reform, public administration reform, reform of the public media broadcaster and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Lajcak warned that BiH is running out of time and suggested that the international community could take certain measures to facilitate reform.
The head of the European Parliament's Committee for Southeast Europe, Doris Pack, agreed and noted the country's integration pace lags behind the rest of the Western Balkans.
The main Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Action, recently surprised everyone by announcing plans to abandon police reform talks and oppose the future legislative package.

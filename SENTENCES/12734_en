BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said Wednesday (4 May) that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains the last obstacle to joining NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
Following talks with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Brussels, Davinic returned to Belgrade and said the Pact has acknowledged Serbia-Montenegro's readiness for PfP membership.
The major condition, he said, is rounding up all war crimes indictees, especially Ratko Mladic.

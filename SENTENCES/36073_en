BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu said Monday (22 March) that the November elections would not sway his country from the path of reform and the pursuit of its "crucial goal" of completing accession talks with the EU by the end of the year.
"It is less important to know who will win the elections than to be sure that the winner will not question the Euro-Atlantic integration programme as well as the principles of the rule of law and a market economy," Iliescu said.
In other news, the IMF Executive Board decided on Monday to delay by two weeks its assessment of arrangements with Romania over the last 14 years.
The start of final talks on the new precautionary agreement between Romania and the Fund will be postponed as well.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Monday (22 September), High Representative for BiH Paddy Ashdown called for the quick adoption of a defence bill proposed by the state committee for defence reforms. 
He described the document as a big step towards membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, possibly by year's end. 
Most of the major political parties support the bill. 
However, the Party of Democratic Action, representing Bosnian Muslims, has expressed concerns over the status of the new armed forces.
Also Monday, the BIH cabinet adopted a bill revising the budget in accordance with IMF recommendations. 
The government seeks spending cuts of 110m euros in the budget for this year, to curb the rising foreign trade gap.

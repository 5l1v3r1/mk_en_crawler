PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Before heading to New York on Sunday (April 1st), Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu voiced optimism that Kosovo will gain supervised independence -- as envisioned in UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for resolving the province's status -- within three months. 
Sejdiu will be participating in the UN Security Council session Tuesday, when Ahtisaari's proposal will be discussed.
On Sunday, Serbia's outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, also bound for New York and the UN session, said his country believes Russia will support the preservation of Serbia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. 
He said such a support would have "historic significance" for Serbia. 
Moscow has hinted that it could use its Security Council veto to block any proposal that is unacceptable to Belgrade.
In other news, UNMIK deputy chief Stephen Shook and Kosovo Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Ibrahim Selmanaj paid separate visits at the weekend to the Serbian Orthodox Decani monastery, the target of a mortar attack Friday. 
Both officials condemned the incident.

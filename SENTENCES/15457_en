SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Friday (22 September) transferred Bosnian Croat suspect Pasko Ljubicic to BiH, following a decision in April to hand over the case to the local judiciary.
Ljubicic, who headed the Croat Defence Council's 4th Military Police Battalion during the war, was indicted for crimes against Bosniak civilians in the Lasva valley in 1993.
His extradition had been postponed twice for health reasons.

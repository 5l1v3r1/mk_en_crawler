BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said late last week that the summit that begins Tuesday (November 28th) in Riga would send an encouraging message to aspirant states, particularly the three Adriatic Charter signatories:
Albania, Croatia and Macedonia.
De Hoop Scheffer said the final declaration would include "a reconfirmation of NATO's open-door policy".
The next expansion will likely take place in 2008, he added.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement Tuesday (22 March) rejecting recent criticism from the West that his country had slowed the pace of reforms since December 2004.
During a visit to Brussels, Erdogan said he had received no such indication from European leaders.
He also confirmed that Ankara would seal an enlarged customs union agreement with EU, which includes Cyprus.

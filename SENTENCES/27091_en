SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament approved a declaration Thursday (February 4th) in support of a European Parliament (EP) resolution condemning crimes committed in Srebrenica in 1995.
According to the document, Macedonia will commemorate July 11th as a day of remembrance for the nearly 8,000 Srebrenica victims.
Macedonian lawmakers stressed that full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal is a precondition for the EU integration of Western Balkan countries.
The EP passed its resolution just over a year ago.

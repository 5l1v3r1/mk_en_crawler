PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The interim government officially opened a contest Wednesday (June 13th) to design a new national flag and emblem. 
The contest, based on UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence, is open to all. 
Entries cannot copy the state symbols of any other countries, and the colours used cannot replicate those on either the Albanian or Serbian flags. 
All entries are due within two weeks. 
The winner will receive 10,000 euros.
In other news Wednesday, the Kosovo High Court ordered that Albin Kurti, the leader of the Vetevendosja (Self-determination) movement, be detained for 30 more days. 
He has been in custody since a violent pro-independence rally in February that left two dead and many others injured.
The same day, the Kosovo Police Service announced that an 18-year-old Kosovo Albanian was arrested for allegedly attacking an elderly Serb woman in Pristina, breaking her nose. 
The Serbian government's Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo says the Tuesday incident was ethnically motivated.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Foreign Ministry denied on Tuesday (August 14th) reports that five Chinese citizens caught at Mother Teresa Airport in possession of falsified visas got them from the Albanian Embassy in Beijing. 
The five appear to have been using Albania as a transit country for travel to other European states.

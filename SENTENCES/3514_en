After more than 1.5 million shares of Croatia's major oil company, INA, were sold earlier this month on the Zagreb Stock Exchange -- raking in a profit of more than $478m -- the government has offered another 2% of shares to investors. 
Most of the buyers made cash purchases, while a few bought stocks on credit. 
The public is eager to find a quick and easy profit. 
To purchase INA stock, one needs to have proof of Croatian citizenship and agree to hold on to the stocks for a year.
Considering the country's relatively low standard of living, the key question may be "should the public buy INA stock at all?"
As INA is a company with stable finances, some speculate that the purchase is a good long-term investment. 
Hopes run high, as many remember the financial success of stockholders in the early 1980s. 
Still, the current mass stock sale is not without criticism. 
Some warn that it might be misleading naïve investors to buy and sell.
The purchase prices are relatively low and affordable for long-term investors, but buyers complain that the company remains in state ownership. 
The government offered favorable stock purchase credits at a low share cost of about 5,500 euros per package. 
One share is worth 270 euros and 1.5 million shares were available for purchase to Croatian investors.
By all indications, the INA stock sale has come at an opportune time: savings accounts, foreign capital and general bank funds are experiencing growth. 
When it comes to the privatisation of INA, as soon as state ownership is relinquished, the stock value is expected to climb.

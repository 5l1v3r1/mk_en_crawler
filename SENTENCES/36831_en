WASHINGTON, United States -- The Bush Administration is mulling whether to keep a key military base in Orao, in northeast Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), after the completion of the SFOR mission later this year, according to media reports Tuesday (13 July).
The issue is part of a new US draft concept for strengthening the fight against terrorism, under review at the Pentagon.
According to the draft, around 150 US troops might remain in Orao, after NATO hands its military mission over to an EU force.
The base could be used as a venue for forward deployment, if required, and possibly shared with EU partners.

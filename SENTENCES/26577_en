SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives supported an initiative Wednesday (February 10th) to change the constitution and the election law in accordance with a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.
The court ruled in December that the constitution, created as an annex to the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreements, discriminates against minorities.
The court agreed with a complaint filed in 2006 by Dervo Sejdic, who is of Roma origin, and Jakob Finci, who is Jewish.
The pair argued that the constitution forbids people who are not Bosniaks, Croats or Serbs from running for president or for seats in the upper house of parliament.
The initiative for constitutional changes envisions drafting a plan for amendments by the end of February.

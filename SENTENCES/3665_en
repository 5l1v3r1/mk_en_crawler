Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) war crimes court delivered verdicts against three indictees last month, imposing its most severe sentences so far. 
Nedo Samardzic, Dragan Damjanovic and Nikola Andrun and received 24, 20 and 13-year prison terms, respectively, for offences committed during the BiH conflict.
On December 13th, Samardzic was found guilty of detaining several Bosniak women, including two minors, and using them as sex slaves. 
He and other members of the Bosnian Serb army allegedly held the victims captive at a house near Foca and raped them on a daily basis.
Damjanovic, meanwhile, was found to have participated in a widespread and systematic attack by the Republika Srpska Army on the Bosniak population in Vogosca municipality.
In September 1992, he broke into the house of a married couple, where he harassed and beat them and then forced himself on the wife. 
Both testified at the trial. 
In January 1993, Damjanovic engraved a cross on the forehead of detainee Mujo Abaz, who also provided testimony, describing the torture in detail.
Andrun, said to have been a deputy commander of the Gabela detention camp in the Capljina municipality and a member of the Croatian Defence Council, was convicted of torture, participation in torture, and inhumane behaviour. 
He was found to have taken part in the physical and mental abuse of a detainee at the Capljina police station. 
Andrun's defence team said the sentences were unfair.
"The punishment is too harsh because the defence witnesses -- there were 27 of them -- and also some prosecution witnesses failed to establish that Andrun was the deputy commander of Gabela Camp," said defence attorney Hamdo Kulenovic.
But representatives of the "Women Victims of War" said they welcomed the verdicts.

ATHENS, Greece -- The United States and Israel reportedly are pressing Greece not to extradite fugitive media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, who is wanted by Russia for alleged fraud totalling millions of euros.
New reports on Tuesday (26 August) quoted the government as saying only that there is strong international interest in the case.
Greek police armed with an international arrest warrant detained Gusinsky on Saturday after he arrived on a flight from Tel Aviv.
The former tycoon possesses dual Russian and Israeli citizenship.
His name was placed on Interpol's list at the request of the Russian authorities, who charge Gusinsky misappropriated 239m euros.

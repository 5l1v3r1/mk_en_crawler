BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Sreten Lukic, one of the four Serb police and army generals wanted by The Hague tribunal, reportedly is considering surrender. 
On Wednesday (19 January), unnamed government sources quoted by B92 said that Serbian authorities were holding separate talks with three of the indicted generals and that an agreement has been reached with Lukic. 
The Serbian cabinet has denied it was negotiating with the indictees.
Also Wednesday, the ethnic Albanian parties in the Presevo municipality decided, for the time being, not to take part in the Serbian government's Co-ordination Body for Southern Serbia. 
Belgrade made the offer earlier this month to calm tensions in the area, following the fatal shooting of an ethnic Albanian teenager by Serbian border guards.

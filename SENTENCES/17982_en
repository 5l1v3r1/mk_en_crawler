BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian citizens went to the polls Sunday (January 21st) in the first parliamentary elections held since the breakup of the former federal union with Montenegro.
Latest polls show President Boris Tadic's Democrats in the lead, followed by the ultranationalist Radicals.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who heads the third-ranked Democratic Party of Serbia, has not ruled out forming a coalition with the Radicals, who are still nominally led by Hague war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj.
According to previous data from the Republican Election Commission, there are a total of 6,653,851 eligible voters.
They are choosing from among 3,799 party and coalition candidates.
More than 4,000 accredited Serbian and foreign observers are monitoring the elections, with the majority deployed by OSCE.

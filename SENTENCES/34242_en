THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- One of the UN war crimes tribunal's most wanted suspects, Zeljko Meakic, 38, is expected to appear Monday (7 July) before a judge at The Hague.
Serbia extradited him on Friday, just days after he surrendered to Belgrade police.
Prosecutors say Meakic commanded the infamous Omarska prison camp in northwestern Bosnia in the summer of 1992.
He was charged with five counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, for brutalities committed against Bosnian Muslims and Croat inmates.
He spent eight years in hiding.

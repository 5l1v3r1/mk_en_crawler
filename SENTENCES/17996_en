ANKARA, Turkey -- Despite noteworthy efforts to craft legislation against money laundering, Turkey remains deficient in preventing it, according to a report presented on Monday (March 19th) by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Financial Action Task Force (FATF). 
The report also criticises Turkish authorities for ineffectively implementing the laws. 
Although there were many cases filed before the courts, not one ended in conviction, the report noted. 
FATF experts made several recommendations, including redefining "laundering" in the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering, to make it more concrete and comprehensive.

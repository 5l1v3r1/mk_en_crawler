PRISTINA, Kosovo/BELGRADE, Serbia -- Kosovo submitted a second written statement on the legality of its independence declaration to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday (July 17th), Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni said. 
He told reporters the documentation includes facts and arguments to counter claims that the move was in breach of international law.
"It is logical to expect the court to schedule an oral hearing for February or March next year, and to issue an advisory opinion in three months," professor of international law Tibor Varadi told Belgrade daily Politika.

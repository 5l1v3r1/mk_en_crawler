BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) may call Serbia's local election on February 3rd, to coincide with the possible second round of upcoming presidential elections, B92 reported on Thursday (December 20th).
Asked to comment, Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic of the DS said only that he would comply with the constitution and schedule the local elections before December 31st.
He noted that the government must still forward to parliament some elections-related legislation, and said failing to do so could lead to "a serious legal problem".
On Friday, the DS is expected to officially submit Tadic's nomination to the Serbian Electoral Commission.
Two other candidates' names have been submitted, Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic and Liberal Democratic Party leader Cedomir Jovanovic.
The first round of presidential elections will be held on January 20th.

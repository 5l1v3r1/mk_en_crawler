ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's Judges' and Prosecutors' Association (YARSAV) harshly criticised the government Monday (January 12th) over the ongoing probe into the shadowy secularist group Ergenekon, comparing the situation to "the eras of Hitler and Mussolini". 
The investigation should be objective, not marred by political influence, the association said in a statement. 
"Turkey is not, cannot be and will not be a police state," YARSAV head Omer Faruk Eminagaoglu told a press conference. 
A total of 86 suspected Ergenekon members are currently on trial for allegedly plotting a coup d'etat.
Also Monday, police found another cache of explosives and ammunition allegedly linked to the Ergenekon group. 
Police unearthed hand grenades, smoke bombs and hundreds of rifle bullets in the garden of a house in an Ankara suburb. 
On Saturday, police found a similar cache in an area outside the capital.
In other news Monday, security forces detained 33 people in simultaneous operations against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party in five Turkish provinces: Istanbul, Diyarbakir, Sirnak, Adana and Mersin.

TIRANA, Albania -- International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative in Tirana, Ann-Margret Westin, advised the Albanian government on Friday (December 7th) to raise the price of electricity to reduce the money spent on subsidising the state-run power utility Albanian Electro-Energetic Corporate.
Westin said that if the government does not increase the price of electricity, the IMF will request that the government review the country's 2008 budget and raise taxes.

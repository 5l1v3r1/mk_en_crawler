ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliamentary elections could be held on November 25th, Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks said on Monday (September 17th), though he acknowledged continued uncertainty.
The election must be held 30 to 60 days after parliament is dissolved, which will happen on October 12th.
All the major parties have launched their campaigns.
Polls suggest the Social Democratic Party is in the lead, though the ruling Croatian Democratic Union is not far behind.

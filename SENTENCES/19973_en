SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Political leaders will meet in Sarajevo on Thursday (November 22nd) to discuss the latest developments regarding police and constitutional reforms.
The meeting was called by the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, Haris Silajdzic.
The heads of Serb parties say they will attend, but insisted no police or constitutional reform talks could begin until the present crisis -- involving opposition to new measures from international community envoy Miroslav Lajcak -- is resolved.
The situation in BiH will be discussed by EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday.
Sources say the ministers will draft a statement criticising BiH politicians for leading the country deeper into crisis.

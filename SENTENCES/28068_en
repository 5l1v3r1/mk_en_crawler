ATHENS, Greece -- A UN official said on Wednesday (October 20th) that the EU member states should stop transferring asylum seekers back to Greece under the so-called Dublin II regulation.
"'Greece should not carry the burden of receiving the vast majority of all migrants entering the EU," Manfred Nowak, UN special rapporteur on torture, said as he wrapped up a ten-day fact-finding missions on conditions in immigrant detention facilities.
Under the Dublin II regulation, applications by asylum seekers should be heard in the first EU state they enter.
According to a UN study, about 90% of all detentions took place in Greece this year.
"This is a truly European problem which needs a joint European solution," Nowak said.
He added that asylum seekers in Greece need access to interpreters, medical care and legal aid.
Conditions in police detention facilities across the country are poor, with detainees kept in overcrowded, dirty cells with little ventilation or lighting, he added.

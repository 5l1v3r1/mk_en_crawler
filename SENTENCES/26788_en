LONDON, Great Britain -- Following a meeting Monday (February 8th) with British counterpart Gordon Brown, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said Sofia can count on London's full support in efforts to join the euro zone and attract British investment in several sectors, including energy and tourism.
The two officials also discussed the ongoing blockade by Greek farmers of the border between Greece and Bulgaria, and access to the British labour market by Bulgarians.
Currently, Bulgarian workers don't have free access to this market.
Earlier in the day, Borisov announced that a British investment fund will invest about 50m euros in the construction of a factory building electric cars near Stara Zagora.

TIRANA, Albania -- Senior officials refused on Wednesday (February 2nd) to testify before a parliamentary commission investigating the deadly January 21st opposition protests.
The panel, established immediately after the violence that left three people dead, is composed of only lawmakers from the ruling majority.
President Bamir Topi's office rejected participation saying the president is not allowed to testify in front of parliamentary commissions, courts or the prosecution.
Chief prosecutor Ina Rama refuses to testify, saying "the law forbids giving out details on issues that are under investigation." State Intelligence Service Bahri Shaqiri chief also failed to testify due to "technical reasons".
On Tuesday, both Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Interior Minister Lulzim Basha testified that the opposition was attempting a coup d'Ã©tat.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals judges at the UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (December 16th) denied a request by former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj for provisional release.
He had asked to go home from December 17th - January 14th, as his wife is to give birth in mid-January.
Earlier this month, judges agreed to the request, but the appeals chamber overturned the decision, arguing that Haradinaj might take advantage of his time off to intimidate witnesses.
He is awaiting retrial on charges of murder, torture and cruel treatment of Serbs, Roma and Albanians during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.

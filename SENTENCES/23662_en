TIRANA, Albania -- The Council of Europe (CoE) has called on Albania to complete its investigation of the deadly March 2008 ammunition blasts in Gerdec, media reported on Sunday (January 25th).
The blasts killed 25 people and destroyed more than 300 houses and businesses in the area.
In its annual report, expected for release this week, the CoE says corruption has prevented authorities from compensating those affected by the blasts.
The report also says efforts to investigate and wrap up the case have been insufficient, as corruption and organised crime still threaten Albania's democratic institutions.

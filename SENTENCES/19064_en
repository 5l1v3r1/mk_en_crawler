SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Parliament's (EP) rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey Van Orden, said in Sofia on Tuesday (January 2nd) that the EP might have made a mistake by insisting on the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant units 3 and 4.
They were switched off on the last day of 2006, in line with Sofia's pre-accession agreement with the Union.
According to Van Orden, however, references to Kozloduy are being included as the EU drafts its new energy strategy.
He said Europe must achieve energy independence from Russia and countries in the Middle East.
In this context, he said, the Kozloduy issue might not be fully resolved.

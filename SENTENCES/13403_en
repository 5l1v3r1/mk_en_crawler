PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- A commission investigating Monday's (23 January) train derailment in Montenegro has concluded that human error was to blame.
The derailment killed 44 and injured 198 people.
The commission, appointed by Montenegrin Railways, said on Wednesday that human error, not brake failure as initially believed, caused the train to crash down a rocky ravine near Podgorica.
The train's driver has rejected the finding.

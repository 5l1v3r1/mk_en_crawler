THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The president of the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, Fausto Pocar, is expected to give a positive assessment of the level of co-operation shown by both and Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Leaked portions of an annual report he plans to deliver to the UN Security Council next week appeared in the local media on Monday (October 8th).
They indicate Pocar will note considerable improvement in relations between Serbia and the tribunal after the formation of the new Serbian government in March.
Two war crimes indictees have since been arrested.
As for BiH, Pocar will highlight improved co-operation, especially between the tribunal and Republika Srpska.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministry on Thursday (April 16th) protested a warning issued by the UK's Foreign Office to British tourists visiting Croatia.
The ministry sent a note to the British Embassy in Zagreb demanding an explanation, media reported.
On Wednesday, the BBC published a report citing a Foreign Office warning about "an underlying threat from terrorism and organised crime in Croatia", which sparked angry reactions in Croatia.
"We believe that the text published by BBC is completely vicious and biased," Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic told reporters.
The BBC report cited two high-profile murders in October:
that of journalist Ivo Pukanic and of Ivana Hodak, the daughter of a prominent Croatian lawyer.

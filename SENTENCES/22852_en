TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha has asked the OSCE to limit its presence in the country and to focus only on electoral and judicial reforms, media reported on Wednesday (August 6th).
"Albania has reached a level where it needs to be in charge of processes using the growing professional capacities of Albanian institutions," Basha said in a letter sent to the OSCE in May.
The OSCE, however, insists on completing its full mandate.
In other news, the government adopted a proposal that would give 17,000 policemen raises of 10%.
The proposal would also adjust base salaries according to experience and ability.

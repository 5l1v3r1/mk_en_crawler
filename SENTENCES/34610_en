SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A reputed leader of the Albanian National Army (ANA) on Wednesday (27 August) released uninjured two police officers abducted hours earlier near Kumanovo. 
The policemen, an ethnic Albanian and a Macedonian, were allegedly kidnapped by Avdyl Jakupi, who then demanded the release of an ethnic Albanian accused of setting off a bomb near a school in Kumanovo. 
Jakupi fought for the now disbanded National Liberation Army in 2001 and is thought to be a leading member of the ANA, a shadowy organisation that has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Kosovo, Macedonia and southern Serbia during the past two years.

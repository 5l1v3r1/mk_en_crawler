BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The second, analytical phase of the EU screening process to determine whether Croatia's customs laws are harmonised with Union laws was due to wrap up on Thursday (16 March) in Brussels. 
Martina Dalic, the Croatian negotiator for the Customs Union chapter, says domestic legislation is, to a large extent, already harmonised with EU requirements in this field. 
She noted that once Croatia becomes a EU member, it would take over customs-related responsibilities from Slovenia and Hungary, as it would then constitute a EU external border.

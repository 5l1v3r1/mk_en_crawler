BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian police foiled a plot to help Milorad Ulemek, who assassinated the late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, escape from prison, the daily Vecerne Novosti reported on Saturday (July 19th). 
A criminal group allegedly received 2m euros to ambush a convoy transferring Ulemek, who is serving a life sentence, from the central prison to the court. 
The police obtained the information several months ago and increased security measures. 
They apprehended a suspect in the plot who was reportedly taken into custody after finding explosives and weapons in his apartment.
In other news, the police arrested on Friday a man suspected of threatening to murder Interior Minister Ivica Dacic. 
Dacic, leader of the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS), said on Saturday that his party will sign a declaration on reconciliation with the Democratic Party (DS) by the end of July, Serbian media reported. 
Dacic said the declaration of the SPS and the DS will be "a strategic document that defines what kind of Serbia we want".

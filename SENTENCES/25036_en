BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Court of Appeals on Friday (November 27th) ruled that the dismissal of Dan Nica as interior minister was illegal, leaving the ministry in limbo again. 
The court rejected a decree President Traian Basescu issued two months ago, dismissing Nica, of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), which touched off a political crisis. 
Nica was sacked for comments suggesting there could be fraud in the November presidential elections. 
His PSD withdrew from the cabinet and formed a new alliance with the National Liberal Party, dismissing former Prime Minister Emil Boc's cabinet through a vote of no confidence.
The court's decision can be appealed, but the timing is sensitive, as the interior ministry is the institution that organises Romania's elections. 
Basescu faces the PSD's Mircea Geoana in a run-off for president on Sunday. 
Current Interior Minister Vasile Blaga says he would observe the court ruling and step down, leaving the ministry in the hands of two state secretaries. 
A technical commission will oversee the election, co-ordinated by State Secretary Mihai Capra.

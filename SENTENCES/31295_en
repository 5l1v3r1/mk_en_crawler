SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Montenegrin Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "Monster of Grbavica", refuted as groundless and fabricated all war crimes charges filed against him as his trial opened on Friday (April 29th).
BiH Prosecutor Behaija Krnjic presented the 56 charges of war crimes committed against Bosniaks and Croats in Sarajevo in 1992 and 1993, adding that 105 witnesses will be called to prove the defendant's responsibility for murders, rapes, illegal detention and torture of non-Serb civilians.
Vlahovic was arrested in Spain in March of last year and was handed over to BiH five months later.

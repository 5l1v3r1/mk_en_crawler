ZAGREB, Croatia -- Senior officials on Saturday (14 February) repeated their earlier assertions that war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina must have left the country. 
President Stipe Mesic said Croatian security services would have known if the fugitive general was still in the country. 
He echoed a statement made earlier that day by Deputy Prime Minister Andrija Hebrang. 
"Gotovina is not in Croatia, for if he was I believe we would have some indications and the relevant services would surely have provided us with some intelligence on that," Hebrang told national radio. 
The two leaders appeared to be responding to remarks by chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who says Gotovina is hiding in Croatia. 
The EU has warned Zagreb that its membership bid could hinge on co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

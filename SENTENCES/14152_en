BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Special War Crimes Prosecution on Friday (12 August) officially indicted seven individuals for war crimes committed against Bosniaks in Zvornik, in eastern BiH, in 1992, under a case transferred by The Hague war crimes tribunal to Serbia. 
The seven -- wartime Zvornik Municipal Chief Branko Grujic, Zvornik territorial Defence Staff Chief Branko Popovic and members of the Yellow Hornets paramilitary unit Dusko Vuckovic, Dragan Slavkovic, Ivan Korac, Sinisa Filipovic and Dragutin Dragicevic -- are in custody in Serbia. 
They are facing charges stemming from the murder of at least 19 Muslims at the Celopek Cultural Centre in Zvornik. 
Grujic and Popovic are also indicted with the compulsory expulsion of 1,822 civilians from Zvornik to Hungary. 
The so-called Zvornik case -- handed over from The Hague to Serbia in June 2004 -- was the first case transferred to a national judiciary in the region.

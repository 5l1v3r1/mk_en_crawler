ATHENS, Greece -- Police would extend the scope of their responsibilities, according to draft legislation which the cabinet sent to Parliament on Friday (15 November). 
Among other things, police stations would begin passport-issuing activities no later than June 2004. 
The measure also envisions broadening the powers of the anti-corruption Internal Affairs department.

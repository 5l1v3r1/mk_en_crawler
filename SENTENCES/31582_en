SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government will improve foreign financial assistance co-ordination and maximise the effects of donations, said National Foreign Assistance Co-ordinator Radmila Sekerinska during a presentation Friday (17 January).
"The donors often criticise Macedonia's low absorption power, while the direct users and assistance seekers object to slow and complicated procedures, delays in the allocation of funds and donors' inflexibility," Sekerinska explained.
To change this situation, the government needs to gain the trust of international donors and adjust its policies, she added.
In other news, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski discussed bilateral relations in Belgrade on Friday.
He sealed an agreement on co-operation between respective police forces to better co-ordinate efforts against organised crime.

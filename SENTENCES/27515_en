ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor survived a no-confidence vote early on Thursday (October 28th) following 14 hours of parliamentary debate. 
The motion, by the opposition, was rejected by 79 lawmakers in the 153-seat parliament. 
Only 62 lawmakers voted in favour of it, indicating that the opposition is still far from garnering the support it needs to bring down the government. 
Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who recently returned to parliament as a lawmaker, did not participate in the vote. 
Local media had speculated he would work to bring down the cabinet.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU rule of law mission, EULEX, will not arrest any politicians under investigation during the election campaign, local media reported on Thursday (December 2nd), quoting anonymous sources.
The pact, allegedly struck with Kosovo's leaders, does not mean amnesty for the suspected officials.
EULEX would proceed to indictments and arrest certain politicians suspected of involvement in criminal activities after the final results of elections are announced.
A number of officials, including former cabinet ministers, who are running in the December 12th snap elections are under investigation for corruption and abuse of power.

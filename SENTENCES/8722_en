The biggest snowfall in Southeast Europe in the past three decades has resulted in scores of deaths and hundreds of people hospitalised.
In Romania, two highways and about 30 national roads were closed, while the railway and air traffic suffered significant delays. 
At least 22 died in the country, including four people who froze to death when their cars were caught in snow drifts.
"We have suffered 3m euros in direct losses, which means fuel consumed while blocked on the snow-covered roads," Augustin Hagiu, president of the Romanian Federation of Transport Operators (FORT), told SETimes. 
"An assessment of indirect losses -- deteriorated merchandise or loss of orders due to delays -- takes us to about 20m euros."
In the northwestern town of Knezha, Bulgaria, temperatures plunged to -29 Celsius degrees, breaking a 70-year record there. 
The freezing temperatures have led to a 4% increase in the daily electricity consumption in Bulgaria.
The blizzards, which led to snow drifts of up to 1.5m at places, created traffic problems. 
Heavy snows blocked traffic along the Danube Bridge, linking Bulgaria and Romania, for several days.
Authorities in Sofia set up emergency shelters for the homeless.
Fourteen municipalities in Serbia declared a state of emergency after five people died in temperatures falling to -20 degrees Celsius.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, snowdrifts reached 3m high. 
Dozens of villages remained cut off from main roads, and emergency services are struggling to reach the residents.
Some villages have been without electricity for days, Dejan Cabarkapa, 27, of Han Pijesak told SETimes.
"The food reserves are also getting lower," Cabarkapa said. 
"Emergency services work as much as they can, but they can always do better."
Meteorologists predict the temperature will drop to -25 degrees Celsius next week.

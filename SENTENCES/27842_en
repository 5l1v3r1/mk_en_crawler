TIRANA, Albania -- The Chairman of the European People's Party (EPP) group in the European Parliament (EP), Joseph Daul, reminded politicians in Tirana on Thursday (June 24th) that reforms must continue.
After a meeting with Prime Minister Sali Berisha, Daul said that the EP helped end a parliamentary boycott by the opposition Socialist Party, but cannot dictate legislation.
"Albania needs a democracy that works and therefore an efficient government and opposition.
However, the current opposition, with its obstructive attitude, is not taking its responsibilities seriously and is not contributing to the political and legislative work which is necessary," Daul said.
Berisha confirmed that all opposition requests will be taken into consideration, as parliament needs all lawmakers to pass EU-related legislation.

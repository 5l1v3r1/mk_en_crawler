ATHENS, Greece -- A massive heat wave is expected to hit the Balkan region this week with temperatures rising to 42 degrees Celsius in Greece and 37 degrees Celsius in Romania, meteorologists say.
Greece's National Meteorological Service (EMY) announced on Sunday (July 6th) that the sharp rise in temperatures should start on Tuesday with temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius expected on the Peloponnese peninsula and throughout the islands.
Greece's Electricity Power Corporation is on alert for possible failure of the power system due to overconsumption by air conditioners.
Experts expect power consumption to reach 10,500 MW on Tuesday and Wednesday, nearly reaching last year's record of 10,600 MW.
Romanian meteorologists forecast that Tuesday will be the hottest day of the summer, with temperatures of up to 37 degrees Celsius in Bucharest.
The heat wave stems from warm air from the Mediterranean basin.

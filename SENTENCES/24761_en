SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Constitutional Court on Saturday (July 4th) suspended a law on custom duties that the EU said violated BiH's commitments under the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
Last month, parliament endorsed the bill, which imposes higher customs duties on nearly 1,000 items in a bid to protect domestic production.
The EU, Croatia and Serbia denounced the move, saying it violates BiH's commitments under both the CEFTA accord and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The two neighbours are major exporters to BiH.

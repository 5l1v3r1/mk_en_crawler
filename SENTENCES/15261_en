BUCHAREST, Romania -- The national council tasked with examining Securitate archives ruled on Tuesday (26 September) that President Traian Basescu had not been involved with the Communist-era security services and had not been a member of its political police. 
The issue has been a political hot potato for months. 
Former President Emil Constantinescu repeatedly has accused him of Securitate ties, something Basescu has always denied.

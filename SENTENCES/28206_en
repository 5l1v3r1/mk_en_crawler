ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 15,000 people gathered in Vukovar on Thursday (November 18th) to mark the 19th anniversary of the town's fall into Serb hands and to pay tribute to the civilians and soldiers killed then.
Attending the ceremony were President Ivo Josipovic, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic.
Josipovic said that Vukovar was great in its sacrifice, but also in its ability to forgive.
"Croatia is turning towards its future and the EU," he added.
Serb forces seized Vukovar after a three-month siege, during which about 1,100 civilians were killed and 500 others were taken prisoner in Serbia.
After the town's fall, about 22,000 non-Serbs were expelled.

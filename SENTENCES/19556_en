SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Urgent measures are needed to remove the obstacles hampering prosecution of war crimes suspects, BiH Minister of Justice Barisa Colak told BIRN on Monday (September 24th).
He added that the biggest hurdle is the number of different regulations applied in such proceedings.
"Seventy percent of war crimes verdicts have been pronounced applying one criminal law by local courts, while the Court of BiH has applied a different criminal law," Colak said.
Currently, a total of five criminal codes are applied in court cases involving war crimes suspects, each offering different definitions of criminal offences and different punishments.
In light of this, 30 defendants at the state Court of BiH are staging a hunger strike demanding they be tried under more lenient terms that were in place when their alleged crimes were committed.

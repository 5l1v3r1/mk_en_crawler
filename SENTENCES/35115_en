Tan acknowledged that the deployment of the International Security Assistance Force (IASF) outside Kabul needs reinforcements, but noted thatTurkey led the IASF for eight months last year and has already sent a nine-member delegation to participate in the construction of Kabul Airport. 
Ankara also will be dispatching three helicopters to Afghanistan, as previously agreed. 
At this stage, Tan said, the government does not intend to reinforce the provincial improvement teams outside Kabul.

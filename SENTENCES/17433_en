BUDAPEST, Hungary -- NATO and EU will have to recognize Kosovo independence if the new talks for future Kosovo status fail, Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said Monday (July 30th).
The province needs an urgent answer in case the 120 days of negotiations fail, and the best solution would be joint action from EU and NATO, he said.
The prime minister also expressed his pessimism about Russian assistance in finding an agreeable solution.
The EU should not expect Moscow to change its position on Kosovo, he said.

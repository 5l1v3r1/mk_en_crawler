SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A Bulgarian soldier was killed in Iraq on Friday (23 April) when his patrol came under mortar and automatic fire. 
He became the sixth Bulgarian military casualty since Sofia dispatched 500 troops to Iraq last summer. 
The government held an urgent meeting later Friday to discuss additional measures to strengthen troop security. 
The government insists the troops will fulfil their mandate in Iraq.
On Saturday, Foreign Minister Solomon Passy called for the UN to play a more active role there, adding that Sofia eventually wants to see power given to the Iraqi authorities and elections held.
In other news, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said during a visit to Italy that his country was prepared to increase its number of troops in Iraq to 100 or 200. 
Tirana now has 71 soldiers in Mosul, under Italian command.

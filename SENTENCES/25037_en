NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The state-run Cyprus Broadcasting Station (CYBC) reported on Sunday (November 29th) that Britain is downgrading one of its two military bases in Cyprus.
According to the report, several hundred troops at the Dekelia base in Larnaca have returned to the UK, while a smaller number were relocated to the second British base in Cyprus, in Akrotiri.
The report cited British military and Cypriot government sources.
The decision to downsize reportedly was made both for economic and security reasons.

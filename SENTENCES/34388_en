BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre Richard Prosper visited Belgrade on Monday (20 October) and said the extradition of war crimes indictee General Ratko Mladic would determine whether Serbia-Montenegro is allowed to prosecute such cases in local courts.
"I hope that people in Serbia have decided once and for all that the problem of war crimes must be left behind them," said Prosper.
Belgrade insists it lost all contact with Mladic more than a year ago.

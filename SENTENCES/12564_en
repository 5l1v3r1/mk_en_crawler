SOFIA, Bulgaria -- After consultations among the ruling coalition partners, the opposition and President Georgi Parvanov, parliament on Wednesday (6 April) finally approved changes to electoral legislation.
The measures introduce participation deposits, to be paid by parties in the next parliamentary elections.
The amount of the deposits, about 10,000 euros, is about half the figure initially sought by the ruling NMS-II.
In other news, the foreign ministry confirmed Wednesday that Bulgaria would introduce a visa regime for neighbouring Macedonia, starting on 1 January 2007.
This is in line with obligations stemming from Bulgaria's future membership in the EU.
On Thursday, meanwhile, Parvanov will host Serbian President Boris Tadic, who is making his first official visit to Bulgaria.

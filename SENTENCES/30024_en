PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo authorities requested on Thursday (May 19th) that European Commission representatives be more proactive on the issue of visa liberalisation.
Kosovo has met all technical requirements, Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said at a meeting of the working group on visa liberalisation with the EU.
Separately Thursday, a European Parliament delegation headed by Eduard Kukan met with Kosovo's leadership.
President Atifete Jahjaga asked members to help Kosovo on its road to EU integration, while Prime Minister Hashim Thaci stressed that Kosovo has approved the law on repatriation, the re-integration strategy, and 3.5m euros for the re-integration process.
On Friday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele visit Kosovo.
Barroso is expected to call on Kosovo institutions to implement requirements stemming from the latest progress report, as well as concrete reforms.
This way, the next report, due in November, can cite progress, he said.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU and US participants in the two-day regional summit on energy, investments and economic development in Dubrovnik said in a joint statement on Friday (July 10th) the Western Balkan countries should join the EU and NATO. 
They stressed Western Balkan countries' progress must be acknowledged to keep citizens' "euro-enthusiasm" alive. 
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, said the Western Balkans can count on the EU's support.

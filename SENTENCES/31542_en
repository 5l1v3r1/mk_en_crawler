ATHENS, Greece -- The panel of judges that will review the "17 November" case is to be appointed on 3 February, according to the Athens City Court. 
Judges and prosecutors will be selected by draw behind closed doors to avoid any hint of corruption. 
The terrorist organisation "17 November" is charged with blackmailing top Greek officials. 
Authorities are also investigating ties between the group and some Greek businessmen, who allegedly financed terrorist activities. 
The court has already summoned for questioning Marianna Latsis, daughter of the influential ship owner Giannis Latsis.

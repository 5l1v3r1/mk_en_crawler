TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) reportedly have overcome differences regarding key electoral reform. 
An agreement signed on Wednesday (30 August) calls for the elimination of the temporary voter registry, and for the number of members in the Central Electoral Commission to go from 7 to 9, allowing smaller parties to gain representation.

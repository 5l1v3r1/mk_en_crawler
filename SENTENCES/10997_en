BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Wednesday's (29 June) raids on facilities owned by Bosnian Serb businessman Slavko Roguljic in Banja Luka were based on relevant information that could prove useful in the future, said EUFOR Lieutenant Colonel Simon West, who led the operation. 
EUFOR, NATO and Republika Srpska (RS) police conducted the raids jointly. 
According to West, the operation targeted war crimes indictees' network of supporters rather than specific individuals. 
RS police say the raids turned up some illegally possessed weapons and two stolen cars. 
Roguljic has been blacklisted by the EU and the United States for allegedly helping indictee Radovan Karadzic avoid capture.

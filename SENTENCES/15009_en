SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry announced on Wednesday (1 March) that Sofia would host a two-day informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers, beginning on 27 April.
In all, the 26 foreign ministers of NATO member states, the Pact's Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, and 800 other guests are expected to attend.
Also Wednesday, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov spoke by phone with Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.
The two reportedly expressed a mutual desire to overcome bilateral disputes, particularly the issue of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death on allegations -- widely disputed outside Libya -- of infecting patients with HIV.
In other news Wednesday, engineers turned off one of Bulgaria's four reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant because of a pump failure.
Experts said one of the newer 1,000-megawatt units was affected by a shutoff of its main coolant pump.
There was no danger of radiation since there were three other pumps acting as backups.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Monday (May 10th) that an agreement has been reached to hold next month's EU-Western Balkans conference in Sarajevo as an informal meeting.
Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Moratinos said all sides have agreed to participate in the forum under the so-called Gymnich format, which will allow representatives of both Serbia and Kosovo to attend.
The Gymnich format stipulates that participants are identified without flags or other state trappings.
Serbia has balked at attending events with Kosovo leaders, saying it implies recognition of the former province's independence.

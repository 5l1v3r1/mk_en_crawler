BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade on Thursday (March 4th) handed down a 15-month prison sentence to a man who threatened a popular journalist over her reports on football hooliganism in Serbia.
Stefan Hadziantonovic was found guilty of threatening Brankica Stankovic via Facebook.
Hadziantonovic pleaded guilty and apologised.
Stankovic, who works for B92, received numerous threats recently after reporting on fans suspected in hooligan attacks, including the September murder of French football fan Brice Taton in Belgrade.

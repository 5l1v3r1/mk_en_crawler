ANKARA, Turkey -- More than 100 members of Turkey's intellectual elite signed a declaration Saturday (March 1st) calling on the government to speed up EU-related reforms.
"There have been expectations on the part of Turkish society for more reforms, but the government does not seem to be inclined to meet these expectations," said the statement, which was published in the monthly magazine Kriter.
It added that EU membership would guarantee secular democracy and stability.
"We expect you to take concrete measures and to make up for lost time," the declaration concluded.

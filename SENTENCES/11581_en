ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday (23 March) that the government would meet all requirements for signing a new stand-by arrangement with the IMF on time. 
At a news conference, Erdogan dismissed concerns that Turkey would fail to fulfil set measures, particularly regarding legislative adjustments. 
He noted that new bills related to the taxation system reform have been discussed by parliament, while a new social security draft would be submitted soon. 
The new IMF agreement is worth a total of $10 billion.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced Sunday (19 January) that former monarch Constantine would be allowed to visit Athens during the Summer Olympics in 2004.
Constantine is banned from travel with a Greek passport until he removes the title "king" from his name and adopts a family name.
However, the ousted Greek monarch is also member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is thus entitled, under the organisation's agreements with Greece, to be present during the games.
IOC Secretary General Jacques Rogge commented that the Games might provide an occasion for reconciliation between Constantine and Greek authorities.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- NATO has conducted a surprise inspection of the Bulgarian air force, as part of an operation involving several NATO member states, according to an announcement by Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov on Tuesday (December 5th).
He said the inspection took place two weeks ago and was aimed at assessing the military's readiness to counter an unknown aircraft trying to enter Bulgarian air space.
According to Bliznakov, the air force performed successfully.
In other news, after weeks of debate, parliament finally adopted on Wednesday a law that allows the unveiling of files belonging to the Communist era-security services.
Despite pressure from the opposition for full disclosure, the ruling Socialists managed to push through a partial restriction:
the files of senior intelligence officers that are or have been involved with intelligence agencies since 1991 will remain confidential.

SHKODER, Albania -- The repeat local elections in the Vau i Dejes municipality failed Sunday (14 December). 
Official sources said commissioners of the opposition Democratic Party refused to appear at three of the polling stations, protesting the change of commissioners representing the ruling Socialist Party and the Social Democrat Party. 
The three polling stations were in the villages of Mjede, Narac and Shelqet. 
This was the third attempt to elect a mayor of the Vau i Dejes municipality. 
Votes failed on 12 October and 16 November, again due to a boycott by Democratic Party commissioners.

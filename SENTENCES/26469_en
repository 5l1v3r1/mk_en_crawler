SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A parliamentary committee looking into the February 2004 death of President Boris Trajkovski said on Monday (January 11th) that the investigation must continue.
Trajkovski was killed in a plane crash in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Commission President Oliver Sambevski said a report will be submitted to parliament citing discrepancies in initial information.
Reportedly, it took 26 hours to find the wreckage while Bosnian police and rescue crews claim they had been prevented from reaching the site.
About18 seconds of cockpit conversation is allegedly missing from the plane's black box recorder.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The validation of personnel granted access to classified information from NATO will be completed by April 2004, according to government officials quoted by the state news agency Rompres on Thursday (6 November). 
The terms of the procedure are in the national plan for NATO membership for the period 2003-2004, approved during a cabinet session earlier this week. 
The document calls for personnel in steady communication with NATO to be carefully scrutinised. 
The Romanian intelligence services already have reorganised their structure and activities in line with NATO standards.

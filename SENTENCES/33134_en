BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic said late Monday (16 June) that he is willing to sign a limited reciprocal agreement preventing the extradition of citizens to the International Criminal Court.
The agreement, however, would be time-sensitive:
it would depend on the speed at which the country moves towards EU integration.
Marovic said his country does not want to affect its chances for EU integration.

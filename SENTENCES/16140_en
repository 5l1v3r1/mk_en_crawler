ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc suggested on Saturday (12 August) that the 10 per cent election threshold in the country is too high, particularly as regards the election of independent deputies. 
Senior officials with the ruling Justice and Development Party have implied that the 10 per cent election threshold should be lowered, following warnings from the EU that it affects representation.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriots headed for the polls on Sunday (17 April) to elect President Rauf Denktash's successor.
Polls give pro-unity candidate and current Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat a huge lead over nationalist candidates, including Dervis Eroglu, of the opposition National Unity Party.
Talat is projected to win 60 per cent of the vote.
On Friday, he called on the EU to push the Greek Cypriots to agree to reopen reunification talks.
He told reporters that he hopes to complete the negotiations by 3 October, when Turkey is due to start its EU accession process.
The issue of Cyprus remains a sticking point between Brussels and Ankara.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Baltimore wrapped up a two-day forum Thursday (March 24th) of political and business leaders from the Western Balkans, organised by the state of Maryland on behalf of the US administration. 
The event brought together about 400 representatives of Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo and Slovenia, who discussed ways to boost investments and strengthen business co-operation with the US. 
Serbia refused to participate in the forum due to Kosovo's participation as an independent state.

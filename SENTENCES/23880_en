ATHENS, Greece -- A homemade bomb exploded late on Wednesday (March 18th) in front of the office of Kiriyakos Mitsotakis, a member of the ruling New Democracy party. 
It caused property damage but no injuries. 
Mitsotakis, 41, brother of Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and son of former Prime Minister Costas Mitsotakis, was not in the office at the time, nor was anyone else. 
A group calling itself Revolutionary Liberation Action claimed responsibility on Thursday.

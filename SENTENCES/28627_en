PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition parties say that early elections would be a better option than maintaining the current government coalition.
They blame strained relations between the government and international personnel, such as EULEX and the International Civilian Office.
EULEX personnel recently raided Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications offices as part of an anti-corruption investigation.

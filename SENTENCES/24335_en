ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chances of a smooth and easy resolution of the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia, even with the support of the European Commission (EC), seemed slim following the first round of negotiations Wednesday (March 11th). 
Talks included the foreign ministers of the two countries and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn. 
Slovenia views EC mediation as the key to resolving the dispute, while Croatia insists that the EU should only prepare the case for arbitration by the International Court of Justice.

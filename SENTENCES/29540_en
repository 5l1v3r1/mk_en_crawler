ATHENS, Greece -- The government threatened on Thursday (September 30th) to jail protesting truck owners who refuse to return to work. 
It sent a bill to parliament that envisions up to three years in prison for those who violate the back-to-work order. 
It also threatens to suspend or revoke operating licenses. 
Late Thursday, union leaders decided to halt nearly three weeks of protests against government plans to liberalise their sector, reportedly in part due to the bill. 
The strikers began pulling their trucks off main roads Friday. 
According to some estimates, the strike racked up business losses of about 1.5 billion euros.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met for two hours on Monday (November 2nd) to further discuss reunification of the divided island. 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special adviser for Cyprus, Alexander Downer, said the focus was on property, which will be the subject again when they meet on Thursday.
Separately, Christofias met on Monday with former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is making a private visit to Cyprus. 
Boutros-Ghali expressed confidence that there will be a solution to the long-standing issue on the island, and stressed that past failures should not bring the process to a halt. 
"There is never such a thing as a last chance," he said.

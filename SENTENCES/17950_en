ISTANBUL, Turkey -- An apartment building collapsed in Istanbul early on Wednesday (February 21st) killing one woman and injuring 26 others. 
Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said at least 27 people lived in the building, which had been slated for demolition. 
Some media reports say the five-story structure was heavily damaged in a 1999 earthquake, while others suggest that adjacent construction might have weakened the building's foundations.

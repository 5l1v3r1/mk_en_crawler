ZAGREB, Croatia -- A judge from Zagreb's County Court on Wednesday (March 31st) ordered a one-month detention for former Economy Minister Damir Polancec. 
The move is aimed at preventing the defendant from influencing witnesses. 
Polancec was arrested on Tuesday as part of an investigation into financial wrongdoings by the local food producer Podravka, where he worked before joining the government.
In other news, a survey conducted by the GfK agency -- marking Croatia's first anniversary as a NATO member -- shows that the majority of Croats support membership and the participation of Croatian soldiers in missions abroad. 
According to the survey, 64.6% of respondents said they feel secure living in a NATO member country; 62.6% believe that the Alliance and its enlargement are important to regional security and stability. 
The survey was conducted in February among 750 people.

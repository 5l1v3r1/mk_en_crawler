ANKARA, Turkey -- The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) decided on Wednesday (April 22nd) to stage a sit-in at parliament protesting the recent waves of arrests of DTP members for suspected links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), media reported on Thursday.
"We want to show that the right place for solving [the Kurdish issue] is parliament," said Selahattin Demirtas, deputy chairman of the DTP's parliamentary group.
Over the last two weeks, police arrested dozens of DTP members, including high-ranking officials, as part of a large-scale operation against the PKK.
Demirtas says the operations are "politically motivated", following gains the party made in the local elections last month.
In other news, media reported on Friday that authorities are investigating the country's security forces after watching video footage of a 12-year-old Kurdish boy being severely beaten during a demonstration.
The video, shot during a pro-Kurdish demonstration Thursday in the southeastern province of Hakkari, shows a special unit officer beating the boy in the head with a truncheon and kicking him as he lies on the ground.
His superiors suspended the officer.

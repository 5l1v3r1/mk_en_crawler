NEW YORK, United States -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged international mediators on Tuesday (September 22nd) to try to resolve the long-standing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"The OSCE's Minsk Group has an important role in contributing to the improvement of the relations with Armenia," Erdogan said in New York, where he is participating in the 64th session of the UN General Assembly.
Ankara is working to open its long-sealed border with Armenia by the end of this year and establish diplomatic ties with Yerevan.
Resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict would contribute to better ties between the two countries.
Talks on the future of Nagorno-Karabakh, mediated by the Minsk Group, have dragged on for a decade.
Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993 as a gesture of solidarity with Azerbaijan.

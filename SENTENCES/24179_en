NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat said on Monday (April 13th) he hopes a peace plan to reunify the divided island will go before Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot voters in a double referendum early next year.
So far, Talat and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias have refused to set a specific time frame for ending ongoing negotiations or for holding a possible referendum.
"However, the level we have reached in the direct talks points to the opening of a new stage and a new course, which also comprises a referendum," Talat told a conference at a Turkish Cypriot university.
In 2004, a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general at the time, failed to win the approval of Greek Cypriot voters in a referendum held on both parts of the island.

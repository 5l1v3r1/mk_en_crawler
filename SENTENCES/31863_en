LA CORUÃ'A, Spain -- The captain of the oil tanker Prestige, which spilled a considerable amount of oil in the Biscaya Bay in Spain on 17 November, pleaded not guilty Monday (30 December).
Apostolos Mangouras, 67, says the storm that day was one of the worst in his 44-year career.
Mangouras says he did his duty and denies the maneuvers he ordered led to the accident.
He remains in custody at a La CoruÃ±a prison, after the judge set bail at 3m euros.
The spill caused an ecological catastrophe in the bay.
In response, Athens vowed to improve maritime safety during its presidency of the EU, which began Wednesday.

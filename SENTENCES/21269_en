BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Edi Rama, leader of Albania's opposition Socialist Party (SP), said on Monday (April 28th) that Albania should use the momentum gained from its recent invitation to join NATO and apply for EU candidate country status this fall. 
In Brussels, he said "Albania has lost too much time in years because of a divisive political scene that benefited the politicians and held the people hostage."
Also Monday, the leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), Ilir Meta, sent a letter to Rama declaring his readiness to join a "new union" initiated by Rama. 
Meta urged him to revise recent amendments to the constitution drafted by the SP and the ruling Democratic Party.

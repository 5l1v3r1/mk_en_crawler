ATHENS, Greece -- The citizen protection ministry plans to use huge ships in an effort to deal with the number of illegal migrants caught on Greece's territory, local media reported on Wednesday (January 5th).
Two ships, currently at a port in Rotterdam, are outfitted to provide long-term housing for 1,000 people each and will operate as sailing centres for migrants.
Dutch police use the vessels as a temporary detention facility for foreigners found to be illegally staying around Rotterdam.
A delegation from the Greek government is expected in The Netherlands soon to discuss renting the ships.
At the same time, the government plans to transform three old military barracks in the Evros region into migrant housing facilities.
Greece has also announced controversial plans to build a fence along its border with Turkey, in a bid to stem the immigrant flow.

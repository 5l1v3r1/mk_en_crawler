SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission (EC) has requested that all payments to Bulgaria under the PHARE programme be suspended, at least temporarily, the finance ministry announced on Friday (February 29th). 
At issue are suspected misappropriation and fraud in relation to the programme, requiring a thorough inspection by the finance ministry. 
This is the second such request in less than a month. 
Payments under the ISPA programme were suspended due to recent corruption allegations involving the state roads fund.

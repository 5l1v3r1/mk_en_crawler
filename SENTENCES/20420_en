TIRANA, Albania -- The country's agency for protecting competition announced on Monday (November 12th) that it has fined Albania's two mobile phone operators a total of 3.8m euros for price fixing. 
Albanian Mobile Communications (AMC) and Vodafone Albania are accused of abusing their monopoly positions to overcharge customers. 
The agency found that both operators set their prices much higher than the EU and regional averages in 2004 and 2005. 
AMC is owned by the Greek-Norwegian company CosmoteTelenor and, along with Vodafone, has a total of more than 2 million subscribers. 
A Turkish company that bought Albania's telecom earlier this year will launch a third GSM operator in 2008.

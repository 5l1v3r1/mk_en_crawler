THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- US special war crimes envoy Pierre-Richard Prosper said Thursday (16 December) that prosecuting Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic at The Hague is the only option on the table.
His statement was in response to media speculation about a supposed offer to hold trials for the two in Serbia.
The head of Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, also denied the reports.
In other news Thursday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica met with EU security chief Javier Solana and assured him that Serbia would meet its obligations to the tribunal.

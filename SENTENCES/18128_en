BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Constitutional Court has in essence agreed that former international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown violated the human rights of two former Republika Srpska (RS) officials when he ordered their removal from office -- without recourse -- in 2004. 
Former RS Parliament Speaker Dragan Kalinic, who was chairman of the Serb Democratic Party, and former RS Intelligence Agency chief Milorad Bilbija were banned from any public or elected office, amid suspicions they were helping war crimes indictees evade justice. 
They appealed the decision to the high court. 
Their lawyer, Miljkan Puchar, says the two may seek compensation from the state.

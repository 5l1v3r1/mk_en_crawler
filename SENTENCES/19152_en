NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Friday (June 29th) officially confirmed and welcomed the appointment of Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajcak as the new high representative and EU special representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He was endorsed by the Peace Implementation Council's steering board last month.
In an interview with the Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avaz at the weekend, Lajcak cited constitutional and police reforms as the two top priorities, warning that their implementation should be no longer delayed.
Lajcak also said he was worried about the deterioration of the political situation in BiH, and cautioned that he would not tolerate any obstructions during his mandate.

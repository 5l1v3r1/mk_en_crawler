ATHENS, Greece -- Taxi drivers plan to begin a strike Monday (15 December) protesting a government requirement to install cash registers in their vehicles. 
The requirement takes effect in January. 
A meeting with representatives of the finance ministry and the PASOK Central Committee is scheduled for Monday. 
If no breakthrough is achieved, however, Athens cabbies will walk off their jobs for an undefined period of time.

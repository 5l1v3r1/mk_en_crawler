ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis warned that there would be consequences if the two Cypriot communities reject the UN plan for the reunification of the island during referenda to be held on 24 April. 
"If either the Greek or Turkish Cypriot communities reject the plan there will be no new initiative for a solution for a long time," he said in an interview published Sunday (4 April). 
His comments followed the release of a new poll that found more than 90 per cent of Greek Cypriots oppose the plan. 
In the northern part of the island, a local television station reported that 51 per cent of Turkish Cypriots would support the UN plan in the upcoming referendum. 
If it is not adopted, only the Greek part of the island will join the EU on 1 May.

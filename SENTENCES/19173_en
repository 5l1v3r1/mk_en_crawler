ANKARA, Turkey -- The World Council of Churches (WCC) issued a statement on Thursday (August 30th) accusing Turkey of making it difficult for followers of other faiths to practice their religions. 
The WCC backed Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew in his battles with the Turkish courts over the use of the title "ecumenical". 
The Armenian and Syrian Orthodox Churches, the council said, were also subject to restrictions. 
It noted recent attacks on Christians, including the murder of three missionaries in April.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov broke his silence Wednesday (September 15th) on France's controversial effort to expel thousands of Roma back to Bulgaria and Romania.
"I find this group repatriation not normal," said Parvanov, a member of the left-wing Bulgarian Socialist Party.
The expulsion policy, he added, does not "set a good European tone".
His position contrasts with that of the GERB-led government.
In Brussels on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov said Sofia does not view the "repatriation of Bulgarian citizens of Roma descent as a mass deportation and violation of human rights".

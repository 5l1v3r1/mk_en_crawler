SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said on Monday (June 30th) he may initiate a referendum on introducing a majority voting element to the electoral system. 
He urged parliament to schedule a referendum on the issue and suggested that he might launch a petition to that end. 
Parvanov has previously suggested that a limited number of MPs -- possibly 30 out of 240 -- could win seats through a majority vote. 
Another proposal he backs would introduce preferential voting, which would allow voters to rearrange the order of candidates on party tickets.
In other news Monday, Interior Minister Mihail Mikov said he wants to implement deep restructuring that would optimise the work of security agencies and enable a more efficient fight against crime and corruption. 
Meeting with the Confederation of Employers and Industrialists in Bulgaria, Mikov called for better organisation of interior ministry staff, adding that this does not necessarily mean layoffs. 
He conceded public trust in police is not high but said restructuring might change that.

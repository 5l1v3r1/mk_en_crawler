NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish and Greek Cypriots reached an agreement Monday (27 January) on amendments to the peace plan proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
The revision covers most of the objections raised by the two sides. 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash remains unconvinced and lashed out at Turkish ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan for suggesting Denktash does not want a settlement. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis visited the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" Monday, yet seemed pessimistic that a final agreement would be reached by the UN's 28 February deadline.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Friday (December 14th) that Albania will open its borders to Kosovars if Serbia imposes an economic embargo on the province after it declares its independence.
Serbia could make some decisions that may create economic difficulties for the citizens of Kosovo after the province declares independence, Berisha said.
"The government in Tirana will mobilise its whole capacity so that the Kosovars could use Albanian infrastructure and have access to Albanian ports." (AFP, Fena - 14/12/07)

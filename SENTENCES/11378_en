TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties have criticised Prime Minister Fatos Nano's annual report on the work of the government last year, saying the document paints an unrealistic picture of the situation.
The opposition particularly disagreed with Nano's claim that 2004 was the most successful year of Albania's transition, arguing that major social problems remain unsolved and that the government lacks a real strategy for developing priority sectors of the economy.

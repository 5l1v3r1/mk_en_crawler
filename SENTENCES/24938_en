PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Describing the situation in Kosovo as very peaceful, KFOR Commander Giuseppe Emilio Gay says he expected no unrest similar to that which erupted last spring and in March 2004. 
In an interview with the Pristina-based newspaper Koha Ditore on Saturday (February 28th), Gay said "People want to work and don't want to follow any hardlines." (Koha Ditore, Makfax, MIA - 28/02/09)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament ratified the arbitration border agreement Friday (November 20th) aimed at resolving the long-standing border dispute with Slovenia.
Ratifications required a two-thirds majority.
In the end, most representatives of the main opposition Social Democratic Party supported the agreement, despite some reservations.
On Thursday, the Slovenian government approved a plan to make the agreement with Croatia subject to a nonbinding public referendum, before parliament ratifies it.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition Croatian Christian Democratic Union (HKDU) has requested a referendum on whether to hand over Gen Janko Bobetko to the UN war crimes tribunal.
HKDU leader Anto Kovacevic criticised the government's strategy of delaying Bobetko's arrest on the grounds of poor health.Other indictees, including Gen Ante Gotovina and Rahim Ademi, could not be defended in the same way, Kovacevic said.

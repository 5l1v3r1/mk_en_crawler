YEREVAN, Armenia -- Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian accused Turkey on Friday (January 22nd) of trying to block the development of diplomatic ties and the opening of the common border between the two countries.
The statement came after Ankara rejected a ruling by the Armenian Constitutional Court, the body that approves protocols to establish formal diplomatic relations.
"If Turkey is not ready to ratify the protocols, if it continues to speak the language of putting preconditions and blocking the process, then I am not ruling out a similar development," Nalbandian said.

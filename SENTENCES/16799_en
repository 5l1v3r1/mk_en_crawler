BUCHAREST, Romania -- Border police have prevented two sons of Omar Hayssam -- the missing Syrian-born businessman accused of masterminding the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq last year -- from leaving the country, according to media reports Friday (4 August). 
The two allegedly were stopped at the international airport in Bucharest before they boarded a plane bound for Damascus. 
Romanian authorities have issued an international arrest warrant for Hayssam, who vanished after his temporary release from custody for medical treatment. 
The scandal led to the resignations of the chiefs of the Romanian security and intelligence structures.

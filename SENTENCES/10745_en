TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers from the ruling Socialist Party voted against a government-backed motion to strip an opposition deputy of his immunity from prosecution.
Christian Democratic Party lawmaker Nikoll Lesi, who is also editor-in-chief of the daily Koha Jone, is charged with libeling Prime Minister Fatos Nano's wife.
He accused her of engaging in illegal business operations with the support of her husband.
Nano urged his lawmakers to waive Lesi's immunity, but only 62 out of 137 deputies present in parliament backed the motion.
In other news Monday, the defence ministry announced plans to boost participation in peacekeeping missions worldwide in 2005.
Defence Minister Pandeli Majko discussed the issue at a meeting with counterparts from Southeast Europe last week in Ljubljana.

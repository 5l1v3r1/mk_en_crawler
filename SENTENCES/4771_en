The government moved last month to stem a tide of bank withdrawals from customers seeking higher deposit insurance levels abroad. 
Bank accounts will now be insured up to 25,000 euros, up from the previous 5,400 euros.
According to Prime Minister Sali Berisha, the initiative will protect around 80% of the nation's bank accounts.
"Here they will find a safe shelter for their money," Berisha said, urging Albanians at home and abroad to keep their savings in Albanian banks
More than 900,000 emigrants work abroad, mainly in Italy and Greece. 
Because those countries had higher maximum levels of deposit insurance, emigrants have had little incentive to rely on Albanian banks.
The global economic crisis has compounded the problem further, with a growing number of anxious depositors choosing to withdraw their money. 
Late last year, experts began urging authorities to raise the deposit insurance levels.
Between the end of September and mid-December of last year, around 8% of deposits were reportedly withdrawn. 
According to Reuters, total deposits nationwide fell from 5.1 billion euros in September 2008 to 4.7 billion euros at the end of the year.
The Bank of Albania insists that, despite the withdrawals, the country's banking system is not in danger.
"These withdrawals made up a small part of commercial banks' balance sheets and did not affect the banking system's soundness," Governor Ardian Fullani said.

ROME, Italy -- President Giorgio Napolitano says his recent dispute with Croatian counterpart Stipe Mesic is completely resolved, following a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit meeting in the Czech Republic.
Napolitano told Italy's RAI TV at the weekend that he and Mesic exchanged views and agreed to put the matter behind them.
In February, bilateral relations grew strained after Napolitano referred to crimes committed by Tito's partisans against Italians in Croatia during WWII.
Mesic, in turn, accused Napolitano of racism.
After a brief period of tension, the two sides cooled down and said they would not seek to revise post WWII-era treaties, which had resolved all outstanding issues on war crimes and related events between the two countries.
Zagreb and Rome have also expressed their readiness to continue dialogue and partnership, both political and economic.

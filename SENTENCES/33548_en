ZAGREB, Croatia -- Two right-centre opposition parties -- the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and the Democratic Centre (DC) -- have agreed to form a pre-election coalition.
HSLS leader Drazen Budisa and DC leader Mate Granic held a joint news conference Saturday (20 September) and announced that their parties, after several tries, have finally reached an agreement and will enter the race for parliamentary elections together in late November.
Budisa predicts the deal could result in 20 to 25 seats in the next parliament, broadening the parties' possible role in forming post-election coalition agreements.
In other news, Deputy Prime Minister Zeljka Antunovic, who chairs the government's commission for gender equality, presented a report Friday noting progress in the elimination of discrimination against women in the country.
According to the document, which was introduced during a roundtable with local NGOs, significant results have been achieved lately in terms of institutional mechanisms aimed at protecting gender equality.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu of the Democratic Party (PD) described various scenarios Tuesday (October 2nd) depending on the outcome of Wednesday's no confidence vote against the cabinet.
Should it pass, he said, the result could be a coalition government consisting of the PD, the National Liberal Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, with a prime minister from the PD.
According to Basescu, a second scenario would be a unity government that includes most parties in parliament, including the opposition Social Democratic Party, which filed the motion.
A third scenario would be early elections.
Right now, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's cabinet controls only 20% of the seats in parliament.

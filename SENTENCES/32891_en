SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Constitutional Court President Kasim Trnka said Thursday (6 February) that the appointment of Ahmed Hadzipasic as BiH Federation Prime Minister would be a breach of the constitution.
He explained that, by law, members of one constituent nation could not occupy more than two leading posts.
Amir Jaganjac, who is also a Bosniak, has already been appointed BiH Supreme Court President.
The new president of the Federation of BiH, Niko Lozancic, rejected Trnka's statement, insisting that that Hadzipasic's appointment would be valid.
The House of Representatives is expected to approve the nomination of the new government on Friday.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik said on Saturday (February 12th) that he feels Germany sincerely wants to help Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
He made this statement in Banja Luka upon returning from Berlin where he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday. 
"Mrs Merkel expressed her wish to help the Euro-Atlantic integration of the region," Dodik said. 
At the same time, he rejected the EU's stance that BiH must change its constitution to strengthen the central government at the expense of the two regional entities.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has started exhuming bodies in 12 locations in a bid to identify about 2,000 people missing since the 1999 conflict, EULEX spokeswoman Kristiina Herodes said on Saturday (May 2nd). 
Ten bodies will undergo analysis at the Office of Missing Persons and Forensics. 
EULEX said it cannot reveal the exact locations until the cases are sent to the prosecutor's office.
In other news, assailants threw stones and Molotov cocktails at a Romanian EULEX police convoy in the town of Mitrovica late on Thursday, media reported on Friday. 
The police patrol was on its way the Serb-dominated northern part of Mitrovica to take over its assignments, Police Chief Milija Milosevic said. 
There were no injuries, and the vehicles suffered no major damage, he added.
Meanwhile on Friday, EULEX police fired tear gas to disperse nearly 200 ethnic Serbs gathered for a seventh day in the village of Brdjani near Mitrovica to protest the reconstruction of seven Albanian houses.

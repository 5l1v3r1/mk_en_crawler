PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government on Thursday (August 26th) pledged to extend 13m euros to municipalities run by Kosovo Serbs.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci promised to provide 5m euros for capital investment in Serb-dominated municipalities run by parallel structures in the north, and another 8m euros to newly created municipalities that resulted from elections.
Thaci said the funding is a necessity to strengthen state functioning.
A day earlier, the government pledged 5m euros in capital investments to the divided town of Mitrovica.
Belgrade's representatives in Kosovo say the funding is an attempt to buy support from Serbs who refuse to recognise Kosovo's independence.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Turkish consortium of Koc Holding and Turk Telekom and Bulgaria's Privatisation Agency signed a preliminary contract Friday (18 July) on the sale of 65 per cent of Bulgarian Telecom Company (BTC). 
The deadline for the completion of talks with the Turkish investors expired Friday. 
The consortium has proposed to invest 680m euros in BTC. 
But the other candidate, Viva Ventures, says the signing was a breach of contract. 
Viva Ventures was chosen earlier to buy BTC, but the privatisation agency rescinded the deal. 
Investors appealed that decision, and the Supreme Administrative Court will now have the final say on the issue.

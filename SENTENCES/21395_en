THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Kosovo journalist Baton Haxhiu told The Hague war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (June 25th) that he is innocent of all charges against him. 
He faces charges of revealing the name of a protected witness in the trial of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
It appeared in an article published in the Pristina-based daily Express. 
"Quite a few people knew his name ... 
Kosovo is a small country; secrets do not last long, especially when they concern the leaders of an armed struggle against the Serbs during the Kosovo war," Haxhiu said. 
He added that he never intended to intervene in the course of justice. 
Haradinaj recently won acquittal, though allegations of witness intimidation marred his trial.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic said on national television Tuesday (22 June) that "the Srebrenica tragedy represents a black page in the history of the Serb people." He was the first Republika Srpska head of state to acknowledge that atrocities were committed in Srebrenica in July 1995.
While acknowledging nothing could justify such actions, he stopped short of offering an outright apology.
In other news Tuesday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said authorities have implemented 91 per cent of the so-called Mrakovici action plan for reforms, agreed on last June between the central and entity governments.
The implementation of the last 11 measures should be completed by 1 August, he said.
Also Tuesday, the BiH presidency's Croat member, Dragan Covic, voiced pessimism about prospects for an invitation to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme at the Istanbul summit next week.
The problem, he said, is the lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

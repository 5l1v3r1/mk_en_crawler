PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic formally proposed that incumbent Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic serve a sixth term Thursday (May 7th). 
According to Vujanovic, Djukanovic is the best person to lead Montenegro through the economic crisis and guide it to its ultimate goal of EU membership. 
The coalition led by Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists won a landslide victory last month in early parliamentary elections. 
Parliament must still approve his appointment.

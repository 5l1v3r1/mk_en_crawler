WASHINGTON, United States -- Gen James Jones, the commander of the US forces in Europe, signaled that the Pentagon was contemplating changes in what he described as the US military's "footprint" in Europe.
He explained that some major bases will be retained but there would probably be a move to set up "bare-bone" facilities in Eastern Europe that would make it possible to move forces quickly to areas in Asia and the Middle East.
Bulgaria and Romania are considered among the most likely candidates to host such installations.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski intervened Tuesday (8 April) on behalf of two officials being investigated in connection with a huge political scandal involving alleged wire-tapping.
He effectively precluded the prosecution of former Interior Minister Dosta Dimovska and Aleksandar Cvetkov, a former senior official at the ministry.
They were accused of illegally wire-tapping phone conversations of 100 state officials, opposition leaders, journalists and other public personalities.
Trajkovski says the case is politically motivated and could threaten national security if pursued.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski said he was stunned by the decision.
In other news Tuesday, Justice Minister Ismail Dardhishta told the Albanian-language daily <I>Fakti</I> that detained former members of the National Liberation Army would be released in a week.
On Monday, ethnic Albanians staged a two-hour blockade of the Skopje-Tetovo highway demanding their release.

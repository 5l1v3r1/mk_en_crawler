SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Two ethnic Albanian members of parliament lost their immunity from prosecution Sunday (September 28th) amid suspicions they committed war crimes during the 2001 conflict in Macedonia.
Prosecutors announced they intend to charge Hisen Dzemaili and Hajrulu Misini, both members of the Democratic Union for Integration.
Authorities suspect Dzemaili was one of 23 culprits who kidnapped and tortured four construction workers in 2001.
Misini allegedly participated in a sabotage operation to cut off the water supply in Kumanovo.

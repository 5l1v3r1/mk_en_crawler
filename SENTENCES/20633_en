SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The six ruling coalition parties are meeting on Monday (March 10th) in the building that houses parliament, with police reform the likely topic.
Little is being said about the session.
Party of Democratic Action (SDA) secretary general Amir Zukic said on Friday only that it is being organised by SDA leader Sulejman Tihic.
At the end of January, the SDA said it was withdrawing support for the long-awaited police reform package, a key condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
Last month, the laws were passed in both chambers of the state-level parliament without the SDA's support.
Pressure may be growing however;
just last week, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the Union would be ready to seal the SAA in April, provided BiH adopts police-reform laws by then.

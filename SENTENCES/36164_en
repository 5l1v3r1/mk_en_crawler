BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic said Thursday (11 March) that he would announce the date for the presidential election on 4 April.
That means the actual vote must be held on 28 June at the latest.
Candidates already are lining up, including the deputy head of the Serbian Radical Party, Tomislav Nikolic.
He won the last effort, though the results were nullified due to low voter turnout.
With the 50 per cent requirement gone, the chances of electing a president are much higher.
Socialist Party of Serbia whip Ivica Dacic says his party would likely nominate a candidate of its own, as would some former DOS members.
Also Thursday, Markovic announced that Serbia's new constitution would likely be adopted by 28 June, to coincide with the election.
Drafting the document has taken months, due to political turmoil and profound differences.

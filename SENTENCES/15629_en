PODGORICA, Montenegro -- One of Montenegro's most prominent writers was beaten up by several unidentified individuals, who also killed his driver-bodyguard.
Jevrem Brkovic, 73, said several masked men carrying guns and clubs attacked him in front of his apartment.
He told reporters that the attack late Tuesday (October 24th) was the local mafia's retaliation for his latest novel, "A Duklja Lover".
Among other things, the book explores links between politicians and the criminal underworld.
This was not the first apparent mafia hit in Montenegro.
In 2004, the editor of the country's main opposition newspaper was shot dead for reporting links between officials and organised crime.
His killers were never caught.

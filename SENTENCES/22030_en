ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Peasants' Party (HSS) will not team up with the Social Democrat Party (SDP), the country's largest opposition formation, for local elections next spring.
Nenad Matic, chief secretary of HSS, ruled it out in an interview Saturday (May 17th) with the daily newspaper Vjesnik.
In the 2005 local elections, HSS allied with SDP, and suffered its worst defeat ever.
HSS is now a member of the ruling coalition, led by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).
But Matic didn't say this means HSS would automatically seek an alliance with HDZ.
He said that local party organisations would be allowed to pick allies, without any interference from the party leadership.

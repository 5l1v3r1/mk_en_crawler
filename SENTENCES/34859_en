SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Friday (1 August), High Representative Paddy Ashdown criticised the failure of an inter-party commission to reach an agreement on the status of Mostar.
He said the failure sent a negative signal about BiH to Europe.
"For the first time Mostar's elected representatives had an opportunity to forge a modern European administrative system for their citizens," said Ashdown, expressing his regret about the commission's failure to meet the 31 July deadline.
The final session failed due to lack of quorum, as representatives of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action boycotted the panel.
The deadline will now be extended until the end of the year.

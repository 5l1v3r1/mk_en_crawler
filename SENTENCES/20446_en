ATHENS, Greece -- George Papandreou was re-elected leader of the leftist PASOK on Sunday (November 11th) despite the party's bitter defeat in September's parliamentary elections. 
With 25% of the votes counted, he secured an unbeatable lead of 60%. 
The other main contender, Evangelos Venizelos, was second with 33%, and Costas Skandalidis, the third candidate, received 6%. 
Voting was extended by two hours Sunday because of computer problems and the arrival of last-minute voters who had to be registered before casting their ballots.

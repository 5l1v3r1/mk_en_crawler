BUCHAREST, Romania -- Storms pounded eastern Romania at the weekend, damaging houses, roads and infrastructure in the counties of Buzau, Prahova and Dambovita. 
According to local press reports Monday (15 August), about 150 families in these regions are isolated by flooding that cut communication links. 
The floods also caused the collapse of two bridges -- a railway bridge in Giurgiu and a pedestrian one in Maracineni.
It was also announced that the Development Bank of the Council of Europe has extended an 8.8m-euro loan to Romania. 
The funds will go towards rebuilding the water supply system in the western region of Banat, ravaged by floods in July.

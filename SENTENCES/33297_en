THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic asked the judges Thursday (8 May) for at least six more months to complete their case.
They argued that Milosevic's frequent absences and his refusal to appoint defence counsel have resulted in significant delays.
As of now, the prosecution has a matter of weeks to complete its phase of the trial.
In other news Thursday, a court in Belgrade ruled that two former senior security officers can be extradited to stand trial in The Hague.
Milosevic-era officials Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic were indicted last week for their role in running paramilitary units in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia from 1991 to 1995.

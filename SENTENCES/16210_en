ZAGREB, Croatia -- Interior Minister Ivica Kirin and the Osijek-Baranja County Police Department both denied on Tuesday (16 May) media allegations that police advised Serbian journalists not to go to Osijek for security reasons.
The statements came a day after Zagreb media reported that a Serbian delegation, consisting of representatives of the Belgrade prosecution's special war crimes unit and reporters, scrapped a planned trip to Osijek after Croatian border police advised them of safety concerns.
The Osijek-Baranja County Police Department said that the main reason the Serb representatives did not visit Osijek was a delay in their schedule.

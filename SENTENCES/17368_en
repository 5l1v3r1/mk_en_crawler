BELGRADE, Serbia -- Oliver Dulic of the Democratic Party (DS) was elected as Parliament speaker on Wednesday (May 23rd) by a vote of 135 to 98, with two abstentions. 
Dulic, 32, was the sole candidate for the post, left vacant by Serbian Radical Party (SRS) Tomislav Nikolic's quick resignation amid strong domestic and international pressure on May 13th. 
Parliament also elected three deputy Parliament speakers Wednesday from the ranks of SRS, G17 Plus and the ethnic minorities' parties.

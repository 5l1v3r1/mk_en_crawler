NEW YORK, United States -- The UN General Assembly elected on Thursday (October 15th) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as a non-permanent member of the Security Council alongside Brazil, Nigeria, Gabon and Lebanon. 
Their two-year term begins on January 1st. 
They will replace Vietnam, Libya, Burkina Faso, Croatia and Costa Rica. 
BiH will take a seat on the council for the first time. 
Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj, noting BiH's recent war experience, vowed the country will be "a strong voice for preventive diplomacy".
In other news Thursday, BiH authorities started issuing biometric passports. 
Their introduction is a precondition set by the EU for eventual visa-free travel by Bosnian citizens.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The financial police of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) said Friday (21 March) that they are awaiting an official government request to launch an investigation into the FBiH Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons.
Last week, the Office of the High Representative presented the findings of an audit which suggested over 7m euros had been embezzled.
Former Deputy Minister Mijat Tuka -- blamed for the affair together with three of his close associates -- insisted Friday that it did not happen during his watch.
He says he will not give up his position as a member of the FBiH Parliament, despite a demand by the international community's High Representative, Paddy Ashdown.
In other news Friday, US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond said the war in Iraq poses no threat to BiH's security and stability.
He added that events in Iraq would be unlikely to alter the US commitment to provide assistance to BiH and the region.

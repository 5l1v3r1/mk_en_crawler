STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament voted Wednesday (13 April) to approve the EU accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007. 
The move opens the way for the signing of accession treaties with both countries later this month. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said he was optimistic about the ability of the two countries to meet the criteria for membership. 
But he noted that the EU would not hesitate to invoke a protective clause that provides for a 12 month delay of the accessions if either country fails to meet the relevant standards.
During a visit to Bucharest on Tuesday, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen reaffirmed his country's readiness to provide technical assistance to Romania in its EU bid. 
He and Romanian counterpart Calin Popescu Tariceanu also agreed on the need to boost bilateral economic co-operation.

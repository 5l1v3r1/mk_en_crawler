ANKARA, Turkey -- The chief of the General Staff, General Ilker Basbug, on Monday (September 21st) urged members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to lay down their weapons and help efforts to extend the rights of Turkey's Kurdish minority.
"We cannot reach a solution with guns and blood," Basbug said.
Meanwhile, for the first time, a state theatre plans to stage a play which includes segments in the previously forbidden Kurdish language.
The initiative is part of a government effort to improve the rights of minorities and implement criteria necessary for Turkey's EU accession.
The play, called "Living Death", is about murders committed to protect the honour of women.
It will be performed on October 1st in Diyarbakir, the biggest city in the Kurd-dominated southeast.

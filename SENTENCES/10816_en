SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg expressed frustration Thursday (4 November) with persistent rumours of widespread corruption in Bulgaria.
In an interview for the Dutch press, Saxe-Coburg said that most corruption claims are exaggerated and that there has been considerable improvement in the transparency of state administration.
As proof, he cited the latest survey by Transparency International, which confirmed reduced levels of corruption.
Also Thursday, the government approved the allocation of 38m euros from the 2005 budget for financing peacekeeping missions abroad.
The cabinet also agreed to disburse an additional 12m euros to complete structural reforms related to Bulgaria's commitments as a NATO ally.
These include upgrading equipment and supplies.

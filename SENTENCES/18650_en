PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Saturday (February 10th), US troops backed by EU peacekeepers raided the home of Radomir Kojic, a Bosnian Serb suspected of helping Radovan Karadzic evade justice.
A spokesman for the Alliance, Derek Chappel, said the operation had been carried out to find more about Karadzic's possible whereabouts.
Bosnian Serb police provided some support, and the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) took part.
Investigators from the International War Crimes Tribunal (ICTY) were also present.
In other news, BiH's Nezavisne Novine daily quoted US Ambassador to Bosnia Douglas McElhaney saying that Washington does not want the UN tribunal to close before Karadzic and his wartime commander Ratko Mladic are arrested and tried.
He added that the United States will keep up the pressure on local authorities in countries where the two men may be hiding.

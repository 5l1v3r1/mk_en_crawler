BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu remained the most trusted politician in the country in September, according to the latest poll by the INSOMAR agency. 
Results released on Sunday (October 22nd) suggest Basescu maintained his lead with 60% of voter confidence, followed by his former adviser, Theodor Stolojan. 
The latter was recently expelled from the National Liberal Party (PNL) for criticising the current party chairmanship. 
Third in the poll was independent deputy Mona Musca, who was also recently expelled from the PNL amid evidence of collaboration with the former security services Securitate.
In other news, Basescu left on Sunday for a three-day official visit to India. 
He told Indian counterpart APJ Abdul Kalam that Bucharest views India as a foreign policy priority.

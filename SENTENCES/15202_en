ANKARA, Turkey -- The size of the country's land forces will be reduced in line with the army modernisation plan, new Turkish Chief of Staff Yasar Buyukanit said on Friday (25 August). 
Buyukanit's comment came during a ceremony to mark the transfer of Land Forces command to General Ilker Basbug. 
Buyukanit said the forces will be cut by up to 30 per cent, but the exact scope is yet to be determined. 
He ruled out any notion of shortening the length of compulsory conscript service.

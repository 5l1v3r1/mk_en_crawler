ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said on Wednesday (April 11th) that he had abandoned plans to meet with the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to discuss the upcoming presidential elections.
Erdogan says that since CHP is threatening to boycott the election and openly questions the legality of Parliament choosing the president, a meeting would be a waste of time.
Analysts expect Erdogan to run for the office, thought he has not officially declared his candidacy.
On Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc suggested holding the first round of elections on either April 26th or May 3rd.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Jalal Talabani, the head of the Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and Nechirvan Barzani, a senior member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, arrived in Turkey Sunday (16 March) for talks with Turkish and US officials on the situation in Iraq. 
A representative of Iraq's Turkmen minority will also attend negotiations, expected Tuesday and Wednesday. 
President Bush sent his special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, to the talks. 
The Iraqi minority leaders are expected to try to persuade the Turkish government not to send troops into northern Iraq if there is a military conflict. 
The <I>Milliyet</I> newspaper reported on Sunday that President Bush has written to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to warn him against unilateral Turkish action in northern Iraq. 
<I> Milliyet</I> also reported Sunday that the EU has offered Turkey $2 billion if it continues to refuse US troops permission to deploy on its soil. 
The newspaper says Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis made the offer during a phone call to Erdogan, congratulating him on becoming prime minister.

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) Ambassador to Tirana, Lutz Salzmann, is urging squabbling political parties to resume dialogue and ensure the continuation of reforms.
Speaking on the local TV channel Vision+ earlier this week, Salzmann warned that ongoing disputes between the ruling and opposition parties, which have blocked work in parliament for several weeks, are holding the country hostage and wasting precious time needed to implement reforms.
Attention and efforts must be focused on meeting the conditions for EU integration, he said.

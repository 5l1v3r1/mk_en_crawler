JERUSALEM, Israel -- Israel said on Monday (August 9th) it may withdraw from a UN inquiry into the deadly May 31st raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza, if Israeli soldiers are called to testify. 
The statement came only hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu testified before Israel's own commission investigating the case. 
He accused Turkey of having an interest in the violent confrontation and of refusing to exert influence to stop the flotilla. 
Turkey rejected those accusations as "ridiculous". 
Answering a reporter's question Monday in New York, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that there is no agreement against summoning Israeli soldiers to testify. 
In response, Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that "Israel will not co-operate with and will not take part in any panel that seeks to interrogate Israeli soldiers." Only a week ago Israel announced it will co-operate with the UN-led probe into the raid that killed nine Turkish activists.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU members approved the closing of two negotiation chapters with Croatia on Thursday (December 17th).
This clears the way for formal closure at an intergovernmental accession conference in Brussels on Monday, bringing the number closed to 17 out of 33.
Croatia has opened 28 chapters so far.
The country hopes to wrap up membership negotiations in the first half of 2010.
Also Thursday, the Croatian government forwarded for parliamentary approval two laws that aim to harmonise domestic legislation with that of the EU's.
A third is expected by the end of the year.

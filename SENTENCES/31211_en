ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin on Wednesday (March 2nd) rejected a request by the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) to replace the current prison sentence of jailed Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan with a house arrest measure. 
"This is impossible under the current laws," Ergin explained. 
Ocalan is serving a life sentence on an island near Istanbul. 
The BDP says the current situation threatens his mental health.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci announced on Monday (July 6th) that the government has allocated 300,000 euros for reconstruction of houses belonging to all communities in Mitrovica. 
He described the return of citizens to their property as a legitimate right of everyone and said rebuilding homes has created a new climate of interethnic communication and integration in the divided town.
In other news Monday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was in Geneva presenting a report on implementation of the Millennium Development Goals across the world. 
He noted progress has been slow regarding most goals set for 2015, including those set by Kosovo's parliament.

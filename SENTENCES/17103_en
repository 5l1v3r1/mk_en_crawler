SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Visiting Sarajevo on Tuesday (1 August), US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Clint Williamson urged increased regional co-operation to resolve the cases of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, as well as the development of domestic capacities to process war crimes cases.
Meeting with Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic, Williamson stressed that Washington would like to see remaining cases in the region closed as soon as possible.
Tihic, in turn, said that the capture and extradition of remaining suspects to the UN tribunal in The Hague is a prerequisite for lasting peace, reconciliation and trust building.

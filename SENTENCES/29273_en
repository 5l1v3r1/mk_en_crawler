ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul ordered on Sunday the re-arrest of 19 active and retired military officers charged with planning to topple the government.
The group that was originally arrested in February was released from detention on Thursday pending trial, local media reported.
They are charged in relation to a plot dubbed "Sledgehammer" which allegedly aimed to destabilise the country through attacks at mosques and museums that would lead to chaos and ultimately bring down the government.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) hammered out the strategy Tuesday (April 8th) it will follow in the months ahead to stave off an attempt to close it down.
Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya has gone to court to ban the AKP for allegedly undermining Turkey's secular character.
In response, the AKP is launching a broad democratisation package, followed by a constitutional amendment to prevent any closure ruling by the Constitutional Court.
The AKP also plans to seek support from opposition parties.
EU officials continue to criticise the closure case against the AKP -- foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday that the move posed a grave risk to Turkey's EU bid.

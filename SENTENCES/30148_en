WASHINGTON, United States -- Kosovo Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj says dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia is in the interest of both countries and their citizens. 
Speaking at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington on Tuesday (May 17th), Hoxhaj rejected the notion of partition, saying that the Ahtisaari plan closed the chapter on Kosovo's statehood. 
"Kosovo is a functional, multi-ethnic and democratic state and partition is against state interest, with big consequences on the region." Acknowledging that last week's visit to Pristina by the head of Serbia's negotiation team Borko Stefanovic caused a stir, Hoxhaj said that the delegation paid a visit to an independent Kosovo, and that soon, officials from Pristina will officially visit Belgrade.

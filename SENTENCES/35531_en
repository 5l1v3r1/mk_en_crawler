PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO will reduce the number of its troops in Pristina and central Kosovo, a KFOR commander said Monday (9 February).
About 2,000 troops currently serving in the Swedish-led Multinational Brigade Centre will be replaced with a smaller unit of soldiers from Finland, Sweden, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Latvia.
The new unit will be deployed on 1 May and will focus on intelligence-based operations.
In other news, the trial of Shefqet Musliu, a senior figure in the now-disbanded Albanian Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, is due to start Tuesday.
The former guerrilla leader is charged with various crimes, including kidnapping and attempted extortion.
A panel of international judges will try him.
Meanwhile, the government of Kosovo announced Monday that it will be ready to start talks with Belgrade by mid-February.
Refugees, missing persons, energy and transport will be the chief topics.

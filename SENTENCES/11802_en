BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Dragoljub Ojdanic, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and ex-Serbian Army General Vladimir Lazarevic arrived in Belgrade on Friday (15 April) evening after being released from The Hague on bail. 
The four will stay in Belgrade until their trials begins at The Hague tribunal.
Also Friday, former Republika Srpska (RS) military police sub-commander in Foca, Gojko Jankovic, pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of war crimes during his appearance before The Hague tribunal. 
He surrendered last month, ending nearly nine years on the run.
Separately, former RS Army General Radivoje Miletic pleaded not guilty Friday to war crimes charges stemming from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
His appearance before The Hague tribunal followed two postponements of his plea last month.

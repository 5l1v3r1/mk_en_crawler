BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Thursday (March 27th) that he plans to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to rule on the validity of Kosovo's recent unilateral declaration of independence. 
He said Serbia will attempt to get UN permission to file such a request at the world court, probably in September.
Speaking in Indonesia, where he continues his bid to prevent the recognition of Kosovo, Jeremic said he was a "cautious optimist" about Serbia's chances of winning support among UN member states.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu has asked parliament to hold a new vote of confidence regarding the coalition cabinet, according to an announcement Wednesday (20 July). 
Tariceanu recently reversed an earlier decision to resign, citing devastating floods over the past several weeks. 
He said recovery efforts leave no time to organise early elections.

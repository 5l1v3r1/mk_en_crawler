ZAGREB, Croatia -- In a press interview Saturday (21 December), Prime Minister Ivica Racan described the economic and political situation in Croatia as stable and improving.
He said recent macroeconomic indicators are exceptionally good, and stressed that the unemployment rate has edged lower for nine consecutive months.
He also cited a business survey showing improved expectations and outlined government plans to raise wages in the public sector next year.
However, Racan expressed concerns that the anti-corruption programme was not producing enough results.
In other news, the interior ministry reported Sunday that police have confiscated 43,000 pirated CDs and computer equipment worth more than $2m.
Some 50 people were questioned in the course of a nationwide police operation last week.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is asking High Representative to BiH Valentin Inzko to help him obtain documents necessary for his defence before The Hague war crimes tribunal, local media reported on Tuesday (July 21st).
In a letter to Inzko, Karadzic noted he sent a request for these documents on June 2nd but received no response.
He stressed that BiH authorities can contribute to the fairness of the trial against him.
Karadzic is accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
In other news Tuesday, forensic experts began searching for the remains of about 200 Bosniak and Croat civilians killed by Bosnian Serb forces in August 1992.
A group of war prisoners from the Prijedor area were supposed to be transferred to Travnik, but instead were driven away by bus, lined up at the edge of a ravine and killed.
Excavations at Mount Vlasic in central BiH will take several days.

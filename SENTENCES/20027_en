PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Serbia will not be allowed to send army troops and police back to Kosovo, a spokesman for NATO-led KFOR said on Saturday (August 18th). 
Colonel Michael Knop said security in the province was the responsibility of KFOR, and that NATO had no plans to authorise any such move. 
Aleksandar Simic, a senior adviser to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, said in an interview published earlier Saturday that the time had come for Belgrade to send security forces to protect Serbs in Kosovo. 
He cited UN Security Council resolution 1244, which contains an option for up to 1,000 Serbian security personnel to protect certain sites in the province.
On Thursday, the Serbian National Council of Northern Kosovo urged the government in Belgrade to send troops to guard Serb-populated areas. 
Ulpiana Lama, a spokesperson for the Kosovo government, said Simic's request was "absurd".

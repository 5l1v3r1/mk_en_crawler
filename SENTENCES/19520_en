PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police arrested Pristina International Airport director Afrim Haziri and the airport's procurement office head Vlora Ferizi on Tuesday (March 25th) on charges of mismanagement and corruption. 
A third suspect, Petrol Company manager Shkelzen Jusaj, was detained later in the day. 
An investigation into possible corruption and misappropriation began seven months ago.
Haziri is not the first in his post to run afoul of the law. 
His immediate predecessor, Ioan Woolett, was arrested in December 2006 for taking bribes from job-seekers.

TIRANA, Albania -- One person died and three were injured after an explosion at the Pigas ammunition dismantling depot in Skrapar, southern Albania on Thursday (April 28th).
The injured are being treated at the military hospital in Tirana.
The defence ministry has ordered dismantling efforts all over the country halted following the incident, as investigators determine the circumstances.
Only a day earlier, there was a similar incident at a depot in Polican, where a 34-year-old worker was injured.
Dismantling old ammunition proved tragic three years ago at the Gerdec depot outside Tirana.
An explosion killed 26, injured scores more and caused massive property damage.

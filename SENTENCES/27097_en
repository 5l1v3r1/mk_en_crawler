ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou accepted an invitation to meet with Macedonian counterpart Nikola Gruevski, Greek government spokesperson George Petalotis announced Thursday (February 4th). 
The date will be determined via diplomatic channels and require significant preparation. 
Gruevski phoned Papandreou on Wednesday to follow up on a written invitation sent the day before. 
Papandreou said he would meet Gruevski in Macedonia or any mutually acceptable location. 
Macedonia and Greece has been locked in a longstanding name dispute that has slowed Macedonia's EU bid.

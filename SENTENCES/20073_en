ZAGREB, Croatia -- The defence ministry denied on Monday (March 17th) a media report suggesting NATO plans to establish a base on the Peljesac peninsula in the Dalmatia region. 
There will be no such bases in Dalmatia or elsewhere, the ministry said in a statement, responding to a report in the daily Slobodan Dalmacia. 
Croatia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace programme in 2000 and hopes to receive an invitation to full Alliance membership early next month.

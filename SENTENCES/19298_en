BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers met on Monday (January 28th) in Brussels to decide whether to proceed with the signing of Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia. 
The accord was initialled on November 7th 2007, but the final endorsement depends on Serbia's level of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
Recently, new chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said Belgrade authorities are failing to achieve the main benchmark: the arrest of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, who is believed to be hiding in Serbia.
Ahead of Monday's meeting, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Serbia is close to achieving full co-operation. 
"This will facilitate the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement shortly," Rehn told reporters, insisting that the EU should send a very strong signal of a European future to the Serbian people.
In a statement Sunday, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated that Serbia should not sign the SAA if the EU decides to send a mission to Kosovo. 
He warned that deploying an EU mission without the consent of the UN Security Council would amount to implementing the internationally supervised independence of Kosovo.

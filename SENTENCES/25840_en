ANKARA, Turkey -- The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) submitted a no-confidence motion against Interior Minister Besir Atalay on Wednesday (February 17th), saying he instructed judges and prosecutors to release alleged terrorists, the Cihan news agency reported. 
The motion claims a secret meeting was held on October 17th 2009 between Atalay and the head of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). 
Reportedly, the two sides agreed to release members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) who entered Turkey from northern Iraq two days later. 
The group returned to Turkey as part of a government initiative to expand the rights of the Kurdish minority. 
They were immediately detained for questioning upon entering Turkey, but most were later released. 
The government and the BDP deny the CHP's claims.

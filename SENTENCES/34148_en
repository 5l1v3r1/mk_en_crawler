SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A parliamentary committee approved on Tuesday (15 July) a bill liberalising foreign exchange operations in the country. 
The measure would also allow domestic banks to grant foreign currency credits. 
The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia would set conditions for disbursement. 
This would increase credit opportunities for local companies and create a basis for the reduction of interest rates. 
The law, if approved, would boost the independence of the central bank and bar those with dubious reputations from participating in bank ownership.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Several people were injured slightly by bomb blasts in Istanbul and two other cities on Monday (15 August). 
A time-controlled device went off in front of the government building in Beytussebap, in the southeast province of Sirnak, causing damage but no casualties. 
An explosion near an ATM in Mardin, near the Syrian border, injured four people who were lining up to withdraw money. 
In Istanbul, a small bomb exploded in front of an underground shopping area Sunday evening, slightly injuring one person. 
Authorities believe that the attacks were the work of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) terrorists.
In other news, authorities announced that police detained four suspected members of the PKK in the southeastern city of Batman late last week. 
Officials say they had explosives, which they allegedly planned to use against the city's downtown area.

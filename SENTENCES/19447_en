SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country has demonstrated it is serious about defence reform and its NATO aspirations, OHR Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said on Thursday (March 27th).
His remarks came after state and entity government representatives signed an agreement in Doboj on determining all rights and liabilities related to so-called movable defence property.
Among other things, the accord outlines procedures for the disposal of surplus weapons, ammunition and explosives and the distribution of the proceeds from any sales to the entities and the state.
Gregorian called the agreement "another milestone in defence reform implementation".
In a separate statement, however, the OHR criticised the new law on public servants' salaries which stipulates all salaries would be set by the Council of Ministers.
The OHR, the European Commission and the World Bank have all expressed concern that this could undermine the independence of the judiciary, the border police and other security agencies.

FERIZAJ/UROSEVAC, Kosovo, Serbia -- The OSCE mission chief in Kosovo, Ambassador Werner Wnendt, urged interim institutions and local self-governments on Monday (June 25th) to work harder in protecting all ethnic minority communities and fully integrating them into society. 
In Ferizaj/Urosevac, he presented a new OSCE report on the registration of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities in Kosovo. 
It found that between 20% and 40% of community members are not registered as residents. 
Wnendt stressed that registration is "a fundamental prerequisite for access to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights".

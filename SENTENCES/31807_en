BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinator on Kosovo Nebojsa Covic has rejected a call from Kosovo officials urging Belgrade to participate in the process of eventual independence.
On Saturday (4 January), Covic condemned a statement by Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi proposing that Belgrade should participate as an observer in talks on the status of the province.
"Serbia cannot be a neighbouring state to itself because Kosovo was made an inherent part of Serbia and Yugoslavia by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244," said Covic.

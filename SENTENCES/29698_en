ZAGREB, Croatia -- Independent lawmaker Ivica Pancic filed charges with the anticorruption office, USKOK, on Friday (January 28th) against the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party amid the legal woes of its former leader, ex-prime minister Ivo Sanader. 
He was arrested in Austria last month, following an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia, which is probing possible criminal actions and abuse of power. 
According to Pancic, the party maintained secret "cash boxes" and even bought Sanader a luxury car.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's richest man, Bogoljub Karic, on Sunday (20 June) backed Democratic Party presidential candidate Boris Tadic against ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic. 
Karic, running as an independent, caused a major upset when he came in third during the first round of the presidential election on 13 June, beating ruling coalition candidate Dragan Marsicanin. 
The run-off will be held Sunday. 
Tadic has also been endorsed by the two major ruling coalition parties: the Democratic Party of Serbia and G17 Plus.

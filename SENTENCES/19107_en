STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) approved on Thursday (November 30th) reports on Bulgaria and Romania's accession to the EU, drafted respectively by rapporteurs Geoffrey van Orden and Pierre Moscovici.
However, the EP members refused to support a proposed extension of the decommissioning deadline for the oldest units at Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear plant.
The external relations committee gave the green light to the extension last week.
As regards Romania, the MEPs rejected a proposal for the resumption of international adoptions.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan warned the United States on Sunday (March 8th) not to recognise what some describe as the World War I-era Armenian genocide by Turkey. 
This would only impede efforts to reconcile Turkey and Armenia, Babacan said in an interview with NTV. 
"It would not be rational for a third country to take a position on this topic," he said. 
He added, however, the new US administration "understands better Turkey's sensibilities" regarding the issue. 
Several times during his successful presidential campaign, Barack Obama said he intended to recognise the killing of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917 as genocide. 
Turkey argues the Armenians were victims of a civil war.
In other news, Turkey heard its first official sermon in Kurdish at a mosque in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir Saturday, media reported on Sunday. 
The sermon, marking the birthday of the prophet Mohammad, was part of the government's efforts to boost the Kurdish minority's rights in order to meet EU political standards.

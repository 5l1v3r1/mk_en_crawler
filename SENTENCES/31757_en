SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Senior local and international officials in Sarajevo reacted Wednesday (8 January) to comments Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic made earlier this week in the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I>. 
Djindjic implied that Belgrade might initiate a new Dayton-like conference unless Kosovo Albanians stop demanding independence for the province. 
In BiH, that was interpreted as an attempt to revise existing borders in the Balkans. 
In response, the BiH Foreign Ministry issued a press release describing such statements as harmful to neighbourly relations and regional co-operation. 
The Office of the High Representative in BiH also expressed concern over the statement. 
But Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi suggested Wednesday that the mere fact the issue of independence and borders is being raised is positive.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state-level parliament is due to debate and vote on key police reform measures Thursday (April 10th), an issue crucial to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
Three proposals are on the agenda, one submitted by each of the three ruling coalition parties -- the SBiH, the SNSD, and HDZ 1990.
Media reports suggest there is also a fourth draft prepared by the international community.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak refused to talk about it at a press conference Wednesday but expressed optimism that this time the crucial bills would be approved.
In a joint letter to lawmakers Thursday, 13 NGOs urged them to adopt the police laws and open BiH's path to eventual EU membership.

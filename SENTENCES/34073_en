ANKARA, Turkey -- The government submitted the 7th EU harmonisation package to parliament on Wednesday (23 July).
Under the proposed reforms, the National Security Council would become an advisory rather than a legislative body, and would meet once every two months rather than monthly.
The package also proposes that the secretary general of the council be a civilian appointed by the prime minister and approved by the president.
The changes are in line with EU demands for a reduced military role in politics.

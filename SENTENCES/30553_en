STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday (December 14th) that a 2003 decision by Turkey's Constitutional Court to shut down the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HADEP) violated the right of freedom of assembly and association.
The closure ruling was based on the view that HADEP was a "centre of illegal activities" supporting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.
But in its decision Tuesday, the European Court said that although strongly critical of the government's policy towards Kurds at times, HADEP's activities did not amount to inciting armed resistance or acts of violence.

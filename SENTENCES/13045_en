ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Thursday (29 December) that he would be ready to testify at The Hague against Generals Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak, all of whom have been indicted in connection with 1995 war crimes against Serbs. 
He also reiterated Croatia's commitment to help the war crimes tribunal and urged that every Croatian citizen asked to help UN investigators should readily co-operate.
Separately, Gotovina's lawyer, Marin Ivanovic, says testimony by members of the Croatian Defence Council and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Army (BiH) command -- as well as BiH war documents -- would be crucial to the defence, especially with regard to the 1995 Operation Storm. 
Gotovina was arrested in Spain earlier this month after four years on the run.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic met with the US Ambassador to Serbia Mary Warlick on Tuesday (February 9th), saying afterwards that political situation in the country is stable and that the Democratic Party-led coalition government plans to stay in power until its mandate ends.
A petition drive now under way calls for early elections.
Dacic also briefed Warlick on his recent trip to the United States and on plans for further co-operation between the two countries.
Also Tuesday, Dacic said his Serbian Socialist Party will support a resolution condemning crimes committed in Srebrenica in 1995, as well as one, if initiated, condemning all crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
The resolutions would require consensus in parliament.

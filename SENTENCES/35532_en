FRANKFURT, Germany -- US experts are to arrive in Bulgaria and Romania on Tuesday (10 February) to scout possible sites for the deployment of US military bases.
In recent statements, senior US officials, including Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell, indicated that Washington plans to establish small facilities for training and rapid deployment of troops.
These would replace some of the large bases built during the Cold War period.
In other news Tuesday, delegations from Bulgaria and Romania are holding talks with the European Commission in Brussels.
The subject is the financial package covering the first years of EU membership.
The Commission is expected to announce a framework totaling 9 billion to 10 billion euros for the two countries.

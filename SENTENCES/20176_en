SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's special war crimes court has indicted a former Bosnian Muslim soldier for crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Suad Kapic, nicknamed Hodza, is charged with the murder of four prisoners of war in the village of Debar, towards the end of the Bosnian conflict.
All of the victims were Bosnian Serb soldiers.
In other news, families of people killed in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre prevented 12 former Dutch soldiers from visiting the local memorial and cemetery on Thursday (October 18th).
The visitors were members of the Dutch battalion deployed to guard the UN-protected enclave of Srebrenica when it was over-run by Bosnian Serb troops.

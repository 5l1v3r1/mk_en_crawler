ZAGREB, Croatia -- Economic Chamber President Nadan Vidosevic announced on Wednesday (September 2nd) that he will run in the January presidential elections.
The latest polls suggest that he is among the candidates that can rely on significant support.
Vidosevic is a member of the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), but will run as an independent.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, who leads the HDZ, says Vidosevic will be expelled from the party for failing to support the party's decision to nominate Andrija Hebrang as its candidate.
The main opposition Social Democratic Party is nominating Ivo Josipovic.
President Stipe Mesic's second and final term expires in February 2010, necessitating the January election.

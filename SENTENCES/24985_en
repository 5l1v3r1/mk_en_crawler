PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Marking International Day of the Disappeared on Sunday (August 30th), associations representing families of missing persons noted that ten years after the 1998-1999 conflict, 1,887 people are still missing.
Activist Haki Kosumi said the number of relatives looking for their missing falls every day, due to disappointment and failed promises from all governments.
EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said the day provided a good opportunity to raise public awareness concerning this very important and sensitive issue.
"We conclude that reconciliation and the complete reconstruction of a society structure cannot be built until an answer has been given to the relatives of the missing persons," de Kermabon said in a press release.

WASHINGTON, United States -- A draft bill backing offers of NATO membership to Georgia, Albania, Croatia and Macedonia was submitted to the US Senate on Tuesday (February 6th).
The document was prepared by Republicans Richard Lugar and John McCain, along with Democrat Joseph Biden.
The draft resolution suggests that accepting the four countries in NATO would strengthen security and stability in Europe, and stipulates the exact amount of US financial assistance each would receive to help implement defence and political reforms.

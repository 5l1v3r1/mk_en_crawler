BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru announced on Friday (October 23rd) that he has sent his cabinet nominations and governing programme to parliament.
The proposed cabinet has 14 ministers instead of the current 16;
the ministries for Small and Medium Enterprises and for relations with parliament would be shut down.
Half of the appointees are Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) members from the outgoing cabinet.
Opposition parties quickly rejected the proposed nominations, saying the cabinet has no chance of receiving a vote of confidence from parliament.
Nevertheless, Croitoru insists he will be able to muster the necessary parliamentary support for next week's vote.

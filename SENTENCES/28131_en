BUCHAREST, Romania -- The two largest opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party, decided on Monday (June 21st) to postpone a new motion of no confidence against the government until the autumn.
There were initially plans to introduce the new motion immediately after the cabinet survived one on June 15th that was requested under an emergency procedure to pass its fiscal austerity plan.
Both party opposition leaderships, however, decided it is too soon to spur more parliamentary debate.
Furthermore, the fiscal austerity measures will have affected the general public more heavily in a few months, which could boost support for the opposition.
The cabinet survived the latest vote narrowly.

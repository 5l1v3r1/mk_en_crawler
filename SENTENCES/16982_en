THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's Trial Chamber decided to postpone the trial for contempt of court against Croatian journalist Josip Jovic from Monday (3 July) to 11 July, after Jovic failed to appear in court. 
An arrest warrant would be issued if he fails to appear next week. 
His attorney says Jovic is caring for his wife, who broke her leg. 
The former editor of the Croatian daily Slobodna Dalmacija, Jovic is charged with revealing the identity of a protected witness in 2000.

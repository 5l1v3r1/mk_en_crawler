BUCHAREST, Romania -- After surviving a no-confidence vote last week, the cabinet is now facing another challenge -- a possible reshuffle.
Leaders of ruling coalition partner Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) decided late on Sunday (September 27th) to empower Prime Minister Emil Boc to take all actions to assure better governance.
Sources within the PDL say this implies a reshuffle of some ministers from the other coalition partner -- the Social Democratic Party (PSD).
The official announcement came from one of the PDL's senior members, Gheorghe Flutur.
Another important member of the PDL, Vasile Blaga, told Realitatea TV that Boc may replace some ministers.
On Monday, Boc sacked Interior Minister Dan Nica of the PSD, due to comments Nica made regarding the upcoming presidential elections.
Boc said Nica alleged that there could be fraud in November's ballot.
Nica's ministry organizes and oversees the poll.
The prime minister also cited the lack of progress in the fight against crime.
Boc asked the PSD to come up with a new nomination within 24 hours.
Nica was appointed interior minister and deputy prime minister in February, being the third PSD representative to have led the interior ministry as member of the PDL-PSD government.
The move has fueled already tense relations between the country's governing coalition parties.

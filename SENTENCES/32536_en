SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Luka Karadzic, the brother of Radovan Karadzic, told a Belgrade newspaper on Sunday (9 March) that the UN tribunal's most wanted suspect is not hiding in Serbia-Montenegro. 
Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte has said Karadzic often hid in a Montenegrin monastery.
The Serbia-Montenegro Army issued a statement of its own Sunday, rejecting accusations from The Hague that it is protecting Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. 
Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic was quoted Saturday as saying that Mladic disappeared more than a year ago when his followers lost the support of certain security structures in the country. 
But the international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, now maintains that Mladic is hiding in a Belgrade suburb, not in Republika Srpska. 
In his first speech Friday, new Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic pledged to co-operate more fully with The Hague tribunal.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The rightist opposition VMRO-Narodna (People's Party) demanded on Sunday (27 November) the resignation of army chief General Miroslav Stojanovski, amid doubts cast over his wartime past. 
The request came several days after regional media reports suggested that Croatian prosecutors plan to investigate Stojanovski's alleged involvement in war crimes committed in Vukovar in 1991. 
VMRO-Narodna General Secretary Jovan Andonovski said that the issue could jeopardise the stability of Macedonia's security system and urged Stojanovski to step down.
In other news, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski was due to meet on Monday with Public Prosecutor Aleksandar Prcevski and the chairman of the State Anti-Corruption Commission, Dragan Malinovski. 
The talks will focus on co-operation between the prosecution and the commission, which have virtually ignored each other for months.

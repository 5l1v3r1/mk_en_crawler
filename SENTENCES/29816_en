TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Monday (December 27th) rejected allegations published by the Serbian newspaper Politika, describing them as "racist slander which are part of the anti-Albanian hysteria orchestrated by Dick Marty".
In its article, Politika described Berisha as one of the main weapons dealers of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during the 1998-1999 war.
According to the newspaper, Belgrade prosecutors have testimony from four Kosovo Albanians who say they purchased weapons in Berisha's house in the northern village of Prifc.
"Politika is the mouthpiece of Serb ultra-nationalist circles and a blind advocate of the genocide committed by the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo," Berisha said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Ten members of a group of Kurds who returned to Turkey in October were arrested on Thursday (June 17th), as their trial opened.
They are part of a group of 34 people, including eight members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), who came to Turkey from the Makhmour refugee camp in northern Iraq in what they described as a test of the government's pledge to adopt a more democratic approach towards the Kurdish minority.
All of them, except for four minors, are facing trial at two separate courts in Diyarbakir.
Thursday's hearing included 16 members of the group, charged in connection with festivities organised to welcome them back to Turkey.
The eight PKK members are charged with belonging to a terror organisation and generating terrorist propaganda.

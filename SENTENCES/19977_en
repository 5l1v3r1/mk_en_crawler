THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals committee of the UN war crimes tribunal rejected on Thursday (January 17th) an appeal filed by lawyers representing retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina regarding his provisional release.
The committee upheld an earlier court decision, agreeing that the seriousness of the crimes he allegedly committed do not warrant release.
Gotovina, together with two other Croatian generals, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak, is being tried for war crimes during 1995's Operation Storm in which more than 150 Serb civilians were killed.

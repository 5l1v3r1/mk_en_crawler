ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Tuesday (7 October) voted 358-183 to allow the government to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq. 
The lawmakers left it to the executive branch to decide when and how many soldiers would be deployed. 
Senior Turkish officials worked to allay fears voiced by some members of Iraq's governing council, saying that Ankara's interest was solely in the stabilisation of its neighbour. 
The White House and US State Department welcomed parliament's decision. 
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he was confident that Turkey's participation would bolster security in Iraq.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- One of the late Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic's most trusted financial advisors, Borka Vucic, 83, died in a car accident on Saturday (August 1st) on Serbia's main highway connecting Belgrade with southern Serbia. 
Vucic was suspected of embezzling state-controlled banking funds transferred to offshore accounts in the 1990s. 
However, she was never charged. 
In 2008, Vucic was elected a member of parliament from the Socialist Party of Serbia.

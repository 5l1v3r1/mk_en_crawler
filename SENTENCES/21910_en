LUXEMBOURG -- Croatia opened two new negotiating chapters in its EU accession process Tuesday (June 17th), following a decision by EU foreign ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg. 
The new chapters -- on social policy and employment and on workers' freedom of movement -- make a total of 20 chapters opened so far. 
Croatia has managed to close two but hopes to boost the pace from now on -- authorities say that the goal of opening all 35 chapters by the end of the year remains realistic. 
The European Commission is expected to publish a road map for Croatia's EU membership next month.
Also Tuesday, EU foreign ministers decided to open two new chapters in Turkey's EU accession talks, the chapters on corporate law and intellectual property law. 
That makes a total of eight opened since accession talks began in 2005.

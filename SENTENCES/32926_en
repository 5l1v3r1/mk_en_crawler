SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Representatives of Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia asked the international community Wednesday (28 May) to assist them in a project that would provide a link between the Black Sea and the Adriatic.
The three countries want to build a railroad and a highway to connect Bulgaria's ports of Varna and Burgas with Albania's ports of Durres and Vlore.
The project to complete the railroad link between Bulgaria and Macedonia has been stalled for decades, initially for political reasons and then due to a lack of funds.

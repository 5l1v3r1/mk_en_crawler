ROME, Italy -- The Vatican announced Wednesday (21 May) that it is setting the stage for an elaborate ceremony at which it will give a church in Rome to Bulgarian Orthodox Christians. 
Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg will attend Saturday's ceremony, together with Vatican officials and diplomats. 
The event will take place as Bulgaria commemorates the Day of the Slavonic Alphabet. 
Pope John Paul II announced during his visit to Bulgaria last year that he has offered to give Orthodox Christians the right to use a church near the Trevi Fountain.

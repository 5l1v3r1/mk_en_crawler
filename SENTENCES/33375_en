PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Filip Vujanovic, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, says he plans to hold an independence referendum in three years, as stipulated in the agreement that served as the basis for forming the new loose union between Serbia and Montenegro. 
Expressing confidence he would win Sunday's (11 May) elections, Vujanovic said he would organise the referendum to allow Montenegrins to express their position.

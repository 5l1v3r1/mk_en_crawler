VIENNA, Austria -- Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, told visiting Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku on Tuesday (21 March) that he has a specific responsibility to reach out to Kosovo Serbs. 
She stressed that the ethnic Albanian majority must manifest "even greater commitment" to improving minority rights during the next round of status negotiations, scheduled for 3 April in Vienna.
On Wednesday, Ceku visited Brussels for meetings with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.

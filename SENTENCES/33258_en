ATHENS, Greece -- The government has nearly finalised talks with Albania on an agreement that would allow Albania's ethnic Greeks to hold dual nationality, cabinet spokesman Christos Protopappas said Tuesday (10 June). 
The document would allow Albanian nationals of Greek descent that have lived for several years in Greece to receive Greek citizenship, without losing Albanian citizenship. 
The interior ministers of the two countries are to complete the negotiations.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish humanitarian organisation Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) announced on Monday (October 4th) that about 500 activists from a dozen countries plan to join a new aid convoy to Gaza, in an effort to break the Israeli blockade there.
The IHH sponsored a flotilla that was raided by Israeli commandos on its way to Gaza in late May, leaving nine Turkish activists dead.
The new convoy will set off from India by land on December 2nd -- crossing Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Syria -- in hopes of reaching Gaza by sea by December 27th.
The IHH will organise the Turkish leg of the trip.

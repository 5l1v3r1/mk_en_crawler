TIRANA, Albania -- Edi Rama, leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), warns that party members and supporters will resume protests demanding transparency in relation to the June 2009 general elections.
At a party gathering in Korca on Sunday (June 6th), Rama briefed members on political developments and insisted the SP is determined to pursue the cause.
He says the government is ruining the economy and the economic crisis stems from a lack of governing transparency.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha rebutted the claims, saying his cabinet is working to reassure the SP that it has the determination to resolve the ten-month long political crisis.

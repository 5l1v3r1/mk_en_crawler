BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government on Thursday (3 February) approved a resolution allowing the reshuffle of the justice ministry.
The document stipulates that two of the main tasks of the ministry are to draft strategies for curbing crime and corruption and to draft bills that harmonise laws and court practices with international law, in light of Euro-Atlantic integration.
The reorganisation was needed to ensure the normal functioning of the institution after staff downsizing.

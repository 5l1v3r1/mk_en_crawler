SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Bulgaria and Macedonia are in a diplomatic row over a jail sentence handed down by a Macedonian court against a Bulgarian citizen. 
Spaska Mitrova, 23, was sentenced to three months in jail for refusing her Macedonian husband the right to visit their child. 
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry sent a note to Skopje on Wednesday (August 5th) asking for a review of the sentence, arguing it fails to meet EU criteria. 
The ministry threatened to block Macedonia's EU integration efforts over the case and accused Skopje of sentencing Mitrova to scare Macedonian nationals from seeking Bulgarian passports. 
Macedonia denies the accusations.

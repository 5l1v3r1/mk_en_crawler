ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The second hearing in the trial for the murder of prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was held in Istanbul on Monday (October 1st).
The main defendant, 17-year-old Ogun Samast, said he was under the influence of drugs when he gunned Dink down in January.
At the hearing, held behind closed doors because Samast is a minor, the defendant said that another suspect had given him ecstasy pills to embolden him.
Fellow defendant Yasin Hayal is charged with inciting the crime.
Dink's murder sent a shock through Turkey, with thousands turning out to pay their respects at his funeral.
On Monday, a crowd of hundreds gathered outside the courthouse, shouting "we are all witnesses, we demand justice".

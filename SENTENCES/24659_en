NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Special Representative in Cyprus Taye Brook Zerihoun said on Friday (April 3rd) that concrete efforts should be made to establish a mine-free buffer zone by 2011.
"Recent incidents have served as tragic reminders of the dangers these devices still represent," Zerihoun said, referring to blasts involving mine clearing experts and civilians last year.
Marking the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action, he urged the international community to renew its commitment to free the world of landmines and other explosives left from wars.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Federation Defence Minister Miroslav Nikolic presented details of ongoing military reforms Monday (29 September), stressing the savings that would result.
Under the reforms, the number of professional soldiers will be cut from 19,000 to 12,000.
Some of the savings would finance programmes to find alternative employment for dismissed military personnel.
The legislative changes would increase civilian control of the army in accordance with NATO and EU recommendations.

MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said on Wednesday (June 13th) that Russia was excluded from Tuesday's meeting of the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo, held in Paris. 
He described it as unacceptable and said "private discussions ... 
lead one to think that unilateral scenarios for Kosovo's independence are being prepared". 
The five other members of the Contact Group -- Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States -- issued a statement last Tuesday reaffirming their support for a UN resolution that would implement UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence of the province.
Separately Wednesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reiterated that his country would reject any unilateral recognition of Kosovo's independence. 
He made the comment in Stockholm, where he was participating in a Council of Europe forum on democracy. 
In Belgrade, meanwhile, Ministry for Kosovo State Secretary Dusan Prorokovic said Serbia would reconsider relations with countries that unilaterally recognise Kosovo's independence.

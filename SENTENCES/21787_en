PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Monday (August 18th) that Kosovo has not seen a single failure during its first six months of independence. 
As for what he views as the greatest successes of his government, Thaci cited the declaration of the former Serbian province's independence, adoption of the country's constitution and national symbols, and recognition by the most powerful countries in the world. 
Thaci pointed out that lobbying for recognition continues in close co-operation with Kosovo's western partners. 
Commenting on his earlier statement that 100 countries will recognise Kosovo by September, Thaci said this does not depend solely on Kosovo and its citizens.

MADRID, Spain -- Montenegrin war crimes suspect Veselin Vlahovic will remain in custody, a Spanish judge said on Friday (March 5th), a decision that gives Serbia, BiH and Montenegro 40 days to submit extradition requests. 
Vlahovic, detained in Spain last week, is accused of murder; rape and torture of non-Serbs while a member of a paramilitary unit from 1992 to 1993.

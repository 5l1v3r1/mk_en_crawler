BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele reiterated on Tuesday (March 30th) his concerns about the ongoing political stalemate in Albania. 
The deadlock is between the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP). 
"I expressed concern about the stability of democratic institutions and the lack of political dialogue in the parliament. 
All laws are adopted here, and there would be no reforms without appropriate legislation," Fuele said in an interview with EurActiv. 
DP has been refusing SP demands to investigate the June 2009 general elections, resulting in an SP boycott of most parliamentary sessions.

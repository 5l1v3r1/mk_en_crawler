TIRANA, Albania -- Yugoslav and Albanian business organisations on Friday (6 December) sealed a key agreement on co-operation and support. 
Bogoljub Karic, head of the Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Yugoslavia, and Luan Bregasi, chairman of the Union of Albanian Chambers of Commerce, signed the document in Tirana. 
Both sides said the agreement should help further enhance bilateral business relations. 
Some 100 Yugoslav businessmen will arrive in Albania in mid-January to look at investment opportunities, Bregasi said. 
Karic noted that Kosovo could be an important link for boosting business relations and economic co-operation between Yugoslavia and Albania.

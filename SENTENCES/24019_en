ZAGREB, Croatia -- Bar and restaurant owners launched a petition Wednesday (June 17th) to amend the law that bans smoking in public places.
Organisers hope to attract more than 30,000 signatures by June 30th.
They maintain that the new law is dragging their business to the brink of collapse.
Owners urged the government to ease the restrictions or face protests.
The new measures have also sparked protests among smokers, who account for a third of the population.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- New Serbia, one of the junior coalition partners, decided Tuesday (13 April) to nominate party leader Velimir Ilic for president. 
The election is scheduled for 13 June. 
Still unclear is whether the democratic ruling coalition, which meets Wednesday, would support Ilic's bid.
In other news, the trial of six men accused of murdering Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic resumed in Belgrade's special court on Tuesday, after more than three months. 
Seven other defendants are being tried in absentia, including the alleged mastermind of the plot, Milorad "Legija" Lukovic.

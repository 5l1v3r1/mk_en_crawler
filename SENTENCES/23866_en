ATHENS, Greece -- The long-awaited new Acropolis Museum was officially inaugurated on Saturday (June 20th) at a ceremony in Athens.
Greece's political leaders and hundreds of foreign dignitaries, artists and academics attended the ceremony.
The museum was intended to open in time for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but technical and bureaucratic hurdles delayed construction.
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cancelled a scheduled visit to Athens where he was supposed to attend the inauguration ceremony and meet with Greek counterpart Costas Karamanlis.
Athens says Erdogan cancelled due to health problems.

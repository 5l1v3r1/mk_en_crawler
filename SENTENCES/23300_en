ATHENS, Greece -- Unknown attackers firebombed Deputy Environment Minister Stavros Kaloyannis's car Friday (December 26th). 
It was parked outside his house in the north-western city of Ioannina, media reported. 
The petrol bomb and fire destroyed the car, but no injuries were reported.
In a separate incident, assailants threw a Molotov cocktail at a branch of the Greek Farm Bank in the Athens suburb of Psychiko, causing minor damage. 
Later Friday, youths attacked a police car passing an Athens hospital. 
The police officers fled and no one was injured. 
Attacks on banks and government property have increased since the killing of a 15-year-old boy by a police officer on December 6th, which triggered a wave of violent youth protests.

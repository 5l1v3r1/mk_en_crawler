SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's Ambassador to Belgium and NATO, Sven Alkalaj, has warned that the country stands little or no chance of entering the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme unless it co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
At a news conference in Brussels Sunday (28 November), Alkalaj said it was of the utmost importance for BiH to arrest and extradite indictees to The Hague tribunal as soon as possible.
In other news, local media in Banja Luka are reporting that Republika Srpska (RS) Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic has asked RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic to replace the head of the entity's police, Radomir Njegus, because of the police force's failure to conduct activities aimed at detaining war crimes indictees.

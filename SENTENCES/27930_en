PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former Kosovo Central Bank Governor Hashim Rexhepi has been released on 20,000 euro bail, his lawyer, Ram Gashi, confirmed on Friday (November 19th).
Rexhepi was arrested in July as part of a EULEX-led corruption investigation after information surfaced indicating abuse of power, bribery, tax evasion and money laundering.
Gashi said all accusations against his client are false and protested his long detention as "unlawful".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An international criminal group allegedly involved in fraud via the internet, identity document forgery and money laundering schemes, has been smashed in a joint operation by Bulgarian and US security services. 
Sofia city prosecutors issued a statement Friday (March 16th) that said the gang had been under surveillance since the beginning for the year, when American citizens complained that they had been defrauded during purchases via the internet. 
Five men were arrested in Bulgaria, including the alleged mastermind. 
More arrests may follow.

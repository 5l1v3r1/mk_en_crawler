ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed late on Wednesday (28 December) that the controversial Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, which restricts freedom of speech, could be amended in the near future. 
The measure has been used to prosecute a number of writers and journalists, including novelist Orhan Pamuk.
In other news, the interior ministry announced on Thursday that a major review of work by Turkish police -- especially the forces in Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara -- is under way. 
The goal is to implement improvements by the end of February.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker said on Friday (February 16th) that the international community largely backs the proposal by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari for resolving Kosovo's status issue, adding that it comes "at an ideal moment in history".
Ruecker commented during a visit to the Klina municipality, with Kosovo Parliament Speaker Kole Berisha and acting Kosovo Minister for Communities and Returns Branislav Grbic.
The UNMIK head called for a positive approach to the package proposed by Ahtisaari.
He urged anyone contemplating demonstrations to avoid violence.
During separate talks Friday, Ruecker assured local Serb returnees in Klina that the UN roadmap envisions institutional protections for them and encourages their participation in politics.

Belgrade leaders predict UN Security Council will reject Ahtisaari's proposal
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica expressed confidence Sunday (February 18th) that the UN Security Council would reject the proposal of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari as illegitimate, since it would lead to the partition of UN member Serbia.
Kostunica implied that he would rely on Russia and China to back Serbia's position when the Security Council discusses the issue.
On Saturday, outgoing Serbian Minister for State Administration and Local Self-government Zoran Loncar also predicted the Council would reject Ahtisaari's plan, as it would result in the loss of 15% of Serbia's territory.
For his part, however, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said on Friday that the international community would not let Russia thwart the adoption of the resolution at the Security Council.
Ceku said the Contact Group would not allow the status process to fail.

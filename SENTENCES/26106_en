ANKARA, Turkey -- Four men were killed Sunday (August 16th) in a shootout between two Kurdish families who have long quarrelled over a piece of land. 
The gunfight in the village of Buyuk Alanli, in the southeast province of Sanliurfa, took the lives of two members of each family. 
Local officials say the feud began 15 years ago and already claimed one victim, in 2007. 
Turkish paramilitary units were deployed to the village to prevent more violence. 
Shootouts between feuding families are common in southeast Turkey, where conflicts are often settled with weapons.

TIRANA, Albania -- Albania and Kosovo may be heading towards their first bilateral crisis involving their struggling energy production. 
A hydro-power plant is planned for construction in Zhurr, southern Kosovo. 
Experts from Pristina are already in the final stages of implementing the project and are close to awarding a contract to an investment company. 
However, on the other side of the border, authorities in Albania's northeast town of Kukes oppose the project because it may potentially divert waters where smaller hydro plants are planned to boost energy production. 
On Tuesday (August 31st), the Kukes Regional Council approved a contract with a group of private investors that will construct a hydro-power plant worth 13m euros. 
Both Albania and Kosovo have vowed that at least 20% of energy production will come from "clean" sources by 2020, in line with international standards.

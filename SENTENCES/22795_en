PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Ramush Haradinaj, leader of the Opposition for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) party, sent a letter to the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) on Monday (July 7th) accusing the current government of failing to muster greater international recognition and for allowing the situation in the north to deteriorate.
He advised President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci to work on an operational plan for managing the situation in the Serb-dominated northern part of Kosovo.
The lack of recognition of Kosovo's independence has also encouraged the young country's civil society to work on a joint project on lobbying for recognition.
A delegation will travel to Amman, Jordan, this weekend to begin lobbying.

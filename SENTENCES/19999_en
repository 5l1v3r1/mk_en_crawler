MOSCOW, Russia -- President Vladimir Putin and visiting Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis praised the current level of bilateral relations Tuesday (December 18th) and vowed to boost energy ties.
Putin stressed his appreciation for Greece's contribution to strengthening ties between Russia and the EU and later announced that Greece is interested in doubling its import of Russian gas.
"In order to increase volumes, there is a need for additional transport capacities," he said referring to a new gas link under the Black Sea called South Stream.
A protocol related to the separate Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline project was also sealed during Karamanlis' visit.
In Greece meanwhile, lawyers, medical personnel, pharmacists, engineers and journalists launched a 24-hour warning strike Tuesday;
a continuation of last week's protest against government plans to overhaul the pension system.
Unions plan another warning strike Thursday.

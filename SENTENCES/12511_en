SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Outgoing US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler has said the country must demonstrate zero tolerance for corruption and mediocrity if it wants to move closer to EU and NATO membership. 
In an interview with Macedonia's Albanian-language weekly Lobi, Butler said it is up to Macedonian citizens, with foreign assistance, to identify and tackle problems. 
He highlighted judicial and economic reforms as priorities, while reiterating the international community's stance that the 13 March local elections would be a crucial test for the country. 
Butler's mandate in Skopje is set to expire next month.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried met with leaders in Belgrade on Monday (March 5th) about the Kosovo status settlement process, bilateral ties and Serbia's Euro-Atlantic co-operation process. 
Fried said the United States and the international community expect constructive participation by Serbia in the final round of UN-mediated talks on Kosovo's status, scheduled for Saturday in Vienna. 
On Tuesday, Fried continued his tour of the region with a stop in northern Kosovo for talks with representatives of Serb municipalities.
UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari is expected to submit an amended draft proposal to Belgrade and Pristina on Tuesday or Wednesday, incorporating some of the issues raised during two weeks of talks that ended Friday in Vienna.

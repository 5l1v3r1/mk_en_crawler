TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE Presence and the Office of the Council of Europe in Tirana issued a joint statement Friday (4 February), expressing regret that domestic experts have been unable to reach a compromise on the redrawing of the election map, despite efforts by the international community. 
The two organisations also called on parties in parliament to work towards a solution and complete the election reform ahead of parliamentary elections later this year. 
The major opposition Democratic Party is demanding that the election be held in either late May or early June so it does not affect the summer tourist season.

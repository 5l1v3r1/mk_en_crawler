BUCHAREST, Romania -- Interior Minister Vasile Blaga said Thursday (24 February) that an anti-corruption department will be set up within his ministry. 
The new body will have judicial police powers, enabling it to start investigations when corruption complaints are filed. 
Blaga said the unit will be instrumental in helping the country meet its obligations to fight corruption. 
The new department will be modelled after the British police, who have criminal investigation jurisdiction.

They will be assigned to Blaga, the Customs Directorate and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu. 
During a meeting with Tariceanu, the advisers presented what they hope to achieve and what measures should be implemented.

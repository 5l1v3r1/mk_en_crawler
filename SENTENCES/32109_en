ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (14 November) requested help from the Croatian government in organising interviews between tribunal representatives and two Croatian suspects.
The media cites sources who identify the two as retired generals Mladen Markac, a former Croatian special police forces commander, and Ivan Korade, commander of the Seventh brigade.
Meanwhile, former Croatian Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko, who is wanted for crimes against humanity by prosecutors at The Hague, was reported in critical condition on Friday.
A physician told reporters that the 83-year-old retired general is bedridden, but able to talk.

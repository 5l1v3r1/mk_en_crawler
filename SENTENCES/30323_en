ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament adopted a law Friday (May 13th) that removes time limitations for crimes involving illegal profiting from war and privatisation.
The law provides for the persecution of multiple crimes committed during both war times and peaceful reintegration, as well as acts that pose an immediate threat to the country's independence and territorial integrity.
Among the crimes related to privatisation, the law mentions deliberate cause of bankruptcy, abuse of office and power, signing disadvantageous contracts, prohibited trade, tax evasion and fraud.
Crimes related to illegal profiting from war include price gouging for scarce food products and selling properties for well over their market value.

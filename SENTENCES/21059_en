SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Rumen Petkov says Bulgaria plans to invest approximately 161m euros in the next two years to meet requirements to join the Schengen area. 
At a news conference Friday (February 1st), Petkov stressed he is confident Bulgaria will enter the Schengen common border control and visa space by the March 2011 target date. 
He noted that while the government has already spent 77m euros to boost border security, efforts are needed to further tighten control on borders with Turkey, Serbia and Macedonia. 
Most of the funds would be used to modernise border check-points and train border personnel.

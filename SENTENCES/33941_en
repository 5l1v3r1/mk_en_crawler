ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish government has decided not to send its troops to the international mission for the reconstruction of post-war Iraq, foreign ministry spokesman Huseyin Dirioz announced on Friday (7 November).According to Dirioz, the decision was spurred by the Iraqi Interim Governing Council's opposition to a deployment of Turkish peacekeepers, as well as by the recent consultations with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
Iraqi Interim Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari characterised the decision as a wise and rational one on the part of Turkey, adding that it would create a strong base for the development of good relations between the two neighbouring countries.

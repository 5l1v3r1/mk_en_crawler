BUCHAREST, Romania -- Incumbent President Traian Basescu of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) was sworn in to a second term in office on Monday (December 21st). 
During his inauguration speech, he once again embraced a programme of change and reforms, similar to the start of his term in late 2004. 
"My goal will be to modernise Romania," Basescu, 58, stressed, explaining that "this means turning [Romania's] formal EU membership into an everyday reality for all Romanians." He also indicated he expects parliament to approve the new cabinet, led by Prime Minister-Designate Emil Boc, when it comes before lawmakers for a vote of confidence Wednesday.
But the National Liberal Party (PNL) announced on Monday it has no intention of supporting the new government. 
It says its members in parliament will vote against the cabinet for the same reasons they did during a vote of confidence last month that Boc lost, bringing down the government. 
This time, however, the PDL and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, the parties comprising the new cabinet, seem to have enough support to survive the vote of confidence. 
Its ruling majority, however, will be very slim.

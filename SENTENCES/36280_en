PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Thousands of people Sunday (30 May) attended the funeral of Dusko Jovanovic, editor of Dan, who was assassinated on Friday.
On Saturday, an estimated 5,000 people marched through the Montenegrin capital to protest his killing.
Dan is the republic's main opposition daily.
In a special Sunday edition, the newspaper blamed the government for the murder, saying Jovanovic had received numerous death threats because of the newspaper's reports on official involvement in corruption and crime.
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic condemned the killing and urged police to find the perpetrators.
So far, the vehicle and weapon have been recovered.

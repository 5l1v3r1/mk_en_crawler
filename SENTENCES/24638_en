ATHENS, Greece -- The parliament approved on Friday (December 5th) a law that will release 3,270 prisoners as part of an agreement last month that ended an 18-day hunger strike by inmates protesting poor conditions in local detention facilities.
"We have fulfilled our promise to give prisoners a second chance," Justice Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis said.
International human rights watchdog Amnesty International said recently that Greek inmates suffer from overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions and frequent violence.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A bomb blast ripped through a city bus, killing two people and injuring seven others in Istanbul on Thursday (24 June), just days before heads of state arrive in the country for the NATO summit, Turkish television said.
According to CNN Turk, the bus was passing in front of a hospital in a residential district of Istanbul when the blast occurred.
Earlier Thursday, a small parcel bomb exploded outside the Hilton Hotel in Ankara, where leaders including US President George W. Bush are due to stay Saturday night, prior to attending the summit in Istanbul.
That blast wounded three people.
The Turkish government moved to reassure the public on security arrangements for the summit, which begins Monday.
"Turkey is a sufficiently strong and secure country.
Such incidents happen everywhere, in London, in Paris, everywhere," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told reporters, adding that the Bush visit would go ahead as scheduled.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Activists covered Kosovo's independence symbol "Newborn" with a black cloth on Saturday (December 19th), to protest the country's exclusion from visa liberalisation that took effect for neighbouring Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. 
Some NGOs urged the EU to review its policy towards Kosovo, to prevent the young country from becoming a "black hole" in the region. 
Ramadan Ilazi, of the organisation Fol 09, accused the EU of hypocrisy, as the two required criteria for visa liberalisation, involving borders and the rule of law, are the responsibility of international institutions, rather than Kosovo authorities.

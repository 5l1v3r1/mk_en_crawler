BUCHAREST, Romania -- At the request of Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, President Traian Basescu decided on Wednesday (December 6th) to form an inquiry commission to investigate alleged government links to an ongoing privatisation scandal. 
The panel would check whether Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy and former Economy Minister Codrut Seres provided confidential information about future privatisation deals to a Bulgarian working for a Western consulting company in Bucharest.
Later Wednesday, Seres, who resigned this week when his Conservative Party quit the cabinet, dismissed the accusations as a "political game".

TIRANA, Albania -- The Czech Republic says it will support Albania's EU integration efforts during its presidency of the bloc, this first half of 2009.
Czech Ambassador to Tirana Marketa Fialkova met with Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Wednesday (January 7th) and gave assurances.
Berisha said his government intends to apply for candidate status during this term and will deepen reforms and guarantee free elections.
Also Wednesday, the government set January 12th as the first day for citizens to apply for electronic ID cards, which it will issue eight days after an application.
The cabinet also decided on Wednesday to adopt a draft law on establishing an Institute for Studying Crimes and Consequences of Communism in Albania.
Under the bill, February 20th will become the day to remember victims of communism.
An obelisk honouring them will rise in one of Tirana's main squares.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Thursday (15 May), parliament approved the amended law on criminal procedures. 
Under the new procedures, requests from an international court to surrender foreign nationals should be addressed to the prosecutor general, while sentencing requests should be directed to the minister of justice. 
The state could refuse to surrender a foreign national if the case involves a political crime, military crimes not considered crimes under general criminal law, or if the case involves prosecution for religious and ethnic or political beliefs.

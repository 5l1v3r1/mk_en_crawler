BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO defence ministers called for flexibility Thursday (8 June) regarding the course of the Kosovo status talks.
They urged both Belgrade and Pristina to co-operate in a constructive manner with UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
Meeting in Brussels, the ministers also announced that NATO's 17,000-strong peacekeeping mission in Kosovo would stay there as long as necessary and would react to any security threat in the province.
NATO also decided to substantially increase its International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
That means most Southeast European countries would have to consider boosting their ISAF participation as well.
Macedonian Defence Minister Jovan Manasijevski says his country's contingent likely will be tripled.

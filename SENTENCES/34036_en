ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament's justice commission approved the 7th EU legal harmonisation package on Monday (28 July).
The reform package limits the political role of the military-dominated National Security Council, transforming it from an executive body into an advisory one.
Its meetings will be held every two months, as opposed to monthly.
The package also stipulates that its secretary general will be proposed by the prime minister and approved by the president.
Gen Mustafa Agaoglu, the chief adviser to the secretary general of the council, expressed objections to the reforms.
After Monday's justice commission meeting, he said the council "has fallen and has been abrogated".

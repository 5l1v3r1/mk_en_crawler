BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's special prosecutor for war crimes acknowledged for the first time Wednesday (29 December) that many Kosovo Albanians were executed by Yugoslav forces during the 1998-1999 conflict. 
Vladimir Vukcevic told reporters that bombs had not killed 800 people whose bodies were exhumed from a mass grave in Batajnica, as authorities in Belgrade had contended. 
Autopsies instead confirmed they were victims of mass executions. 
He added that prosecutors are investigating reports that Kosovo Albanians were cremated in Serbian factories in 1999.
In other news, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica announced that the government has decided to establish a Council for Kosovo and a State Fund for Kosovo. 
He said the fund would provide assistance for the return and safety of Kosovo Serbs. 
Private donations from citizens and the Serbian diaspora will fund the effort.

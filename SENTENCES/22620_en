PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former UN deputy special envoy to Kosovo Albert Rohan warned on Tuesday (April 8th) that the plan for Kosovo's supervised independence was on the verge of failure.
"There is no turning back from Kosovo's independence, but I am not happy with the ethnic segregation in Kosovo," Rohan said.
"Belgrade is manipulating and financing Kosovo Serbs while the aim is to create a Serb entity in Kosovo."
Also Tuesday, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said UNMIK would decide whether to allow Serbia to extend its May 11th elections to voters in northern Kosovo.
"It is the first time that these elections take place after independence, and we will see how UNMIK will manage," Solana was quoted as saying by Kosovo media.

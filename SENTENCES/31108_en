BELGRADE, Serbia -- Initial talks between Belgrade and Pristina could start by the end of this year, Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said in an interview with Beta on Saturday (December 4th). 
He acknowledged that actual negotiations could only be expected after the formation of a government in Pristina following the December 12th snap elections. 
Bogdanovic conceded that the negotiations will inevitably touch on the Kosovo status issue. 
He added that Belgrade has drafted a platform for the talks, but would not reveal any details. 
He did say however that the Serbian negotiating team will include Kosovo Serb representatives, actively involved in all working groups discussing life in northern Kosovo.

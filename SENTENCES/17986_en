ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish police have arrested a 17-year-old man in connection with the murder of journalist Hrant Dink, one of the country's most prominent ethnic Armenians. 
The suspect, identified as Ogun Samast, was picked up in the Black Sea town of Samsun. 
He was still carrying the gun with which he shot Dink in front of his office in Istanbul on Friday (19 January). 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised the quick action by police, who have arrested six others in connection with the murder.
Thousands of people, meanwhile, gathered in Istanbul to protest the killing and to bid farewell to a man who was known for trying to promote better understanding between Armenians and Turks. 
The EU, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the United States and Armenia expressed shock and condemned the murder. 
The international community called on Ankara to fully investigate the crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, while stressing the need for taking measures to guarantee freedom of expression.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Tuesday (June 16th) a court in the town of Kyustendil released alleged mafia bosses Plamen Galev and Angel Hristov, known as the Galevi brothers.
They were in custody on charges of organised crime, blackmail, assault, harassment and racketeering.
The two were set free after the central electoral bureau allowed them to run in the upcoming parliamentary elections on July 5th.
Provisions in the electoral legislation allow people that are not yet convicted to run for parliament, and give them immunity for the duration of the campaign.
Both will stand as candidates in single-seat constituencies -- Galev in Kyustendil, and Hristov in Pernik.
In other news, about 2,000 state employees rallied Tuesday in downtown Sofia to ask for higher wages and protested against the planned freezing of budget sector salaries due to the economic crisis.
Industrial and steel workers, miners, farmers, teachers, doctors and students participated in the protest in front of the government's headquarters.

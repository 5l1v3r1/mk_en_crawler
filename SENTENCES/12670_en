VIENNA, Austria -- Austria has voiced support for Croatia's EU integration and its aspirations to start accession talks early next year. 
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel expressed hope that the country would be given a date at the European Council summit later this month. 
He added that the start of Croatia's talks would have a significant impact on other countries in the region, encouraging them to continue with reforms. 
A new survey conducted in Croatia suggests support for EU membership is growing: 52 per cent back EU entry, 4 per cent higher than a month ago. 
However, the number of those who oppose it -- 43 per cent -- is also higher than a month ago, while the percentage of those who are undecided has dropped.

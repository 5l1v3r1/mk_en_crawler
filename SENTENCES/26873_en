THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is refusing to co-operate with his court-appointed defence attorney, a legal adviser to the war crimes suspect announced on Friday (December 4th). 
Karadzic has filed a request to dismiss lawyer Richard Harvey, adviser Peter Robinson announced. 
He added that Karadzic has no problems with Harvey as a lawyer or as a person, but wants to "pick someone from the region â€¦ someone who shares the same heritage as him, the same language". 
Harvey was only appointed because Karadzic kept boycotting the early sessions of his trial.

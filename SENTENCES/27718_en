ATHENS, Greece -- Railway transportation will be seriously disrupted this week due to a four-day strike against a project to privatise the money-losing Greek railway operator OSE. 
The action starts on Monday (October 25th) and continues through Wednesday. 
It will stop for a day Thursday and resume on Friday. 
Authorities have promised to secure buses to move stranded tourists and others around. 
Railway workers held a strike earlier this month to protest government plans to privatise the OSE. 
A new bill on the company's privatisation is expected to be submitted to parliament on Monday.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister George Papandreou promised on Sunday that there would be no new pay cuts or tax hikes. 
"Whatever happens, there will be no additional burdens on salary earners and pensioners, and no rise in tax rates beyond what we have pledged," Papandreou said in an article he wrote for the To Vima newspaper.

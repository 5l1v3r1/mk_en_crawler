TIRANA, Albania -- European Commission Delegation chief Helmuth Lohan and German Ambassador to Tirana Hans-Peter Annen called on all political parties Thursday (October 26th) to help prepare for municipal elections this winter. 
At separate meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Rusmajli and the leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, Edi Rama, the diplomats stressed that Union would be monitoring the vote closely, in the context of Tirana's bid for EU integration. 
The main parties are still squabbling over the exact date of the elections.

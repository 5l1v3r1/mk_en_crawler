BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Serbian electoral commission Thursday (17 October) rejected the appeal filed by Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) against the decision to annul last Sunday's presidential run-off. 
The DSS argued that the voter lists contained more than 600,000 non-existent voters and that turnout at the elections had therefore exceeded the required 50 per cent minimum. 
The DSS now has 48 hours to appeal before the Serbian Supreme Court.
In other news, Serbia's Parliament cancelled a session on amendments to the election laws. 
Lawmakers were to have met Friday to debate eliminating the 50 per cent turnout requirement. 
The session was called off amid uncertainties about the status of 45 deputies from the DSS, who were reinstated to parliament by the Yugoslav Supreme Court on Wednesday.

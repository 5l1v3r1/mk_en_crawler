PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- President Vaclav Klaus voiced support Tuesday (February 8th) for Macedonia's bid to join the EU. 
After talks with Macedonian counterpart Gjorge Ivanov in Prague, Klaus said the EU should take a more active role in finding a solution to the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece. 
Ivanov agreed and said he hopes that a meeting Wednesday between UN mediator Matthew Nimetz and Macedonian and Greek representatives Zoran Jolevski and Adamantios Vassilakis will be constructive. 
During Ivanov's visit to Prague, the countries signed an agreement on co-operation in the fields of education and science.

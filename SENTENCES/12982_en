SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Three centre-right parties in Bulgaria formally sealed a pre-election coalition agreement Monday (28 February) ahead of the parliamentary vote later this year.
The new coalition includes the Union of Free Democrats, the Bulgarian Agriculture People's Union-People's Union and the nationalist VMRO-BND.
Last week, three other centre-right parties signed a similar coalition deal:
the Union of Democratic Forces, the Democratic Party and St. George's Day.
Also Monday, Norway announced plans to assist with Bulgariaâs judicial reform.
The pledge came during a visit by Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.

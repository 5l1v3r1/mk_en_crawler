ATHENS, Greece -- A direct phone hotline between the Greek and Turkish Air Forces' headquarters, in Larissa and Eski Sehir respectively, started operating on Sunday (2 July). 
The establishment of the line represents one of the measures aimed at preventing incidents like the deadly air collision over the Aegean Sea in May. 
A ban on conducting such military exercises in the Aegean took effect on 1 July and will remain in effect until 15 September.

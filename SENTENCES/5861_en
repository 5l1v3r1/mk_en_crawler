It's a task of herculean proportions. 
To meet EU specifications, Bulgaria must ensure that the share of energy generated from wind, solar and other green sources will reach 16% of the country's gross final energy consumption by 2020.
The technical potential is sufficient, the country insists in its National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), finalised in late June 2010.
"It is absolutely certain that Bulgaria will meet its targets," Energy Minister Traicho Traikov said, adding that the government is working to ensure this happens at an affordable price.
The authorities have introduced various incentives, including preferential prices, priority connection of producers of electricity from RES to the power grid and obligatory purchase of electricity from such sources, to attract green energy investments.
Under amendments to the law on renewable energy in late 2008, the duration of agreements with producers of electricity from geothermal and solar energy was extended from 12 to 25 years. 
The duration of agreements with producers of electricity from other renewable sources was extended from 12 to 15 years.
Numerous foreign companies have since rushed to build wind and solar power plants in Bulgaria. 
While the government voices confidence, some analysts are less bullish. 
They say the country's green capacity falls short of what's needed.
"Bulgaria is definitely not going to meet its 2011 target -- and unless it boosts wind and solar power capacity, it will miss its 2020 target too," Momchil Merkulov of the Association of Producers of Ecological Energy told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the country's aging power grid poses a challenge. 
Energy officials acknowledge that if more than 2,000 MW in new solar, wind and hydro power is installed by 2020, the country's electricity grid could collapse, jeopardising supply.
"We encourage RES growth, but the sector should develop in a way that does not create environmental problems and risks," Deputy Environment Minister Evdokiya Maneva said.
According to the NREAP paper, in 2010 the overall share of renewable energy sources (RES) used in heating and cooling, electricity and transport stood at 10% of total consumption, up from 9.2% in 2005, which is used as a base year.
It is projected to reach 10.7% this year, when the share of RES in electricity production alone is expected to hit the 11% target set by the EU.
EU statistics showed that a total of 120MW of wind power capacity was installed from 2007 to 2009, bringing the total to 177MW, which grew to 336MW in 2010, and is expected to reach 1,250MW by 2020.
Meanwhile, solar energy capacity grew from 1.4MW in 2008 to 15MW in 2010. 
Industry representatives believe installed photovoltaic capacity, which is used for electricity generation, as well as for heating and cooling, could reach 100MW this year.
According to the NREAP, solar capacity in Bulgaria is to reach 330 MW by 2020.
Wind and solar power have a much smaller share in the production of energy from RES in Bulgaria as compared with hydro power and biomass, which account for about 31% and 36%, respectively.
Biomass and and geothermal energy are both used used for electricity generation, as well as for heating and cooling.
By 2008, Bulgaria was already utilising in full its existing hydro power potential, while only a portion of its solid biomass potential was being used, primarily for heating in households and in public buildings, according to the NREAP.

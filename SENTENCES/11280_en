BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Nebojsa Pavkovic, the former chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, has agreed to surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal, the Serbian government announced Friday (22 April).
The general has been indicted for atrocities committed by Serbian forces under his command during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.
He is due to travel to The Hague on Monday.
The news comes as EU foreign ministers prepare to discuss and vote Monday on the European Commission's feasibility report for Serbia-Montenegro.
Also on Friday, a spokesman for the UN war crimes tribunal said Slobodan Milosevic has recovered from recent problems with high blood pressure and would appear before the tribunal Monday.
Hearings were adjourned for a week after doctors said the former Yugoslav president was in danger of a heart attack.

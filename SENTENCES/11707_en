BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- At a news conference Monday (20 June), Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said all war crimes indictees located in Serbia would be arrested and extradited to the UN tribunal. 
He added that the "voluntary surrender" model is no longer working and that surrender deadlines had already expired. 
He said it is just a matter of time before the remaining fugitives are located and apprehended.
In other news Monday, Rene van der Linden, president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), delivered an opening speech to the annual PACE session in Strasbourg. 
He expressed deep regret over the Serbian Parliament's failure last week to condemn the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, despite the release of a videotape recording the execution of Bosniak civilians by Serbian paramilitary troops.

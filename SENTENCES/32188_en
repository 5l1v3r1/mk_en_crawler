SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe (SEE) will provide any kind of assistance that the democratically elected government of Macedonia might need to continue reforms, declared the Pact's Special Co-ordinator, Erhard Busek. 
He visited Skopje on Wednesday (9 October), meeting with President Boris Trajkovski and the leaders of the parties that will likely form the new coalition cabinet. 
Busek commended last month's successful elections and stressed the importance of Macedonia's stabilisation process to the entire region.
Meanwhile on Thursday, negotiating teams from the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and the Democratic Union for Integration were expected to resume talks on forming a coalition government. 
The two sides reportedly have not yet discussed actual ministerial candidates.

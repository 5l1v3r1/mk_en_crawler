BERLIN, Germany -- Turkey's accession to the EU would present "a historic opportunity to build a bridge to the Islamic world", German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Friday (26 November), again signalling Berlin's support for the launch of accession talks with Ankara. 
EU leaders are due to meet on 17 December to decide whether Turkey has met the criteria for the opening of negotiations in 2005.

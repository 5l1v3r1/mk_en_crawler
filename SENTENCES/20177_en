BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling National Liberal Party decided on Thursday (October 18th) to revoke the membership of former Agriculture Minister Decebal Traian Remes for at least one year.
Remes resigned under pressure a week ago, amid allegations he took a 15,000-euro bribe from a local businessman.
Separately Thursday, the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided to send the so-called Zambaccian case back to the National Anti-corruption Department for additional investigation.
At issue are allegations against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, who is accused of blackmail, influence peddling and accepting bribes.
His wife, Dana, is charged as well.
The trial against Nastase was suspended in March and referred to the Constitutional Court, after Supreme Court judges agreed some articles of the laws of ministerial responsibility may be unconstitutional.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, proclaimed "Christ Has Risen" at midnight on Saturday (26 April) to announce the start of Easter celebrations. 
"May the Risen Lord heal all brokenness of contemporary humanity and grant peace and life to all human beings, removing all hatred and bloodshed, and exchanging them with peaceful co-operation for the good of all," he said as the bells of the Cathedral of St. 
George in Istanbul began to ring and worshippers lit candles. 
There are 14 independent Eastern Orthodox Churches around the world, including in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Albania.

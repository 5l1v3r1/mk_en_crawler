PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX officials want Belgrade to take the next step in collecting information regarding the Raska mass grave, believed to contain the bodies of 250 Albanians. 
"This case is important, and we encourage Belgrade authorities to move forward as soon as possible in order to shed light on the truth," EULEX spokeswoman Irina Gudeljevic told Serbian news agencies Sunday (June 13th). 
Serbian authorities announced the existence of the Raska mass grave in May. 
Working groups from Belgrade and Pristina met earlier this month to discuss the technicalities involved in exhumations.

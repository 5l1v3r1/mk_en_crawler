PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Hilmi Jashari, deputy Kosovo ombudsman, was appointed as acting ombudsman by UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen, according to local media reports Thursday (29 December).
Jashari will succeed Marek Antoni Nowicki in the position on 1 January.
In an interview with the BCC, Jashari stressed that he will treat all people as equals, making no distinction between Serbs and Albanians.
Kosovo Serbs say a foreigner should have remained as ombudsman.
Also Thursday, KFOR and UN police announced they have tightened security in northern Kosovo, in response to two shootings and a grenade attack in Mitrovica earlier this week.

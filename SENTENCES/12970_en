BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country changed its currency at midnight on Thursday (30 June) as part of efforts to prepare its economy for EU membership in 2007.
The denomination will transform 10,000 units of the old currency into one new unit, popularly referred to as "the heavy leu".
The new bills and coins will circulate with the old ones until the end of 2006.
Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu said the move marked the end of high inflation, which reached 9.3 per cent during 2004.
The government has set a target of 7.5 per cent for this year.
President Traian Basescu was the first to withdraw new leu from a Bucharest ATM at midnight.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) said in a report Tuesday (August 25th) that violations marred the June 28th general elections, which it says failed to meet international standards.
The panel says that in some municipalities, family members were allowed to enter the voting booths together and vote as a group, rather than separately, a trend that was tolerated by regional polling stations' commissions.
The AHC also criticised the Central Election Commission for announcing results before all the votes were counted.
The AHC had 150 monitors deployed during the election.

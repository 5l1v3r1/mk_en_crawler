TIRANA, Albania -- The state-owned power utility KESH announced on Monday (August 11th) that it has cut electricity supplies to Kosovo due to the drought in Albania and concerns over a new energy shortage similar to the one last year. 
Supplies to neighbouring Kosovo were cut a couple of days ago in an effort to meet growing local demand amid the peak holiday season.
In other news, mission chief Robert Bosch said on Sunday that ending the OSCE mission in Albania is the responsibility of the central OSCE authority and Finland, the current holder of the rotating OSCE Chairmanship. 
The government has recently urged the mission to limit some aspects of its mandate.

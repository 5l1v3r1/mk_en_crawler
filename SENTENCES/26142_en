PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia held early local elections Sunday (August 16th) in two Serb-dominated municipalities in Pec and Pristina. 
Voting in the two enclaves, Gracanica and Gorazdevac, went without incident, but turnout was low. 
The Serbian Progressive Party won 34% of the votes while the coalition led by Socialist Party of Serbia garnered 24%, according to preliminary results. 
The government announced the elections in the two municipalities in early April, citing alleged embezzlement by local officials and a lack of co-ordination with the Serbian Ministry for Kosovo. 
Kosovo institutions allowed Belgrade to organise the vote but declared it illegal and invalid.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot Communist Party (AKEL), a partner in the ruling coalition, has decided to run its own candidate in the next presidential elections, expected to take place in February 2008. 
At a party congress Sunday (July 8th), AKEL tapped party Secretary-General Demetris Christofias as their nominee, regardless of the position of the other two partners in the coalition government -- incumbent President Tassos Papadopoulos' DIKO and EDEK. 
Papadopoulos may seek a second term.

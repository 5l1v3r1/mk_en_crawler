BUCHAREST, Romania -- Britain will remove its visa requirements for all Romanian nationals as the country moves towards membership in the EU, the British ambassador to Bucharest said on Monday (October 2nd). 
In a speech to a group of college students, Robin Barnett said Romanians could travel to Britain without restrictions after 1 January. 
However, he cautioned, Britain is unlikely to open up its labour market to workers from Bulgaria and Romania, as it did with the previous ten new member-states.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski warned on Monday (26 June) that campaign violence in the run-up to the 5 July election is hurting the country.
Macedonia needs "fair and democratic elections," he said at a rally in Bitolja, adding that he is not interested in a victory achieved by violence.
His remarks followed warnings from the United States and the EU that the unrest is damaging Skopje's chances of joining NATO and the EU.
State Electoral Commission chairman Jovan Josifovski also issued a statement Monday, blaming campaign-related violence on ineffectiveness by the interior ministry, police and prosecutors.

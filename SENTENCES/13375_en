SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament began discussing the performance of the cabinet on Thursday (22 September), with a view to conducting a no confidence vote. 
The parliamentary parties have agreed that the opposition will have twice as much time to support its arguments than the ruling coalition during the debate. 
This would be the first no confidence vote Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's cabinet has faced. 
The opposition hopes to lure dissatisfied deputies from the ruling coalition to their side and topple the government.

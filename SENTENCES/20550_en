BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors need parliamentary approval to launch corruption investigations against former and current ministers who are members of parliament (MPs), the Constitutional Court ruled on Monday (March 10th).
For their part Monday, MPs endorsed a law that allows anti-graft prosecutors to investigate ministers who are also MPs only with the consent of the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate. 
Thus, if a government member who has been entangled in a criminal probe is a member of the Chamber of Deputies or a senator, the justice minister or the prime minister must require the approval of the relevant chamber of parliament to launch the investigation.

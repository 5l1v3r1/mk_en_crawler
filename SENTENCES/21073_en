ATHENS, Greece -- Torrential rains closed roads and flooded houses on the Kassandra peninsula in Greece's Halkidiki on Sunday (September 2nd). 
About 85km from Thessaloniki, cars floated in flood waters and some ended up being washed into the sea. 
Damaging hail was also reported. 
Large parts of Alexandrupolis were affected by the floods, which caused power cuts.
Meanwhile, firefighters hope that a front moving towards the Peloponnese peninsula will help them douse devastating wildfires there. 
The death toll from those fires has climbed to 65, as a man died from burns in hospital. 
The last of the big fires has been contained. 
Planes and helicopter doused Mount Parnon with water on Sunday to put out one that was rekindled by strong winds, forcing the evacuation of two villages.

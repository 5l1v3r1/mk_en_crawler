LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Democracy is functioning and the opposition's boycott will not hinder Albania's road to EU integration, President Bamir Topi said on Tuesday (October 13th) during a visit to Slovenia. 
"Democracy functions in Albania, and its institutions are quickly consolidating," he added.
Elsewhere, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli urged opposition lawmakers on Tuesday to return to parliament, assuring them that the majority will respect the constitution. 
Lawmakers from the Socialist Party (SP) have been boycotting the work of parliament demanding a thorough investigation into the June 28th parliamentary elections that they insist were manipulated. 
Opposition parties are working to collect 20,000 signatures on a petition, seeking an investigation into the election process.

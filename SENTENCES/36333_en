HELSINKI, Finland -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri announced his resignation Tuesday (25 May), amid criticism in the wake of violent ethnic clashes earlier this year.
Holkeri, 67, was due to finish his year-long mandate in August, but came under pressure from both inside and outside Kosovo to step down after the deadly clashes in March.
Earlier in the day, a UN official in Kosovo said "no one would be surprised" if Holkeri, who was to hold a news conference in Helsinki later, stepped down.
Ethnic Albanian government sources said they also believed he would leave the job.
Earlier this month, Holkeri was treated in a hospital in France for fatigue.
He went to Finland last week for medical checks, sparking fresh speculation he would not complete his term.
In other news, the process of repairing and rebuilding houses in Kosovo that primarily belong to Serbs began Monday.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova personally laid the cornerstone of a Serb house in Fushe Kosove and Vushtrri.
He pledged that the government remains committed to repairing Serb homes destroyed during the March violence.

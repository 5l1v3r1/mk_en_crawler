ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities announced on Saturday (10 May) that they would pay about $54,000 for information leading to the arrest of retired Gen Ante Gotovina, a Croatian wartime commander wanted for atrocities committed against Serbs during the 1991-1995 war. 
Gotovina went into hiding two years ago. 
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has accused the Croatian government of not doing enough to arrest him.

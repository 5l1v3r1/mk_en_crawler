SKOPJE, Macedonia -- International representatives voiced concern Tuesday (April 27th) about recent statements by political leaders who mention separatism, conflicts, and abandonment of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
In a joint statement, the heads of missions of the EU, NATO, the OSCE and the US in Skopje said they are worried too about the lack of political dialogue.
The ambassadors called on all party leaders to stick to the Ohrid Agreement and remain committed to Euro-Atlantic integration.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH plans to ratchet up the pressure on wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's network of supporters. 
OHR spokesman Julian Braithwaite said Thursday (16 January) that sanctions are being prepared against those helping the major war crimes suspect move freely in Republika Srpska (RS) some seven years after the Dayton peace accords.
In other news, the head of the RS government's Bureau for Relations with the UN war crimes tribunal, Dejan Miletic, announced Thursday that the tribunal has approved initiation of legal procedures against nine people, Bosniaks and Croats, charged with war crimes. 
Proceedings will also be launched against several Serbs accused of anti-Catholic crimes during the war.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has turned down Bosnian Serb Milan Lukic's request to be temporarily released from prison, media reported on Monday (August 31st). 
In July, he was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Bosnian Muslim civilians in the town of Visegrad, from 1992 to 1994. 
Lukic had asked the tribunal for five days to visit his parents in Belgrade. 
The tribunal denied the request, saying there are no guarantees he would return to The Hague afterwards.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Acting Serbian President Dragan Marsicanin said Tuesday (10 February) that prospects for forming a coalition government are fading and new elections were becoming more likely.
He urged the parties to try to resolve their differences and agree on the formation of a government over the next few days.
They have been trying to do so since elections six weeks ago.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader is again denying accusations stemming from the Austrian Hypo Alpe Adria Banka. 
In a statement to the Austrian news agency APA on Thursday (August 19th), Sanader said he never accepted commissions in exchange for bank loan approvals. 
"I never knowingly favoured anyone in the affairs of the Croatian government," Sanader stressed. 
His response came amid media claims that he is being investigated for allegedly receiving hundreds of thousands of euros in the 1990s from Croatian firms to ensure they received loans from Hypo Alpe Adria Banka. 
The bank, which racked up losses from bad loans in Eastern Europe, was nationalised in December. 
Its former chief executive, Wolfgang Kulterer, was arrested last week. 
Croatian state prosecutors say they are co-operating closely with Austrian authorities in investigating Hypo's business in Croatia.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A parliamentary committee has approved a bill that could grant the government the authority to block access to websites that publish content insulting the memory of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the modern Turkish republic. 
The move comes weeks after a court ordered access to YouTube blocked over videos containing unfavourable comments about Ataturk. 
That ban lasted just two days. 
Any attempt to pass the new legislation could lead to problems in Turkey's EU accession talks.
In other news, two Turkish engineers were kidnapped in Nigeria, according to local police on Saturday (April 7th). 
The men, who work for an Italian oil firm, were abducted while driving to a meeting in the city of Port Harcourt. 
Many kidnapping victims in Nigeria are released in exchange for ransoms.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has turned down Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj's request to disqualify two judges from ruling on his second proceeding on contempt charges. 
The court announced on Thursday (November 25th) that Seselj's motion against judges O-Gon Kwon and Kevin Parker is groundless. 
He had accused the pair of lacking impartiality, as they had already been part of a chamber that sentenced him to 15 months in prison on separate contempt charges. 
Seselj was charged in February for revealing in a book the identity of 11 protected witnesses at his war crimes trial. 
He faces separate charges for war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

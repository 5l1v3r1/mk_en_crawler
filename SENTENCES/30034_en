PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Deputy Prime Minister Edita Tahiri was selected Thursday (February 24th) as the country's chief negotiator in upcoming talks with Serbia. 
EU Special Representative in Kosovo Pieter Feith welcomed Tahiri's appointment but Belgrade interpreted it as a sign that Pristina does not view the dialogue as only technical, given Tahiri's position as deputy prime minister.

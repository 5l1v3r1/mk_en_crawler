ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU Council of Ministers authorised the European Commission on Monday (14 April) to evaluate Croatia's application for joining the Union. 
The final decision on the start of accession talks with Croatia is expected early next year.
Meanwhile, Zagreb county prosecutor Krunoslav Canjuga resigned Monday, following criticism from chief prosecutor Mladen Bajic. 
Canjuga denied press reports that his name had surfaced during the wiretapping of suspected criminals, but said he would not stay on the job if not trusted.

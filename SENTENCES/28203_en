PRISTINA, Kosovo -- War crimes suspect Vukomir Cvetkovic was ordered detained for 30 days by the District Court in Peja/Pec, western Kosovo, on Wednesday (July 14th).
A mixed panel of prosecutors attended the session;
the judge was a EULEX representative.
Cvetkovic is suspected of committing war crimes in March 1999.
The Council for Human Rights and Freedoms filed a lawsuit immediately after the war, accusing him of participating in Serb paramilitary forces and committing crimes against Albanians in Peja/Pec.
Cvetkovic's lawyer said that witnesses claim his client burned two houses belonging to Albanians and expelled people living in them, but had no links to any murder.
Cvetkovic was extradited from Norway on Tuesday after being arrested in March 2009.

LONDON, Great Britain -- British embassies in Sofia and Bucharest announced on Wednesday (31 March) that they have suspended the issuance of all types of visas for Bulgarian and Romanian citizens.
The announcement follows a recent scandal in which a diplomat in Bucharest admitted that embassy personnel granted business visas to Romanian citizens, despite knowing that the submitted documents were falsified.
The same diplomat described similar practices in Bulgaria.
Embassies in the two countries said they are now issuing visas in emergency cases only, pending new procedural instructions.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The prime ministers and presidents of Republika Srpska (RS) and Serbia signed an agreement Tuesday (26 September) on special parallel relations between the BiH entity and Serbia. 
The agreement represents the extension of a deal signed in 2001. 
The Serbian leaders were accompanied by a 300-member business delegation, in a bid to boost economic ties. 
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik denied the agreement violates BiH's Constitution, as some Bosniak officials have claimed.

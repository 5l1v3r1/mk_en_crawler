NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot authorities have denied Greek Cypriots permission to enter the Turkish part of the island in order to attend a traditional Orthodox liturgy, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said on Saturday (August 30th). 
The rejection prevents a celebration of the liturgy at the Orthodox church of Saint Mamas in the town of Morphou, where a traditional pilgrimage every year celebrates Saint Mamas's Day on September 2nd. 
Christofias said the decision by the Turkish Cypriots "is not the best omen", just a few days before the start of direct reunification talks between him and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, on Wednesday.

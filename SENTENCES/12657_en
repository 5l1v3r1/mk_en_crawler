BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) outgoing Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic confirmed on Friday (4 February) that police had contacted the family of wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, seeking his surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
According to Matijasevic, contacts were regular and aimed at gaining information about Karadzic's whereabouts. 
The minister added that the talks were part of the Bosnian Serb entity's efforts to implement its obligations towards the war crimes tribunal and said such efforts would continue. 
Separately, Karadzic's wife, Liljana, said Friday that in December, RS authorities offered her family over 25,000 euros in aid as well as legal assistance, should Karadzic surrender. 
She insists neither she nor her children are in touch with the fugitive.
In other news, more than 1,000 people gathered in downtown Sarajevo on Saturday to remember the victims of a mortar attack on the city's open market 11 years ago. 
In all, 68 people were killed and 142 wounded when a mortar shell fired from nearby Serb positions exploded in the crowd.

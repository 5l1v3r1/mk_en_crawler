DJAKOVO, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Sunday (6 July) that he supports the idea of holding parliamentary elections during the second half of November. 
A number of issues should be settled by then, paving the way for Croatia's integration into the EU, Racan said during a visit to Djakovo.Asked about press reports suggesting increased tension within the country's ruling coalition, Racan acknowledged some disputes, but added that the current government would continue to be a "promising option" for Croatia.

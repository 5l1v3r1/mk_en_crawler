BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu held talks on Tuesday (March 20th) with leaders of the parties in parliament, in a bid to end the ongoing political turmoil and jumpstart reforms. 
At the last minute, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu declined to participate and no compromises were reached. 
Basescu held a similar round of consultations two weeks ago, hoping to convince party leaders to support the introduction of a majority voting system for next year's legislative elections.
In other news Tuesday, Parliament's legal committee approved proposed changes to the law on referendums. 
Under the amendment, in any referendum to impeach Basescu, the support of 50% plus one of the voters would be required. 
The lower chamber begins debating the amendment Wednesday.
The Senate meanwhile, rejected a no confidence motion filed against Education Minister Mihail Hardau. 
The opposition accuses him of leading the education sector into bankruptcy.

LUXEMBOURG -- EU foreign ministers said Monday (26 April) that the Union will offer a significant aid package to Turkish Cypriots, consisting of the 259m euros that had been set aside for northern Cyprus if the reunification bid succeeded in Saturday's referenda. 
The European Commission meanwhile announced that it would work with the Turkish Cypriots, but is not formally recognising their state.
In other news, Secretary General Kofi Annan told CNN on Monday that the UN is "done for now" with efforts to reunify Cyprus. 
Annan expressed disappointment with the failure of his blueprint, which was rejected by Greek Cypriots.

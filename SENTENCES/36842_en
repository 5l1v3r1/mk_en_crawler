BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting on Monday (12 July), EU foreign ministers officially authorised the deployment of a 7,000-strong force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that would take over from NATO by the end of the year. 
The EU mission, under British command, would be more extensive than those now under way in Macedonia and Congo, though the length of its mandate is still not clear. 
NATO welcomed the move during its summit two weeks ago in Istanbul.
The foreign ministers also reiterated a warning Monday to Republika Srpska (RS), urging it to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
They expressed support for High Representative Paddy Ashdown's recent actions penalising RS's lack of co-operation and stressed that BiH's bid for EU integration depends on apprehending indictees.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Eurozone finance ministers agreed on a 30 billion euro aid package to Greece on Sunday (April 11th), but stressed that Athens has not sought activation yet.
At a press conference in Brussels after a video conference involving the ministers, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn and Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker announced the green light for the plan.
Rehn said the three-year eurozone loans would carry an interest rate of around 5%, well below current market rates of about 7.3%.
Greece wants to be able to borrow at rates closer to its peers in the eurozone.
"With today's decision, Europe sends a very clear message that no one, any longer, can play with our common currency;
no one can play with our common fate," Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said, commenting on the decision.
Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou also welcomed the move.
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that the Fund is ready to contribute financing, "including through a multi-year stand-by arrangement".
An IMF team will discuss the issue Monday with Greek officials in Brussels.

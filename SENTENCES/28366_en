SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian companies are being denied the right to participate in revenue-raising carbon emissions trading, Environment Minister Nona Karadzhova announced on Thursday (May 13th). 
She blames a lack of appropriate action by the previous government and its disregard for specific recommendations made to Bulgaria. 
As a result, companies with the right to trade their carbon emissions can do so only until the end of June. 
This does not affect the government's quotas, Deputy Environment Minister Evdokia Maneva noted. 
Carbon emissions trading was included in the cabinet's anti-crisis package and was expected to raise 250m euros in revenue.

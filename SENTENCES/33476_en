OHRID, Macedonia -- Albanian Defence Minister Pandeli Majko and his Serbia-Montenegro counterpart, Boris Tadic, agreed Friday (26 September) that a military solution for the region is no longer acceptable. 
At a meeting of Adriatic Charter signatories in Ohrid, they agreed that a solution for Kosovo should be sought through dialogue. 
Tadic said Serbia-Montenegro and Albania must share the responsibility of ensuring security in the province and the region as a whole. 
The purpose of the bilateral talks was to ease tensions stemming from a recent exchange of statements on Kosovo that had put the countries at odds.

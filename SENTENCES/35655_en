BUCHAREST, Romania -- Finance Minister Mihai Tanasescu said on Saturday (5 June) that the closing of Chapter 29 in EU accession negotiations is an extremely important step forward.
Chapter 29 concerns Financial and Budgetary Provisions;
its closure last week settles procedures and availability of funds for strengthening institutional, structural and cohesion capabilities.
The EU financing made available following the closure of the negotiations is expected to create nearly 1 million new jobs from 2007-2013.

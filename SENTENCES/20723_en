PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Acknowledging Montenegro's integration efforts, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told officials on Friday (March 7th) that further progress depends on the pace of reforms. 
During a joint press conference in Podgorica with Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, Rehn encouraged the country to strengthen efforts against corruption and organised crime, to boost its administrative capacity and to work harder to reach consensus on domestic political issues. 
He also said Brussels appreciates Montenegro's responsible approach to the Kosovo issue.
Djukanovic, meanwhile, reiterated that full Euro-Atlantic integration remains a strategic priority for Montenegro.

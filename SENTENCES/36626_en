ROME, Italy -- Police say they have discovered a criminal group that brought pregnant Bulgarian women to give birth in Italy and then sold the children.
Adoptive parents were charged between 5,000 and 7,000 euros for the infants.
Authorities say the women were held in a Roma camp until they went into labour.
They were then taken to the Melzo hospital in Milan.
After giving birth the Bulgarian mothers refused to claim the children as their own.
Then the buyers stepped in to claim that they were the natural fathers and registered the children with the local authorities.
Three Bulgarians and three Italians have been arrested.

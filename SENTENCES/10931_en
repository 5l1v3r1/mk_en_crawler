BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Voters head back to the polls Sunday (3 October) for run-offs in about 145 cities, where the first round of voting on 19 September was inconclusive. 
Campaigning for these local elections officially ended Thursday night.
Meanwhile, Belgrade-based B92 is reporting that former Deputy Serbian Prime Minister Momcilo Perisic will be indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal. 
But tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann denied the report, saying no new indictments are planned.

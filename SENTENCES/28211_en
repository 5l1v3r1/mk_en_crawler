ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry announced on Wednesday (July 14th) it has complained to Ankara about a Turkish naval research ship that has been spotted between the islands of Rhodes and Kastelorizo.
The area where the "Piri Reis" was surveying is not in Greek territorial waters, but Athens has claimed rights to potential undersea mineral and fossil fuel deposits there.
According to the ministry, the ship challenged Greece's "sovereign rights".
Turkish authorities say it was conducting seismic research activities for humanitarian purposes.

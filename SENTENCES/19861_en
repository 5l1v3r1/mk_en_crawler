TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Party (SP) warned on Tuesday (October 23rd) that its members may withdraw from efforts to reform the judicial system, saying principles agreed on at the beginning of the process are being ignored.
SP official in parliament Erion Brace said the ruling Democratic Party's actual goal is not to reform the judiciary, but to turn the fight against corruption into a fight against the opposition.

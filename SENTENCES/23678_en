ANKARA, Turkey -- An avalanche killed 11 climbers and injured one on Zigana Mountain in Turkey's Black Sea province of Gumushane on Sunday (January 25th). 
Rescuers found six survivors and took one to hospital for treatment. 
Officials called off the search for other survivors by late afternoon Sunday, as there was a threat of another avalanche, said Gumushane Governor Enver Salihoglu. 
About 50 rescuers, including military personnel, took part in the search. 
The hikers were part of a group of between 15 and 20 people who were climbing at a height of 2,200m when snow crashed down on them, local media reported. 
They were members of a mountaineering club from the nearby province of Trabzon taking part in a weekend snow festival on Zigana Mountain.

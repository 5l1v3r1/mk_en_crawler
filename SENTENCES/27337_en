THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serbia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal has improved, but the country must work to achieve more positive results, Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz concludes in his latest report to the UN Security Council.
Parts of the report leaked to Serbian and international media on Monday (November 30th).
Brammertz is to present his report to the Security Council on Thursday.
According to the leaks, Brammertz will say that UN prosecutors are largely satisfied with current efforts Serbia is making to prove its co-operation, though the most critical issue remains finding and arresting war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
This evaluation of Serbia's co-operation is crucial to the country's EU integration bid.

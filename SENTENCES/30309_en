ATHENS, Greece -- The government said on Sunday (May 15th) that the arrest of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn won't affect its efforts to come out of financial crisis.
"We have a specific programme that the IMF is also involved in, and we are continuing to implement that programme.
As such, it is not an issue of individual personalities, it is an issue of institutional agreements" government spokesperson George Petalotis said.
Strauss-Kahn was charged in New York on Sunday with attempted rape, a criminal sexual act and unlawful imprisonment.
He allegedly forced a woman working in a hotel onto his bed Saturday and assaulted her.
He was apprehended aboard an Air France plane about to depart New York for Paris.
Strauss-Kahn was due to participate in a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels Monday and Tuesday to discuss possible additional aid to Greece.

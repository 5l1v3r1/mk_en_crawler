SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A joint session of BiH parliamentarians and the Office of the High Representative's Bulldozer Committee was held in Sarajevo on Tuesday (25 March).
The session focused on 50 recommendations for legal changes, aimed at reducing bureaucracy and stepping up economic reform.
Participants agreed that there was no other task more important than implementation of the reforms.
Also Tuesday, an expert team from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) presented the results of a study on possible risks of depleted uranium (DU) in BiH.
The report confirmed for the first time that DU from weapons used in BiH in 1994 and 1995 had contaminated local supplies of drinking water at one site, and can still be found in dust particles suspended in the air.
Though the contamination does not pose immediate radioactive or toxic risks, UNEP urged BiH authorities to regularly monitor ground and drinking water around such sites.

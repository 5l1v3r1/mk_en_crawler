NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos said in a televised interview Tuesday night (September 11th) that efforts to find a just solution to the Cyprus issue within the UN framework would continue.
He called for unity among the people of Cyprus and said it was the Turkish military, which invaded in 1974, that is to blame for the long-standing crisis.
"There are no enemies among us," Papadopoulos said.
"The enemy is one:
the Turkish occupation army.
The opponents in the political arena and in elections are only political opponents with different positions and are not enemies."
Turkey's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the Cypriot leader does not understand relations between the two countries.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Levent Bilman said the presence of Turkish forces on the island is based on international agreements, under which Great Britain, Greece and Turkey are to guarantee the stability of Cyprus.
"Describing the Turkish armed forces as an enemy does not contribute to peace," Bilman said.

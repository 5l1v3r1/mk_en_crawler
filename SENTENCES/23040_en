ATHENS, Greece -- A brutal murder stunned the island of Santorini on Sunday (August 3rd). 
Police say a 31-year-old man beheaded his girlfriend and carried her head around the heavily touristed island before they arrested him. 
The man, who police said had psychological problems, allegedly stabbed a policeman who tried to detain him, stole a police car and crashed into a motorcycle, injuring two women, before police caught him. 
Earlier this week, Tourism Minister Aris Spiliotopoulos vowed to make Greek resorts safer after a series of violent incidents at the peak of the tourist season.

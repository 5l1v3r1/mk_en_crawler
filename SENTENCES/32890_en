THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal issued a series of rulings Friday (29 November).
In perhaps the highest profile case, it rejected the Croatian government's appeal of the indictment of former Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko.
He is charged with leading an operation in the so-called Medak Pocket where as many as 100 Serbs were killed, their homes destroyed.
Zagreb has refused to arrest the 83-year-old retired general, insisting he was liberating part of his country and had not engaged in ethnic cleansing.
Thursday, a local court in Zagreb refused to extradite Bobetko, citing health reasons.
The opposition party Croatian Democratic Union reacted fiercely to Friday's tribunal ruling, insisting that Prime Minister Ivica Racan hold his ground or resign.
In a separate case, The Hague tribunal on Friday sentenced Bosnian Serb Mitar Vasiljevic to 20 years in prison on charges of crimes against humanity.
He was convicted of executing five Muslims in 1992, but acquitted of a burning alive 135 others in the town of Visegrad later that year.
Also, Macedonian Justice Minister Ismail Darlista submitted to the tribunal five cases of war crimes allegedly committed during last year's security crisis.
This is in accordance with the Resolution 827, which requires all states to co-operate with the tribunal.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During the first day of his visit Sunday (22 June), Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski described economic ties with Bulgaria as unsatisfactory.
He added, however, that relations between the two countries remained sincere and friendly, despite isolated cases -- a reference to recent incidents involving the mistreatment of two Bulgarian citizens in Skopje.
In other news, a delegation led by Bulgarian Economy Minister Nikolay Vassilev is in Portugal seeking to bolster business opportunities, especially golf tourism in Bulgaria.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev announced a limited cabinet reshuffle on Friday (July 13th), after meeting with members of the ruling tripartite coalition.
Peter Dimitrov, the chairman of the National Assembly's Budget Commission, is to replace Rumen Ovcharov as economy and energy minister.
Ovcharov resigned last month amid a corruption scandal.
Miglena Tacheva will become justice minister, taking over from Georgi Petkanov.
He recently stepped down after six years at the post, citing health issues.
Parliament is expected to approve the changes Wednesday.
Several deputy ministers resigned in the last 30 days and will be replaced after the vote in the Assembly.

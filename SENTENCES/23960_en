PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local institutions have until Sunday (December 21st) to appoint the commander of the Kosovo Security Forces (KSF), local media reported on Thursday, adding NATO South Wing Commander Mark Fitzgerald set the deadline.
"We are ready;
we are waiting only for Kosovo's government," an anonymous NATO source was quoted as saying.
Fitzgerald reportedly conveyed this message to President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci during a meeting at KFOR's headquarters in Pristina last week.
The KSF is assuming the duties of the current Kosovo Protection Corps.
In other news, Portuguese Defence Minister Nuno Severiano Teixeira visited Pristina on Thursday and said his country plans to maintain its current troop levels in Kosovo.
He added, "Portugal is also engaged in EULEX, and we do hope that the EULEX will be deployed in the entire territory of Kosovo." (Koha Ditore, Zeri, Express, Telegrafi, Kohavision - 19/12/08;

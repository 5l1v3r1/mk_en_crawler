SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has decided to immediately evacuate its diplomatic staff from Iraq.
The foreign ministry announced Thursday (6 March) it would start moving staff to neighbouring countries, in view of Bulgaria's position on Iraq and its expressed readiness to back possible military operations.
Also Thursday, Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov announced stepped up security measures at the Sarafovo base on the Black Sea, which the government has authorised US military forces to use in possible attacks against Iraq.

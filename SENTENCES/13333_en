PARIS, France -- President Jacques Chirac called on Friday (26 August) for EU discussions focused on Turkey's membership bid, particularly regarding Turkey's refusal to recognise the Greek Cypriot state. 
According to his spokesman, Chirac suggests that Turkey's stance on Cyprus is not in line with expectations of a candidate country.
Separately Friday, German opposition leader Angela Merkel echoed Chirac's concerns. 
The Christian Democrat is considered the main opponent to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in the ongoing German pre-election race. 
In a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and other EU leaders, Merkel suggested Turkey might instead be offered a "privileged partnership" with the EU.

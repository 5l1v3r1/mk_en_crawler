SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency adopted a package of draft constitutional amendments on Saturday (25 March) and forwarded them to the state parliament, announced Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic. 
He said that within an eight-day term the tripartite body would meet with representatives of the seven parties that signed the constitutional reform accords, in order to determine further steps towards their adoption. 
According to Tihic, the presidency expects the draft legislation to pass in parliament and be implemented before the next general elections in October.
In other news, Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic says his Serb Democratic Party (SDS) may be unable to register for the next BiH general elections due to lack of funds. 
In an interview published Saturday by the daily Nezavisne novine, Cavic said the blocking of SDS accounts at Privredna Banka Srpsko Sarajevo (PBSS) has put the party in a difficult financial situation. 
SDS owes more than 950,000 euros to the bank. 
Acting on a request by PBSS interim administrator Toby Robinson, the Eastern Sarajevo regional court froze the accounts in February.

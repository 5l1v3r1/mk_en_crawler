ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Supreme Court on Monday (19 January) ordered a retrial in the case of a Serb woman, overturning her 13-year sentence.
Zorana Banic, a 52-year-old nurse, was found guilty by a court in Zadar of participating in the November 1991 massacre of 34 Croatian civilians in Skabrnje, a nearby village.
Her lawyers argued that prosecutors had not proved she actually killed anyone.
Banic insists she was not in the area at the time.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) decided on Thursday (February 18th) to hold a third round of local elections in the Gjilan municipality.
The Supreme Court had supported another round in the eastern municipality after irregularities were found in the run-off.
CEC chairwoman Nesrin Lushta says the elections will be held on March 14th.
Democratic Party (PDK) officials oppose the decision, claiming it is the result of political pressure.
PDK candidate Xhemajl Mustafa will square off against Fatmir Rexhepi of the Democratic League of Kosovo.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Students at the Zagreb Faculty of Philosophy decided on Monday (November 23rd) to continue their protest because the government has not met their demands for free education. 
The students decided to boycott all lectures as they did in the spring. 
Back then, about 20 faculties in all major cities were blocked. 
On Monday, students in Pula and Rijeka joined the protest. 
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor says her government will do its best to guarantee free education for all students who meet the criteria.

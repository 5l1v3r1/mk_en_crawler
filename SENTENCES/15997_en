BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders on Friday (16 June) issued a stern warning to Turkey to open its seaports and airports to Greek Cypriot vessels and aircraft. 
Turkey made this commitment a year ago when it launched accession talks with the Union. 
French President Jacques Chirac said Ankara's continued refusal to meet its obligations would put into doubt its capacity to further pursue membership in the EU. 
European Commission President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso said the issue posed a major challenge to Turkey's accession process. 
"If the negotiations halt, then let them halt," a defiant Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded. 
"We will never take a step backwards, not in the ports or the airports, without the isolation being lifted" from the Turkish republic on the island, Erdogan told the Istanbul Chamber of Industry.

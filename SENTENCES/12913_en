BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The heads of NATO and the European Commission urged Croatia on Tuesday (1 March) to arrest General Ante Gotovina and transfer him to the UN tribunal. 
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told President Stipe Mesic that the fugitive must be brought to justice. 
EU Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso echoed this statement, saying the general must be extradited to The Hague if Zagreb wants to launch accession talks this month, as scheduled. 
Mesic told both leaders that his government does not know Gotovina's whereabouts. 
In Zagreb, Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks said a delay in launching EU talks would have political repercussions.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said in an interview published Saturday (October 21st) that the government of Vojislav Kostunica was "directly responsible" for failing to arrest war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic.
He pledged that his Democratic Party would task other people with finding Mladic if it wins the upcoming elections in Serbia.
The vote could take place as early as mid-December.
Meanwhile, UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the French newspaper Liberation that Mladic is still in Serbia, and is mostly in and around Belgrade.
She said the action plan of the Serbian government for locating and arresting Mladic is not working, and voiced hope that it would become effective soon.

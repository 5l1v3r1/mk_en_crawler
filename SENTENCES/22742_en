SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev dismissed Ivan Drashkov, deputy director of the National Security Agency (NSA) on Thursday (October 9th).
Drashkov was involved in a recent scandal over allegations that the agency was illegally monitoring journalists.
Last week, Eliana Maseva, a member of parliament's committee for internal control, said the NSA has investigated a wide range of journalists in order to stop information leaks from the agency.
In September, a similar scandal erupted over claims that the agency was illegally tapping the personal phones of several lawmakers and businessmen for political purposes.

TIRANA, Albania -- The deputy chairman of the opposition Democratic Party (DP), Bamir Topi, said Friday (14 May) the party is willing to co-operate with the ruling Socialists. 
He added that DP deputies would work with colleagues in the parliamentary commissions on issues such as restitution and compensation for property confiscation. 
Last week, DP boycotted parliamentary sessions after the bill on compensating victims of political persecution was excluded from the agenda. 
International institutions have criticised the lack of political consensus in Albania, describing it as a major obstacle to Euro-Atlantic integration.
In other news Friday, a European Commission delegation and Tirana University signed a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of a Centre for EU Information and Documentation in Tirana. 
It will organise workshops and conferences, and conduct training courses on EU issues.

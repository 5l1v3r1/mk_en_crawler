SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Fragmentation in Bulgaria's right-wing political spectrum is seriously reducing voters' confidence in the right-wing parties, according to poll results published Saturday (13 March).
The poll, conducted by Sova Harris, indicates the left-wing Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) stands a better chance of winning the next parliamentary elections.
BSP leads with 21.7 per cent of the vote, followed by the right-wing opposition United Democratic Forces with 7.8 per cent.
In other news, parliament on Friday approved amendments to the money laundering law that are designed to bring the penal code closer to EU standards.
They envision a punishment of up to two years or a fine of 5,000 to 10,000 leva.

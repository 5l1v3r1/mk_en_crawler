SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The new coalition cabinet holds its first session Thursday (18 August), focusing on measures to overcome recent devastating floods.
Parliament approved the cabinet earlier this week after weeks of wrangling and coalition building.
In other news, the rightist Democrats for Strong Bulgaria announced on Wednesday it would nominate former Central Bank Governor Svetoslav Gavriyski for mayor of Sofia.
The election will be held in late October.
The post was held by Stefan Sofianski, who won a seat in the new parliament.

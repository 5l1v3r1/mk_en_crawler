SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried was in Skopje on Friday (March 7th) to discuss differences between Macedonia and Greece in their longstanding name dispute, and the effect on Skopje's NATO bid. 
Fried met with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and Macedonia's representative in the name talks, Nikola Dimitrov, after a separate meeting with President Branko Crvenkovski. 
Fried later said he has urged both Skopje and Athens to work together with UN envoy Matthew Nimetz to reach a mutually acceptable solution. 
Greece has threatened to derail Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic bids unless it changes its name.

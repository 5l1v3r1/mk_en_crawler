SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN Security Council on Thursday (November 20th) unanimously decided to extend by another year the mandate of the EU peacekeeping mission in BiH, EUFOR. 
Thirteen years after fighting ended, the Security Council reminded the Muslims, Serbs and Croats in BiH that the main responsibility for the Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the conflict, belongs to them.

MOSCOW, Russia -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev is making an urgent visit to Moscow on Wednesday (January 14th) to discuss natural gas deliveries with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, after Russia resumed supplies to Europe but Ukraine failed to open the pipelines. 
The Bulgarian delegation also includes Minister of Economy and Energy Petar Dimitrov, as well as a team of experts who will monitor the transit of Russian natural gas across Ukrainian territory in line with the EU-mediated agreement signed by Russia and Ukraine.
In other news, protestors plan to rally in front of the parliament building in Sofia on Wednesday. 
It will be a diverse group: students, mothers of large families, teachers, environmentalists, football fans, farmers and others, all organised by a group of NGOs. 
They have announced a total of 19 demands, including payment of all funding that was due in 2008, a strategy for higher education and scientific research, the transformation of so-called college towns into university campuses and an end to corrupt practises.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The latest wave of detentions as part of the controversial Ergenekon investigation sparked angry reactions from Turkey's opposition parties Tuesday (April 14th).
Addressing their parties' parliamentary group meetings, both Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahceli criticised the course of the ongoing investigation.
"The Ergenekon probe ...
is a case that is motivated by politicians and has political targets," said Baykal.
The MHP's Bahceli echoed that sentiment.
"There are widespread concerns that the laws are being abused for political gain and used to oppress people," he said.
On Monday, police arrested more than 40 people, including academics and journalists, for suspected involvement in the shadowy secularist Ergenekon group, which allegedly plotted to overthrow the ruling Justice and Development Party's government.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Tens of thousands of people, including foreign dignitaries and international officials, gathered in Potocari on Monday (11 July) to mark the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.
The remains of 610 recently identified victims were laid to rest in a local memorial cemetery during the ceremony.
Authorities in Sarajevo asked the public to observe a moment of silence for the victims at noon.
On Sunday, British General David Leakey, who commands the EU peacekeepers in BiH, said the net was closing around those responsible for the death of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica.
He explained that authorities have accelerated their search for information about the supporters and whereabouts of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.

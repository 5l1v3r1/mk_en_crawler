BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- In a statement released Wednesday (18 December), the UN Security Council called on Yugoslav authorities to step up co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
In particular, the Council called for the government to assist in the arrest and transfer of war crimes indictees, 11 of whom remain at large. 
Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic insists that police are ready to arrest any indictee, including former army commander Ratko Mladic. 
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic meanwhile noted that incumbent Serbian President Milan Milutinovic would have to report to the UN tribunal after he steps down in January.
Meanwhile, Djindjic said Wednesday that a draft text of the new Serbian Constitution might move to parliament around the middle of next year. 
He says that the government and parliament should begin preparing the document after the constitutional charter of the new Yugoslav federation is adopted. 
Djindjic rival Vojislav Kostunica said recently that his Democratic Party of Serbia would support Djindjic's government only if talks on drafting a new Serbian Constitution begin at once.

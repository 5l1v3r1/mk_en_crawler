PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu on Thursday (September 4th) said UNMIK cannot be a mediator in any potential meeting between him and Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic. 
"We consider UNMIK as facilitator in the process of closing down its mission," Sejdiu said. 
He stressed he is ready to meet Tadic only if the talks are cast as a meeting between the presidents of two independent countries. 
He ruled out discussion of issues related to Kosovo's status.
In other news Thursday, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his country will not support Serbia's initiative to seek the International Court of Justice's opinion of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia in February. 
"We have already recognised an independent Kosovo. 
We would not have done that had we believed the decision ran counter to international law," Steinmeier told journalists after meeting with his Serbian counterpart, Vuk Jeremic. 
"The moment has come for Serbia to look forward to the future, not backward," Steinmeier stressed.

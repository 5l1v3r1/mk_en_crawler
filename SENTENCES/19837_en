BELGRADE, Serbia -- Twenty-five members of a Belgrade criminal gang, known as the Zemun Clan, were sentenced to more than 465 years in prison on Friday (January 18th) in one of the biggest trials in Serbia's history. 
The gang was held responsible for a series of murders, assassinations and terrorist attacks during the collapse of Slobodan Milosevic's regime. 
They are also charged with organising the 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

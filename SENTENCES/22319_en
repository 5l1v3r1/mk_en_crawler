BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) will insist on the resignation of Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic due to her "whimsical decision to adjourn parliament", DSS whip Slobodan Vuksanovic said on Friday (August 8th).
He added the DSS would start talks with representatives of other opposition parties about removing Djukic-Dejanovic from the post and resuming parliamentary work.
Dejanovic, saying she wants to boost parliament's efficiency, has taken a number of controversial steps.
These include warnings to lawmakers, setting time limits for remarks, sending members back to their seats and expulsions.
The DSS describes the measures as a "dictatorship" that the opposition must unite to fight.
Two other opposition parties -- New Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party -- back the DSS on the matter.

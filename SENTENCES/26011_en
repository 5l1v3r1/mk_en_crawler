PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Republic of Malawi has become the 64th state to recognise Kosovo's independence, notifying foreign ministry officials in Pristina on Wednesday (December 16th).
Malawi's move came shortly after hearings ended at The Hague-based International Court of Justice, on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has rejected former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's request to remove one of the three judges hearing his case, media reported on Tuesday (May 19th). 
Karadzic had argued she is biased, due to her 1997-2003 stint as president of the Human Rights Chamber of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
The panel was established under the Dayton Accords to investigate human rights violations committed in BiH during the 1990s conflict. 
Karadzic claimed that during her presidency, Picard showed "unacceptable bias" and "advocated for the rights of Muslim victims". 
The tribunal, however, said there are no grounds for such claims.

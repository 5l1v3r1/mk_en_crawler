PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Police announced on Wednesday (February 24th) that Darko Saric, sought by Serbia for cocaine trafficking, left Montenegro several days before Belgrade delivered an arrest warrant to Interpol's office in Podgorica. 
Serbia issued the arrest warrant on January 21st. 
Saric is suspected of smuggling two tonnes of cocaine from South America. 
A parliamentary panel says co-ordination between relevant institutions in charge of Saric's case was substandard and urged the government to improve channels.

IZMIR, Turkey -- One man died and 14 others were injured in a bomb blast in Pornova, a town in the Izmir district, on Saturday (May 11th), according to media reports. 
For the time being, no further details are known and no group has claimed responsibility. 
The media noted that the explosion happened a day before a planned rally against the Islamization of Turkey.
In a separate story, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul confirmed on Friday that he would remain in the presidential race. 
The presidential nomination of Gul, a member of the ruling Justice and Development Party, was twice rejected by the legislature in recent weeks, due to an opposition boycott.

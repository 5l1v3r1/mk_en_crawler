ZAGREB, Croatia -- During a closed session Tuesday (April 27th), the government approved amendments to the constitution and forwarded them to parliament for passage.
Debate is to begin on Wednesday.
The amendments, approved by the parliamentary constitutional committee last week, involve issues related to minorities, fighting crime and completing Croatia's EU accession negotiations.
Changes related to the expatriate vote, something the ruling coalition and the opposition could not agree on during their negotiations, were left out.
Passage of any amendment requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority.

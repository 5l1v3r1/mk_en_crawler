ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis has invited the UN envoy for the name dispute with Skopje, Matthew Nimitz, to visit Athens for talks Friday (January 12th).
Greece is seeking the resumption of UN-mediated negotiations aimed at resolving its long-standing argument with Macedonia, whose constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia" Greece does not recognise for historical reasons.
Greece wants Nimitz's latest proposal to be the basis of renewed talks, though Skopje rejected it last year.
Last week, Athens criticised a move by the Macedonian government to rename the Skopje airport as "Aleksander Makedonski", in honour of Alexander the Great.

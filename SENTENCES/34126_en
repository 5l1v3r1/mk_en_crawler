ATHENS, Greece -- On Thursday (17 July), Foreign Minister George Papandreou condemned the requests made by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in a recent letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Papandreou described the requests as tactical games and dismissed them as non-essential.
Meeting on Thursday with his Italian counterpart, Franco Frattini, Papandreou said the momentum created by the decision to accept Cyprus as a member of the EU bolsters hopes for reunification of the island.
Frattini said his country, which assumes the rotating EU presidency this month, sees no reliable or serious alternative to the peace plan proposed by Annan.

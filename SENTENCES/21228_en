THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Culture Minister Astrit Haracia and his co-worker and former editor-in-chief of the newspaper BotaSot, Bajrush Morina, pleaded not guilty to charges of contempt of court in their first appearance before the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague on Tuesday (April 29th). 
The two allegedly tried to intimidate a protected witness into withholding testimony from the trial of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
In early April, the tribunal acquitted Haradinaj of all charges.
In other news Tuesday, the war crimes chamber of the BiH Court sentenced two Bosnian Serbs to 17 years in prison each. 
It found Mirko Todorovic and Milos Radic guilty of killing eight of 14 Muslims who had been hiding in a quarry in eastern Bosnia in May 1992.
Separately, the court sentenced Pasko Ljubicic, a Bosnian Croat military police commander, to ten years in prison for obeying an order to attack the village of Ahmici in April 1993. 
More than 100 Muslim civilians were killed there.

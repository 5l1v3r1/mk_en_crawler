VIENNA, Austria -- The next round of talks to determine Kosovo's future status is scheduled to begin Monday (7 August) in Vienna.
Serbia had requested a postponement for one week, but the state news agency said Friday that Belgrade has agreed to go ahead as scheduled.
Meanwhile, diplomats from the "Contact Group" -- Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia and the United States -- expressed concern about the situtation in northern Kosovo.
Both Belgrade and Pristina "should take immediate steps to reduce tensions in northern Kosovo, particularly to encourage responsible leadership and build confidence among communities," the group said in a statement.
KFOR and UNMIK have increased their presence in the area, amid fears of hostility erupting between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs.
On Saturday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica urged action from the international community, following reports of an ethnically motivated knife attack on a Serb teen in the Kosovo village of Priluzje.
He was treated at hospital and released.

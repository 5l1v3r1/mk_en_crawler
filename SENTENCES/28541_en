BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament is set to discuss a declaration Thursday (October 14th) condemning war crimes committed against Serbs during the conflicts of the 1990s.
The motion was submitted by 123 lawmakers from the ruling parties.
It condemns crimes against Serbs during the wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo and calls on the parliaments of other countries, especially former Yugoslav republics, to condemn all crimes committed against Serbs as well.
The document also urges relevant international organisations and institutions to punish those responsible for such crimes.
In late March, parliament passed a landmark declaration condemning the July 1995 atrocities Bosnian Serb army and paramilitaries committed against Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica.

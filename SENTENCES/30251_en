ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has summoned Israeli Ambassador Gaby Levi to express dissatisfaction with a sea border demarcation deal between Israel and Cyprus, local media reported on Sunday (December 19th).
According to reports, the meeting between Gaby and Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu was held at the ministry Thursday, a day before Cyprus and Israel signed the agreement that will allow them to press ahead in their search for energy sources in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
Sinirlioglu reportedly warned Levy that the deal would have a negative effect on long-standing efforts to settle the Cypriot issue.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu on Thursday (19 May) honoured nine US servicemen who died in a plane crash in Albania on 31 March. 
Awarding them posthumously with the Medal of Gratitude, he cited their "sublime act of giving their lives in service of the military co-operation between Albania and the United States." The C-130 transport plane carrying the nine young men crashed in the mountains of southern Albania during a joint night exercise.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police on Wednesday (February 10th) arrested 13 members of an organised crime ring as part of a large-scale operation code-named Octopus. 
Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said the group -- believed active for more than ten years -- participated in money laundering, blackmail, bribery, drug trafficking, and tax fraud. 
Investigators say it may have been protected by high-ranking judicial and former government officials. 
Alexei Petrov, a former adviser to the State National Security Agency, was among those arrested.

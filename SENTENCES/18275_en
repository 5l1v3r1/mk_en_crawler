TIRANA, Albania -- The defence ministers of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- Fatmir Mediu, Berislav Roncevic and Lazar Elenovski -- met in Tirana on Tuesday (December 12th) to further co-ordinate efforts for NATO integration in light of last month's Riga summit. 
The ministers adopted a joint declaration describing the message from NATO as a great encouragement that would give the countries new impetus for army reforms. 
The declaration also emphasised the importance of regional co-operation, security, defence reforms and the fight against corruption and organised crime in order to achieve full-fledged NATO membership. 
In his speech, Albanian President Alfred Moisiu said Adriatic Charter co-operation has proved a successful formula, in terms of joint military exercises and exchanges of expertise.

ATHENS, Greece -- President Karolos Papoulias met on Wednesday (November 26th) with visiting Cypriot counterpart Demetris Christofias and said neither Greece nor Cyprus is happy with Turkey's activities in the Mediterranean Sea. 
Ankara and Nicosia have been exchanging allegations and lodging protests over recent oil exploration activities off the Cypriot coast, in the country's exclusive economic zone. 
On Wednesday, Papoulias supported Cyprus' position, saying Turkish attempts to undermine the sovereign rights of a country to use its maritime resources are unacceptable. 
Christofias said Cyprus is watching Turkey's behaviour carefully.

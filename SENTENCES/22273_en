SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), the Liberal Democratic Party, the New Social Democratic Party and the New Alternative party, all members of the Sun coalition, walked out of parliament Thursday (July 17th) over the arrest of Strumica Mayor and SDSM Vice President Zoran Zaev. 
He faces charges of abuse of office related to illegal activities in the construction of a marketplace in Strumica. 
SDSM leader Radmila Sekerinska said the arrest was a political move by the interior ministry to disguise a newly formed coalition between the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration. 
"This is a violation of the legal system aimed at eliminating the opposition," Sekerinska said. 
Zaev obtained his release late Sunday after 12 hours of questioning.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The draft development strategy of BiH and implementation of economic reforms were the main issues discussed at a session of the Co-ordination Body for Economic Development and EU Integration in Sarajevo on Monday (12 May).
BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said the talks focused on measures to boost exports and harmonise oil taxation procedures across BiH.
In other news, Terzic met Monday with the World Bank's new country director for BiH, Orsalia Kalantzopoulos.
She urged the country to accelerate economic reforms in order to retain the interest of international donors, which she said is already shifting to other areas emerging from conflict.

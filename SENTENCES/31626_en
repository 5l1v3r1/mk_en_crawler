TIRANA, Albania -- Industry Minister Viktor Doda and Kosovo Economy Minister Ali Jakupi met Friday (11 April) about the reconstruction of the Tirana-Pristina power transmission line. 
Aides say the ministers also discussed bilateral co-operation, especially in the energy sector. 
Electricity generation in Albania is based mainly on waterpower, while Kosovo relies on thermal power plants. 
Thus the two countries could cover each other's deficits in periods of reduced production.

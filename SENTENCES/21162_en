PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serb police officers in Kosovo walked off the job Friday (February 29th) demanding to remain under UNMIK command instead of the Kosovo Police Service (KPS). 
The Serb policemen have refused to work for the new state of Kosovo, which they do not recognise. 
A total of 126 police officers from Serb enclaves in central Kosovo have joined colleagues from eastern and northern Kosovo.
"We want to work and our work to be regulated in accordance with Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council," the commander of the police station in Gracanica, Stojan Milosevic, said on Friday. 
He denied that the Serb police officers within the KPS were acting on commands coming from Belgrade.

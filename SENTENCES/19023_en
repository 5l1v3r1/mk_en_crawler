TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and Edi Rama of the major opposition Socialist Party (SP), are expected to meet again in Tirana on Tuesday (July 3rd), ahead of the third and final round of presidential elections in parliament on Wednesday. 
Choosing a consensus candidate has proved impossible so far: Berisha backs DP official Bamir Topi, whom opposition leaders reject. 
On Monday, the chairmen of the five left-wing opposition parties decided to back a second term for outgoing President Alfred Moisiu. 
If the third round of voting fails on Wednesday, Albania could face early elections.

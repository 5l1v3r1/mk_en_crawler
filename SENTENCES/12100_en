BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic on Friday (14 January) urged the government in Belgrade to draw up a clear plan for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
A day after Washington's announcement that it was withholding $10m in aid, the president warned that the current non co-operation policy has plunged the country into international isolation.
US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt says Washington would withdraw its technical advisers from a number of Serbian ministries.
Efforts to help JAT Airways restore flights to the United States also would be halted.
In other news, a strike by JAT pilots kept planes grounded for a second day on Saturday.
The pilots are seeking back pay, but the government refuses to negotiate, deeming the strike illegal.

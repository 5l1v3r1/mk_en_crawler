LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The centre-right coalition narrowly won Sunday's (3 October) parliamentary elections.
The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and the conservative New Slovenia coalition took 38 per cent of the vote compared to the ruling centre-left coalition's 37 per cent, according to official results.
Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted defeat after it became clear that the SDS-led coalition would get 38 seats in the 90-seat house.
Turnout was about 60 per cent.
Talks on forming a ruling coalition were expected to begin Monday.

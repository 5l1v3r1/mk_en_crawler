SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Election Commission spokesperson Maksida Bajramovic said Wednesday (19 May) that the municipal elections scheduled for 2 October would take place despite the failure of some municipalities to pay their share for preparations. 
Bajramovic said several municipalities owe nearly 900,000 euros in unpaid contributions to the Election Commission. 
Parliament decided to make the central and entity governments provide the necessary funding by 25 July. 
In all, the Election Commission estimates around 1.7m euros are needed.

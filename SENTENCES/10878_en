ANKARA, Turkey -- Two former energy ministers appear in court Tuesday (2 November) to face charges of corruption and abuse of power. 
Cumhur Ersumer and Zeki Cakan are accused of rigging tenders -- particularly for the purchase of natural gas -- which may have cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars. 
They will be tried by the Constitutional Court, which in this case would sit as the Supreme Court. 
Its ruling would not be subject to appeal. 
The trial is expected to last several months and is seen as part of the ruling Justice and Development Party's drive to root out corruption.

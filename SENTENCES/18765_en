BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) police chief Uros Pena said on Monday (January 8th) that entity authorities have no information about the possible movement of war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin on RS territory. 
He added that the Interior Ministry is co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal, and that tribunal investigators in RS are satisfied with the work of entity police.
Also Monday, the BiH Court confirmed an indictment against a former Serb soldier, Jadranko Palija, for crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians. 
The charges stem from Serb forces' attacks on the Bosniak and Croat population in Krajina in the early 1990s.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Hundreds gathered in Tuzla on Tuesday (September 29th) to protest a Serbian court verdict sentencing Bosnian national Ilija Jurisic to 12 years in prison for war crimes. 
Jurisic was found guilty of ordering an attack against a former Yugoslav National Army convoy withdrawing from Tuzla in May 1992. 
At least 51 soldiers were killed and 50 were wounded in the attack. 
His lawyer has called the verdict "scandalous" and has vowed to appeal. 
Protestors, organised by several NGOs, said on Tuesday they want to demonstrate to authorities in Belgrade that the verdict is "a political game" that aimed to "make crimes seem relative".

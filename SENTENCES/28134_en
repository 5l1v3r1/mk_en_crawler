BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov met with EU Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Olli Rehn on Monday (June 21st) to discuss European Commission (EC) concerns over large changes to the country's budget targets. 
At one point, Rehn expressed doubts over the reliability of statistical data that Bulgaria provides to the EU's statistical body, Eurostat, and said a special audit mission would be sent to Sofia. 
But after the meeting, Dyankov said he explained to Rehn that the budget revision has not passed its second reading in parliament yet, which is why no official information has been provided, negating the need for any extraordinary audit mission. 
The two officials also discussed Bulgaria's 2009 budget. 
The EC initiated an excessive deficit procedure against the country when the deficiency ballooned from the initially announced 1.9% of GDP to 3.9% of GDP.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Sarajevo-based International Commission on Missing Persons said Tuesday (31 May) that it is conducting a new project aimed at locating and mapping mass graves in BiH. 
According to panel spokesman Doune Porter, the first stage of the project -- seeking new methods for location via satellite imagery, geology and forensic archaeology -- has just been completed. 
Porter said British and US experts were involved in this first phase and that the joint team used some already documented sites in the eastern BiH region of Zvornik for their research.
In other news, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic met with former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammed in Sarajevo Tuesday.

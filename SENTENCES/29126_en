ANKARA, Turkey -- Early Thursday (May 6th), parliament approved another article in the constitutional reform package proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
The article, which envisions restructuring the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors, was supported by 334 lawmakers in the 550-seat parliament. 
It required 330 votes for passage. 
Voting on several remaining articles will continue Thursday. 
The AKP has stepped up efforts to ensure that these others are approved, after one that would make party closures more difficult narrowly failed earlier this week.
On Wednesday, the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) reiterated plans to ask the Constitutional Court to annul the package. 
Just 13 signatures shy of the 110 it needs to begin the procedure, the CHP is looking to independents in parliament to put them over the top. 
The small opposition party, the Democratic Leftist Party, provided six signatures the CHP needed for the annulment application.

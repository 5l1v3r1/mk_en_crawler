SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a meeting Monday (October 8th) organised by Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic, the six Serb parties in the RS parliament agreed to recommend that the BiH Central Election Commission organise elections for entity president and two vice presidents, in the wake of President Milan Jelic's death late last month.
BiH election law stipulates that all three constituent peoples -- Bosniak, Croats and Serbs -- should nominate presidential candidates and that the one who gets the most votes should become president.
The RS parliament appointed Radojicic as interim president until new elections are held, probably in December.

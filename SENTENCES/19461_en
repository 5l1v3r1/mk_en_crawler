BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Foreign Ministry officially filed a protest Saturday (February 23rd) concerning a comment broadcast on Russian state television about former reformist Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Journalist Konstantin Semin, whose comments also appeared on YouTube, called Djindjic a "western marionetteâ¦ who sold the heroes of the Serbian national resistance to The Hague".
He went on to suggest that Djindjic, assassinated by a sniper in front of the Serbian government building in March 2003, deserved to be killed.

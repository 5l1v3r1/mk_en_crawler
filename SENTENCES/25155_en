THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic resumed on Tuesday (October 27th) at the UN war crimes tribunal, despite his continued boycott of the process.
Judge O-Gon Kwon noted that Karadzic had chosen not to appear in the courtroom and warned that the court would consider imposing a lawyer to represent him if he continues to boycott the trial.
A decision on that is expected next week.
In his opening statement, prosecutor Alain Tieger described Karadzic as the "undisputed leader" of Serbs responsible for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
"This case is about that supreme commander, a man who harnessed the forces of nationalism, hatred and fear to implement his vision of an ethnically separated Bosnia -- Radovan Karadzic," Tieger said.
He added that Bosnian Serb forces killed thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, imprisoned thousands more and forced hundreds of thousands to leave their homes in an ethnic cleansing drive.
According to Tieger, Karadzic was a "hands-on leader".
He faces 11 charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed from 1992-1995.

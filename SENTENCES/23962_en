BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) and the Social Democratic Party (PSD) announced on Thursday (December 18th) members of the future coalition government, headed by Emil Boc. 
Eleven of the current ministers will remain in the cabinet, and the two parties in the ruling coalition will equally divide 20 posts. 
Only the justice minister's seat is still vacant at this point. 
Two key cabinet members are PSD member Cristian Diaconescu (foreign minister) and Gheorghe Pogea (finance minister). 
All nominees are subject to parliament's approval. 
Given the two parties' majorities there, observers expect no problems with confirmation.

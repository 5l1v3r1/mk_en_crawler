SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Modernisation of the armed forces will be kicked into high gear early in the new year, according to an official year-end report presented Monday (16 December) by Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov and Chief of Staff Gen Nikola Kolev. 
While acknowledging more needs to be done, Svinarov said "the NATO membership invitation, which Bulgaria received in Prague, obviously came as a result of the accomplishments in military reform and the fulfilment of general political requirements."
In other news, IMF officials predicted Monday that despite some disagreements on the state budget, the IMF mission in Bulgaria will most probably support the government's fiscal programme. 
A second performance review of the current stand-by agreement is underway this week.

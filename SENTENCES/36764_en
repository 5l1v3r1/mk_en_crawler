WASHINGTON, United States -- During talks Wednesday (21 July) in Washington, Serbian President Boris Tadic and US Secretary of State Colin Powell discussed Belgrade's need to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, particularly by arresting and extraditing indictees, including General Ratko Mladic. 
Powell also conveyed Washington's readiness to assist Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration efforts. 
In addition, Tadic and Powell discussed developments in Kosovo. 
In a speech later to the National Press Club, Tadic called for regional co-operation and economic, political and judicial reform. 
He also appealed for more Western investment.
During a visit to Sarajevo meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic told reporters that the army is not protecting Mladic. 
But he did not rule out the possibility that retired officers are helping the former Bosnian Serb military commander evade justice.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak expressed concern Monday (July 30th) about the draft amendment to the immunity law that will be voted on in the state-level parliament on Tuesday. 
Lajcak opposes expanding immunity for MPs, a move that would free them from prosecution for crimes such as drunk driving, abuse of office and wartime atrocities. 
The present immunity law, which was enacted in 2002, finally made public office-holders accountable for their actions, Lajcak said, insisting on its preservation. 
He also reproached the main Croatian party, HDZ, for submitting the law in urgent procedure, thus trying to avoid public debate.
Also on Monday, the BiH Parliament adopted the Higher Education Law -- a key element of state education reform. 
It paves the way for recognition of BiH diplomas within the European Higher Education Area. 
Lajcak lauded the move, saying that BiH political leaders have demonstrated responsibility to the citizens. 
Lajcak said the move is "the best possible news for more than 100,000 students and staff of this country's higher education institutions".

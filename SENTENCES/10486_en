LONDON, United Kingdom -- Standard & Poor's has cut its ratings for Greece from "A" to "A-" due to concerns about public finances.
"The downgrade reflects the lack of a resolute strategy to achieve rapid and lasting improvements to the general government primary balance, and to initiate a significant and sustained decrease of the public debt ratio," S&P said in a statement Wednesday (17 November).
Also Wednesday, the government announced that the EU has decided to give Athens until 2006 to bring its budget deficit into line with the Union's mandatory ceiling of 3 per cent or less.
A spokesman said the government is determined to fix the problem in 2005.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In its first decision Tuesday (29 August) since taking office, the new government slashed the Value Added Tax (VAT) on agricultural raw materials from 18 per cent to 5 per cent.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the government also plans to introduce preferential tax rates on seeds, fertilizers and farm machinery.
His party, VMRO-DPMNE, had promised during the campaign to boost the competitiveness of the agriculture sector.
The US embassy in Skope issued a statement Tuesday hailing the peaceful transition of power.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal rejected an appeal for provisional release filed by former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski.
Judge Muhammad Shahabuddin thus confirmed an earlier ruling citing insufficient guarantees that Boskovski would actually return for trial when summoned.
He and former Macedonian security official Johan Tarculovski are awaiting trial for crimes allegedly committed against ethnic Albanians in Ljuboten, during the 2001 interethnic conflict.

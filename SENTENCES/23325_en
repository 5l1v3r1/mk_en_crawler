SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and Greek counterpart Dora Bakoyannis failed to meet on the sidelines of an OSCE ministerial conference on the Greek island of Corfu, local media reported Sunday (June 28th).
Bakoyannis's schedule was full, the Greek side explained.
Milososki expressed regret but reiterated his invitation for a meeting in Skopje.
He says Bakoyannis has accepted the invitation but has not specified a date.
"We are ready for dialogue and the visit could be a good opportunity for its resumption," Milososki added.
The meeting in Corfu could have been a chance for talks on the longstanding name dispute ahead of UN mediator Matthew Nimetz's visits to Macedonia and Greece in July.

WASHINGTON, United States -- A spokesman for the US State Department on Wednesday (15 October) praised the conduct of Albania's local elections last weekend and said they reflected the country's commitment to democracy.
Richard Boucher said in a statement that the vote was a key element of Tirana's progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration.
He welcomed an OSCE report that found no major incidents during the elections.
The OSCE had 230 international observers in Albania who concluded that, despite some shortcomings, the election process showed the country was closer to meeting Western criteria.

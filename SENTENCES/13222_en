ANKARA, Turkey -- Following two failed attempts earlier this year, the first-ever public debate about the early 20th century mass killings of Armenians was held in Turkey Saturday (24 September), with the backing of senior Turkish leaders who cited the participants' right to freedom of expression.
The conference, attended mostly by academics, took place at the Bilgi University in Istanbul under tight security as nationalists demonstrated outside, calling the event "traitorous".
Last week, a court had banned the event, prompting Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to say that the ruling was timed to undermine the country's efforts to join the EU.
"I want to live in a Turkey where freedoms are enjoyed in their broadest sense," Erdogan said Saturday.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul also defended the event, saying the ban showed that Turks "are so good at shooting themselves in the foot".
The EU condemned the court's move as a "provocation" and warned the conference would be considered a test of freedom of expression in Turkey, an EU hopeful.
As many as 1.5 million Armenians are thought to have been killed between 1915 and 1923, in what Armenia and several governments around the world have termed a genocide.
Turkey, however, denies the charge, arguing that the death toll is inflated and that Turks as well as Armenians perished in civil unrest and intercommunal fighting as the Ottoman Empire collapsed.

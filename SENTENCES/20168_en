PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo's negotiating team gathered on Wednesday (August 15th) to discuss preparations for the next meeting with the EU-US-Russia troika that is overseeing new negotiations on Kosovo's final status. 
At a press conference, spokesman Skender Hyseni expressed disappointment over the format of talks with the troika, including a trip to Vienna in two weeks. 
As for parliamentary and local elections in the province, the group agreed these should be held in the third week of November, though the debate is subject to change if the status negotiations warrant it.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu announced plans Monday (7 March) for a drastic reform of the ministry, in a bid to improve efficiency in line with the country's expected EU entry in 2007.
He also said he has asked all current diplomats to address the national council in charge of studying the archives of the communist-era Securitate.
He wants them to make their files public in order to "clear" the ministry of former communist security agents.

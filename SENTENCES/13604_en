ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities are testing 54 illegal immigrants, mostly from Bangladesh and Pakistan, for bird flu. 
Greek Coastguard personnel found the immigrants and their four Albanian guides in two rubber boats off the island of Samos, near the Turkish coast. 
There were three bodies in the dinghies. 
A spokeswoman for the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said on Saturday (21 January) that all initial tests for bird flu were negative.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Meeting with his US counterpart Colin Powell, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Wednesday (17 September) that while the interest of the international community may have turned to the Middle East, it should not neglect the Balkans, as it remains a difficult region.
Papandreou was wrapping up a two-day visit to Washington that also focused on the Cyprus dispute.
Meanwhile, taxi drivers in Athens and Attica launched a 48-hour strike Wednesday, demanding that they be allowed to raise fares.
They are also protesting government plans to make them use electronic cash registers in their vehicles, as well as the cabinet's refusal to allow use of bus lanes by taxis.

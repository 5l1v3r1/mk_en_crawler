BELGRADE, Serbia -- Local media reported on Wednesday (May 12th) that Serbia will have to pay 36m euros in damages to an Israeli company for violating a contract to rent a spy satellite.
Belgrade also reportedly must pay about 13,800 euros in legal fees.
The International Court of Arbitration in Paris ruled in favour of the Israeli company, ImageSet, in 2008.
Serbia, however, tried to challenge that court's jurisdiction, taking the case to a London court, where it lost.
The 45m-euro satellite deal was signed in 2005 by the then Serbia and Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, who allegedly failed to consult with the government.
Daily Blic is reporting that prosecutors plan to file charges against him next week.

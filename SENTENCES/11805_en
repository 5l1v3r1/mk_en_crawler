THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Saturday (16 April) that it would briefly release former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj from custody to attend the funeral of his brother. 
Enver Haradinaj, a 23-year-old student, was shot dead in Kosovo on Friday in what UN police described as a dispute between two clans. 
Police sources say the murder was not politically motivated. 
Haradinaj lost two brothers in fighting against Yugoslav forces in 1997 and 1998. 
A fourth brother was convicted of murder.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), Vojislav Kostunica, said on Sunday (February 14th) that calling early elections is the main goal of his party.
At a DSS congress, Kostunica accused the government of endangering the country "economically, socially, politically and morally".
"It is time for elections, time to stop the agony and destruction of Serbia â€¦ It is time for a new Serbian government that will stop separatism and further divisions in the country," Kostunica said.
The opposition Serbian Progressive Party is leading a petition drive to force early elections.

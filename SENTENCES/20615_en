TIRANA, Albania -- Nikolle Lesi, a parliament member and former leader of the Christian Democratic Party (PDK), announced on Thursday (November 8th) the establishment of a new political party, the Albanian Christian Democratic Movement.
Lesi left the PDK earlier this year due to a conflict with the new party leader, Nard Ndoka.
Lesi said the new formation would largely rely on PDK supporters and predicted it would at least match the PDK's performance in the 2005 general elections.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras presented a government plan Thursday (27 April) to combat human trafficking at the regional level. 
The plan envisions increased regional co-operation among ministries, police forces and other agencies in tackling the problem. 
The plan would be implemented in Greece and then "exported" to Balkan states.

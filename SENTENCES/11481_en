ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan said Sunday (22 May) that Turkey would accept nothing less than full membership in the EU. 
The comment followed reports in Turkish newspapers outlining details of a French proposal to offer Turkey a "privileged partnership" with the Union instead of membership.
On Friday, meanwhile, Turkish State Minister Ali Babacan predicted accession talks could continue for ten years. 
He was speaking to Spanish reporters after a conference in Madrid.

MOSCOW, Russia -- A Russian news agency reported on Wednesday (9 April) that the government was considering pulling out its nearly 1,000 troops from the peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Interfax said it has learned the Kremlin wants to save the $25m it spends annually to maintain the force. 
The move could take several months to complete.

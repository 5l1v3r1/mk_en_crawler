PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister and Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander Ramush Haradinaj returned to Pristina on Friday (April 4th) after being cleared of all charges by The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) on Thursday. 
His supporters waved flags of the new independent Kosovo and blocked traffic near the airport for an hour before his arrival.
Meanwhile, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged ICTY prosecutors on Saturday to immediately appeal the verdict. 
On Friday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica suggested that the EU should evaluate the actions of the ICTY during the investigation of Haradinaj.
In other news, Serb nationalists on Saturday launched their campaign for Serbia's early general elections on May 11th with a meeting in the town of Gracanica in central Kosovo. 
"Elections are a good opportunity to vote for the people who claim that they will not give up Kosovo," Serb Radical Party (SRS) leader Tomislav Nikolic told a few thousand Serbs.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed hope on Friday (June 27th) that Serbia's new government will continue to work to speed up co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, a condition for eventual EU membership.
Rehn's spokesperson, Krisztina Nagy, said that Rehn met on Friday with tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz.
They discussed co-operation shown by countries in the Western Balkans, including that of Serbia, following fugitive Stojan Zupljanin's recent arrest.
They also discussed the levels of co-operation shown by Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

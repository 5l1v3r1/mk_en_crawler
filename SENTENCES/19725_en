TIRANA, Albania -- Thousands of opposition party supporters took part in a rally in downtown Tirana on Friday (December 21st) against the ruling Democratic Party, accusing it of being responsible for the energy crisis, water shortage, low salaries and pensions, and large-scale corruption in the country. 
Socialist Movement for Integration leader Ilir Meta told the crowd that most Albanians have run out of patience and want to change the current government. 
He blamed Prime Minister Sali Berisha for promising people they would have electricity 24-hours a day. 
"Actually there is nothing but darkness," Meta said.
The rally ended peacefully with opposition leaders promising to continue protests against the centre-right government.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges at the UN tribunal have imposed a defence lawyer on former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to avoid further delays in his war crimes trial as a result of poor health. 
The court issued its ruling Thursday (2 September) but did not immediately name the attorney or say when he or she will be assigned. 
On Wednesday, prosecutors accused the defendant of obstructing justice by refusing to follow doctors' orders. 
Quoting from a medical report on Milosevic's health, prosecutor Geoffrey Nice told the court that the defendant was providing incorrect information about his medication intake. 
Earlier in the day, Milosevic wrapped up his opening statement by laying out a complicated conspiracy theory about the disintegration of Yugoslavia.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu and representatives of local NGOs agreed on Monday (January 22nd) to form a panel that will monitor how well political parties follow the code of conduct in the run up to the February 18th municipal elections.
Late last week, Moisiu presented the document, which outlines campaign rules.
Meeting with the NGOs, he emphasised society's role in the electoral process and urged all parties to abide by democratic standards and restrain from provocations or violence.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu said Sunday (April 4th) that he was not involved in the recent government reshuffle. 
"I am not part of these appointments and dismissals," Sejdiu stated during a visit to a Serbian family in Gracanica on the occasion of the Easter holiday. 
The president welcomed the ruling coalition's efforts to put together a team that can take on additional challenges, but also praised the work of the six ministers who were dismissed during the March 31st reshuffle.

TIRANA, Albania -- Educational institutions have initiated a plan to equate local university diplomas with those in Kosovo and Macedonia.
The Ministry of Education announced Thursday (November 26th) that Albanian-speaking universities have been notified about the initiative.
"We will start the procedures to unify and standardise university curriculum as it is required with the Bologna Process," Tirana University head Dhori Kule said.
The Bologna Process aims to create a European Higher Education Area by making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Tuesday (October 20th) that he will assess Serbia's co-operation with the court after his visit to the country early next month. 
He added that the evaluation will be part of his regular report to the UN Security Council. 
According to Brammertz, the two remaining war crimes fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic -- are in Serbia and will be captured by the end of the tribunal's term. 
Brammertz also said that the trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic could take up to three years. 
He noted that more that 400 witnesses will testify during the trial, which is set to begin on Monday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Amnesty International's 2002 annual report estimates around 11,000 refugees returned to Croatia last year, an increase over 2001 figures. 
But representatives of the organisation said Wednesday (28 May) that problems with property restitution continue and that the country was not fully co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The report also warned that domestic courts prosecuting Serbs and Croats for war crimes were mostly incapable of conducting unbiased and independent trials.
In other news, the finance ministry reported Wednesday that Croatia's Office for the Prevention of Money Laundering has logged 840 cases of suspicious financial transactions over the past five years, some of which may have been linked to terrorist groups.

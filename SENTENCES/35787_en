PRESEVO, Serbia-Montenegro -- The ethnic Albanian press in southern Serbia reported Thursday (1 April) that KFOR troops have arrested a prominent former guerrilla leader. 
Jonuz Musliu was the political head of the rebel Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac before it was disbanded in 2001. 
His current party, the Movement for Democratic Progress, said Musliu was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the violence in Kosovo which erupted in mid-March. 
There is an unconfirmed report that another official was detained with him.

TIRANA, Albania -- Swiss lawmaker and Council of Europe member Dick Marty is being sued by an Albanian family whose house is mentioned in reports alleging human rights abuses. 
Media in Tirana reported on Wednesday (March 30th) that the Brama family, living in the so-called "Yellow House" in northern Albania, is seeking compensation over reports stemming from Marty's allegations of human organ trafficking. 
Marty has described the house as an illegal, makeshift hospital that the former Kosovo Liberation Army used as a centre for the transplant of human organs during the 1999 war in Kosovo. 
The plaintiffs want Marty to rebut the claims and pay about 15,000 euros in damages.

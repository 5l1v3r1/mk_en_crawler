ATHENS, Greece -- The high-tech blimp leased to enhance Olympic security made its maiden voyage Friday (23 July) after several delays due to bad weather. 
The 61m-long sky ship is equipped with high-resolution cameras and chemical contamination detectors. 
The blimp will patrol at an altitude of 1,200m over the Greek capital 16 hours a day during the Games. 
The first two-hour test flight was described as successful. 
That same day, the Olympic Flame arrived in Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki. 
It will be carried into the Olympic Stadium on 13 August for the opening ceremony.
In other news, three police officers were seriously injured Friday when they were attacked by about 50 youths on the sidelines of a concert in downtown Athens. 
The attackers stole the officers' identification papers and a gun.

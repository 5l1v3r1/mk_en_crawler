TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu will mediate efforts to resolve divisions over the controversial property bill, the Albanian Daily News reported Tuesday (22 June). 
The bill was approved by the ruling Socialist Party in parliament while the opposition was absent, a move which resulted in strong criticism from the OSCE. 
Moisiu says he will set up discussions to resolve the dispute. 
He has not decided whether to endorse the measure, saying he hopes to get a better understanding of it and the issues surrounding it.

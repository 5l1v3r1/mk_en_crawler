ANKARA, Turkey -- In separate statements Sunday (January 28th), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Justice Minister Cemil Cicek stressed that the government is ready to amend controversial Article 301 of the penal code.
However, Erdogan added that no concrete proposals have been submitted, and urged the public and NGOs to submit their ideas to the cabinet.
While asserting the government is open to proposals, Erdogan said he believes the article should not be completely annulled.
Article 301 stipulates that "insulting Turkishness" is a crime.
Critics, including the EU, consider it a major barrier to freedom of expression in Turkey.

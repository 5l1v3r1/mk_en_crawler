BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic is asking African countries not to recognise Kosovo's independence.
Addressing the African Union summit Monday (June 30th) in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Tadic said Serbia plans to bring its dispute with Kosovo before the International Court of Justice.
He asked African countries to support Serbia's bid to get UN permission to address the court in September.
He said Africa is familiar with secession and separatist conflicts and that the Kosovo case might set a precedent.
Only three African countries have recognised Kosovo's independence so far:
Senegal, Burkina Faso and Liberia.

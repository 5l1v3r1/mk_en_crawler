TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE is urging the countries of Southeast Europe to adopt measures against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 
At a regional conference in Tirana, OSCE Ambassador Osmo Lipponen told representatives of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Slovenia that money launderers could penetrate the new economies in the Balkans because of institutional weaknesses. 
Klaus Schmidt, the EU representative in Albania, warned that money-laundering schemes are becoming increasingly sophisticated. 
He appealed to Balkan countries to increase co-operation. 
Also attending the conference are experts and advisers from the EU Police Assistance Mission to Albania, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, and the US Treasury Department.

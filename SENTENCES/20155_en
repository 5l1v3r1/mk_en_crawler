BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) and G17 Plus, a minor party in the outgoing ruling coalition, say they plan to form a joint ticket in the May 11th elections. 
Voters will be choosing among candidates for parliament and local offices, as well as for provincial posts in Vojvodina. 
The coalition deal was confirmed on Sunday (March 16th) by G17 Plus leader Mladjan Dinkic and DS vice-president Bojan Pajtic. 
G17 Plus supported Tadic in his tight race for re-election, so analysts say formalising the alliance was a logical step. 
Dinkic said Serbia is once again at a crossroads and has to choose between the EU and self-isolation. 
The DS-led ticket will also include the Social Democratic Party, which represents the interests of the Bosniak ethnic minority. 
Other minorities might join later.

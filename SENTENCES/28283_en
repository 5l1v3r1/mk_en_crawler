ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday (April 18th) that his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) stands firmly behind a 30-article constitutional amendment package, which parliament is expected to discuss Monday.
Speaking to the private NTV news channel, Erdogan criticised the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party's (CHP) for threatening to challenge the constitutionality of some of the reforms while supporting others.
The CHP then urged President Abdullah Gul to help resolve disagreements over the package.
Erdogan said the AKP will not back down, working instead to ensure passage of all the reforms, many of which affect the judiciary.
By law, parliament can amend the constitution if a proposal is backed by 367 of the 550 lawmakers.
If they attract at least 330 votes, the amendments can be put to a public referendum.

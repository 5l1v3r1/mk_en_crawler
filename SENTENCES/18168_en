BUCHAREST, Romania -- Commenting for the first time Thursday (April 12th) on a move in Parliament to impeach him, President Traian Basescu indicated he would resign and force snap elections that he would likely win easily, rather than wait for a national referendum on impeachment that he would also easily win. 
Basescu told Cotidianul newspaper that he wants voters -- not lawmakers -- to decide his future. 
The parliamentary vote is just part of the impeachment procedure, as it has to be confirmed via a national referendum.
In other news Thursday, Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu met with the US and British ambassadors to Romania, Nicholas Taubman and Robin Barnett, to discuss the pull out of Romanian forces from Iraq. 
Melescanu says it could happen by the end of the year.

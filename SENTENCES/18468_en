ROME, Italy -- Prime Minister Romano Prodi called Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader on Tuesday (February 13th) to express outrage over Croatia's reaction to a statement by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.
Italy also cancelled a visit by a cabinet minister to Zagreb.
The row erupted on Saturday when Napolitano said in a speech that the late communist leader Tito's guerillas had killed thousands of Italians in what he termed "a Slavic plan of annexation" similar to "ethnic cleansing".
On Monday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic accused Napolitano of "open racism, historical revisionism and political revanchism".
He and Sanader are calling for the establishment of a forensic commission to investigate the alleged acts of genocide.
According to some historians, between 5,000 and 15,000 Italians were massacred in the mid-1940s as Yugoslav communists established control of border areas.
The ongoing spat could potentially create problems for Croatia's EU membership bid.
Thus far, the European Commission has refrained from comment.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu declared Monday (November 2nd) a day of national mourning for a group of Kosovo Albanians who drowned in the Tisza River as they tried to enter Hungary illegally from Serbia in mid-October. 
So far, eight bodies have been recovered and identified. 
Survivors say at least twice that many were aboard the boat that capsized and sank. 
Political parties in Kosovo are suspending campaign activities Monday in observance of the mourning period.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament decided Friday (27 June) to establish a special commission to investigate the fate of those still missing since the 2001 military conflict. 
Only the main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, voted against the proposal, arguing that it merely confirms the inability of the interior ministry to resolve the cases. 
Interior Minister Hari Kostov disagreed, saying the aim is to form an impartial and competent body to handle the matter. 
Representatives of the missing persons' families would be among the panel members.

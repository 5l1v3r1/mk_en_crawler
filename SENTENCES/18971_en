SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The families of the victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, in which more than 8,000 men were slaughtered by Bosnian Serb forces, plan to file a lawsuit against the UN and the Netherlands on Monday (June 4th), according to the Dutch law firm Van Diepen Van der Kroef. 
The firm, which is representing a group of about 6,000 families in the claim, said it would insist that the UN and the Dutch government take responsibility for their failure to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, which had been declared a UN-protected safe area for civilians. 
Both the UN and the Dutch government declined to comment on the news, saying they would wait to see more details from the complaint.

RIGA, Latvia -- On Saturday (23 May), Sertab Erener became the first Turkish singer to win the Eurovision music contest.
Phone callers from 26 countries gave her song "Every Way That I Can" a narrow victory over Belgium's Urban Trad.
The Russian Tatu duo, which had been favoured to win the contest, placed third.
Erener has sold more than four million records and has recorded songs with Ricky Martin and Jose Carreras.
Turkey's best previous performance in this contest came in 1997, when Erener won the third spot.

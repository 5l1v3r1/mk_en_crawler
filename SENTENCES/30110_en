ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul received the chairman of the Afghan Peace Council, Burhanuddin Rabbani, at a luncheon at the Cankaya Presidential Palace on Wednesday (February 23rd). 
Rabbani, a former president of Afghanistan, is leading a delegation of ten representatives of the 68-strong council, who arrived on a four-day visit to Ankara on Tuesday. 
The group met with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Parliament Speaker Mehmet Ali Sahin to discuss situation in Afghanistan. 
In December 2010, Gul said he would help foster reconciliation talks between the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the Taliban. 
Publically, the Taliban have said they would not join any talks as long as NATO troops remain in Afghanistan.

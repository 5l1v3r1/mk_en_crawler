ATHENS, Greece -- EU financial experts began analysing Greece's austerity plan in Athens on Monday (February 22nd), assessing reform measures proposed by the government to cut the huge budget deficit.
Analysts -- including representatives of the European Central Bank and the IMF -- will determine whether the measures will be sufficient to cut the deficit from 12.7% of GDP at the moment to under 3% by 2012.
They will present their findings to the European Commission early next month, after which the EU will decide whether Athens needs additional measures.
Greece missed Friday's deadline to submit more details about deals with Wall Street banks that the country allegedly used to hide its actual financial state.
Athens blamed the delay on last week's four-day strike by Finance Ministry officials.
The ministry has said that the deals were legal, at the time.
Goldman Sachs, which struck a currency swap deal with Greece in 2001, said on Monday that it did "nothing inappropriate".

STRASBOURG, France -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen went before the European Parliament's foreign affairs commission on Monday (28 April), saying Turkey's military should be under civilian control and not the other way around.
He added that Turkey needs to harmonise its legislation with regard to civilian control over the military, in line with EU regulations.
Verheugen also noted that accession negotiations with Turkey might start as early as in 2005.
The same day, Turkish Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said there is broad political support for efforts to joint the Union.

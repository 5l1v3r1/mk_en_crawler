SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) President Rene van der Linden made a speech to the BiH Parliament on Friday (7 July), telling lawmakers that BiH must pursue crucial constitutional changes if it wants to join the EU. 
He said the country could not afford to spend 60 per cent of its GDP on maintaining an oversized state apparatus, nor conduct efficient accession negotiations with the EU as long as it has a total of five presidents (three members of the state presidency and two entity ones), three parliaments, 13 premiers and over 180 ministers (state, entity and cantonal ones).

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Monday (13 February) that he is confident about Croatia's prospects of becoming the 28th EU member, although the 2000 Nice Treaty does not envision the admission of any other specific country after Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.
Rehn said he was sure that by the time Croatia completes its accession talks, the Union will have resolved its institutional and constitutional issues.
Also Monday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader met with the ambassadors of the EU member and candidate states.
The focus was the pace of Croatia's accession process.
In other news, Sanader rejected a new proposal from Slovenia for an interim agreement on a border dispute that began in 1991.
Zagreb is seeking international arbitration to determine the equal distribution of the Piran Bay and sea territories between the two former Yugoslav states.

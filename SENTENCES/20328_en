SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski hinted on Wednesday (September 12th) that Macedonia would withdraw from negotiations with Greece over the longstanding name dispute if Athens blocks its NATO membership bid.
He was responding to a recent comment by Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who warned that Athens would veto Skopje's NATO membership unless the name dispute is resolved.
"If this statement is put into practice ...
it would mean that Greece is blatantly violating and even invalidating the Interim Agreement between the two countries.
Consequently, it would mean that all obligations on the part of Macedonia were suspended, including the one regarding the resumption of negotiations to overcome the name differences under UN auspices," Crvenkovski said.

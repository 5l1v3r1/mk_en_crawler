BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) announced on Saturday (June 21st) that it is suspending talks with the Serbian Radical Party and the Democratic Party of Serbia aimed at forming a governing coalition. 
SPS leader Ivica Dacic says it boiled down to major differences of opinion over Serbia's EU accession. 
The SPS-led coalition is now considering launching talks with representatives of the For a European Serbia coalition, led by President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS). 
The DS won the May 11th parliamentary elections, but not by enough to govern alone.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The EU's agency to fight money laundering and embezzlement, OLAF, will monitor closely the absorption of EU funds by the end of the year, Deputy Prime Minister Meglena Plugchieva told state radio on Sunday (June 15th). 
OLAF will carry out regular audits, Plugchieva said, to guarantee that there are no more violations of EU procedures. 
OLAF is currently checking the absorption of funds within the SAPARD programme. 
Results from that audit will determine whether the EU unblocks the programme, which it froze as punishment for Bulgarian violations.

ATHENS, Greece -- Former EU Commission President Jacques DeLores on Wednesday (14 January) nominated Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis to succeed current Commission President Romano Prodi.
Simitis joins Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and former Belgian Prime Minister Jean Luc Dehaene as candidates.
Prodi's term ends in October.
After the June elections for European Parliament, the European Summit Council will choose who will preside over the commission for the next five years.
In other news Wednesday, Greek officials complained that interest by travel agencies in the upcoming Athens Summer Olympics is weaker than expected.
Less than eight months ahead of the Games, only several hundred out of the 5,000 homes have been rented out.
While hotels in downtown Athens are 90 per cent booked for Olympic officials, there has been no demand in the suburbs.
The organising committee has so far sold 1.7 million out of a total of three million tickets available for purchase over the Internet.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, who leads the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), said on Friday (10 February) that relations with the ethnic Albanian government partner, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), are good. 
Buckovski was speaking with reporters a day after a regular meeting with DUI leader Ali Ahmeti. 
Buckovski explicitly denied reports that the ties between SDSM and DUI recently deteriorated over Skopje's plans to prosecute four cases returned from the UN tribunal -- involving crimes allegedly committed in 2001 by the now disbanded ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army.

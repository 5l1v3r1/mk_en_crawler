BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu sent a letter to President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (January 9th) in support of his nominee for justice minister, Senator Norica Nicolai.
Basescu had asked him to propose someone else, given Nicolai's negative public image.
In his letter, Tariceanu said Basescu ignored Nicolai's professional record and expertise, choosing instead to focus on "image issues".
According to Tariceanu, if this criterion is used, then Basescu's reputation would be damaged from actions during his tenure as mayor of Bucharest.

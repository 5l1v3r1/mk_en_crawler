BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Turkish President Abdullah Gul went before the Azerbaijani parliament on Wednesday (November 7th) and said relations between Ankara and Yerevan will not improve until Armenia stops urging the international community to recognise the World War I-era murders of Armenians as genocide. 
"Armenia should not have hopes for relations with Turkey while it deepens the happenings of 1915," he said. 
He stressed, however, that relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan remain friendly, and he reiterated Turkish support for Azerbaijan's claims to the disputed region of Nagorno Karabakh.
Earlier in the day, Gul met with Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev, who said his country supports the actions of Turkish Special Forces against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Piling more pressure on authorities in Zagreb, Washington has offered a reward of 4.4m euros for information leading to the arrest of fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina. 
The retired general is the UN war crimes tribunal's third most-wanted man. 
US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper disclosed the reward in an interview published Thursday (9 October) in the daily <I>Jutarnji List</I>. 
Gotovina has been hiding since his indictment was made public in July 2001. 
The long-established programme "Reward for Justice" has been offering cash for war crimes fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. 
But this is the first time Gotovina was mentioned in that context, according to a Reuters news agency source.

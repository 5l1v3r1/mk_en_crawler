BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Chamber of Deputies plans an extraordinary session on August 13th to discuss President Traian Basescu's demand for high-level corruption probes against former ministers, lawmakers announced on Wednesday (July 30th). 
By law, the Anti-Graft Prosecution Office can launch a probe only with parliament's approval. 
Under investigation are former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea, former Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu, former Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy, former Defence Minister Victor Babiuc, former Economy Minister Codrut Seres, former Agriculture Minister Decebal Traian Remes and current Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru. 
They are suspected of a variety of offences such as accepting bribes, using their influence to benefit relatives and engaging in deals that damaged the interests of the state. 
The president's request followed a report released last week by the European Commission that criticised Romania's poor results in fighting corruption, especially at high levels.

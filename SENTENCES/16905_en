ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks met on Tuesday (4 April) to discuss international legal disputes involving the country.
Mesic later said that they focused particularly on bilateral arguments with Slovenia -- specifically, Croatia's demand for repayment of deposits in the former Yugoslav Ljubljanska Banka, as well as disputes over the maritime border.
Sanader reiterated that Zagreb would continue to press for repayment of individual losses and would reject Slovenia's proposal to deal with the bank issue as part of the broader succession process among former Yugoslav states.

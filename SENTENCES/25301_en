LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Leaders of the main political parties agreed on Friday (March 26th) that the arbitration border agreement with Croatia will be submitted to a binding referendum, once parliament ratifies the document.
The Constitutional Court endorsed the agreement with Zagreb last week, giving parliament the green light to ratify the deal.
Croatia did so last year.
Under the agreement, the maritime border dispute will be subject to international arbitration.

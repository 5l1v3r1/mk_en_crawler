TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP), Edi Rama, warned on Friday (28 October) that the party is facing a financial crisis and does not have adequate funds for normal operations.
He made the assessment at a meeting of the SP presidency.
The shortfall is due to excessive spending during the campaign for the 3 July parliamentary elections, as well as unpaid member dues, Rama said.
Also on Friday, the entire chairmanship of the SP Tirana branch resigned en masses, citing the party's defeat in the July vote (Albanian News - 28/10/05)

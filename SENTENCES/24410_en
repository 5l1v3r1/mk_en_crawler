TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided on Wednesday (April 8th) to assist those in rural areas who want to apply for electronic ID cards by providing transport to registration centres. 
Marking International Roma Day on Wednesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha also promised the Roma community its members would receive ID cards free of charge. 
The opposition has been pressuring the government to provide free cards -- ahead of the elections in late June -- to all citizens who are unable to pay the 10-euro fee.

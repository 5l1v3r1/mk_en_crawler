SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Railway unions and the government struck a deal late on Thursday (March 10th) saving the country from an open-ended strike that would have left it without train service during working hours every day. 
Trains all over the country stopped for one hour Thursday in a warning action against planned job cuts and low pay in the sector. 
Under the last-minute deal, the government agreed to abandon plans to lay-off workers; it will implement cuts in the railway administration instead. 
Workers will also receive their delayed social benefits. 
The planned restructuring is part of Bulgaria's efforts to get a 300m-euro loan from the World Bank to save its seriously indebted railway sector. 
In return, the government must cut up to 30% of spending in the sector.

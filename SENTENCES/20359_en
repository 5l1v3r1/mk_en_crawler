SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency decided to postpone a session Wednesday (December 12th) at which it was expected to officially nominate Nikola Spiric as prime minister-designate. 
The presidency instead will wait for the BiH Election Commission and the State Investigation and Protection Agency to complete their routine procedures. 
The presidency also confirmed that a second candidate, Mladen Ivankovic Lijanovic, has been proposed for the prime minister post. 
Spiric resigned on November 1st over differences with High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, but the six parties in the ruling coalition agree that returning him to the post would be the most expedient course.

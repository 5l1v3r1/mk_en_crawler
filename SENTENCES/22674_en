GENEVA, Switzerland -- Serbia could join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in mid-2009, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy and Serbian Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic said on Thursday (May 8th) at a news conference after meeting in Geneva.
Dinkic insisted Sunday's elections would not stall the reform agenda, vowing that Serbia would bring its laws into line with WTO rules within a month.
He added that Belgrade plans to begin talks soon on bilateral free-trade agreements with the US, Canada, Japan, Norway and Turkey.
Serbia submitted a formal application to start entry negotiations with the WTO in December 2004.
A working group on WTO accession first met in October 2005.

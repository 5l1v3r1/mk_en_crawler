ZAGREB, Croatia -- Tests on Saturday (August 8th) showed that Legionella bacterium is not what landed former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader in hospital late Thursday, with a lung infection and high temperature. 
Doctors say he is improving but will undergo more tests. 
Sanader resigned unexpectedly as prime minister last month, without citing a specific reason, though he did say health issues were not a factor. 
Jadranka Kosor succeeded him in office.

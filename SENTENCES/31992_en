PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- President Milo Djukanovic will submit his resignation Monday (25 November) so that he can serve as prime minister, says Igor Luksic, an official from his Democratic Party of Socialists. 
Djukanovic was nominated for prime minister after his party won last month's parliamentary election. 
By law, Parliament Speaker Filip Vujanovic will serve as caretaker president until the presidential elections on 22 December. 
There is no clear favorite in the race following Djukanovic's decision not to seek re-election.

TIRANA, Albania -- A UN study has concluded that Albania needs a total of $21.1 billion to combat poverty over the next ten years, local media reported Thursday (27 January). 
The study found that some 25 per cent of the population lives in poverty, with 5 per cent of them in severe poverty. 
UNDP statistics, meanwhile, show that only 65 per cent of aid contributed over the past 10 years has been utilised.
In other news, parliamentary deputies are at odds over the situation in northeast Albania, an area isolated by heavy snow. 
Opposition lawmakers blame the government for failing to respond to emergency situations, but the government insists aid has been provided.

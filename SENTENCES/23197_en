ANKARA, Turkey -- Environment Minister Veysel Eroglu announced on Friday (May 30th) that Turkey is ready to join the Kyoto Protocol in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Turkey initially refused to sign the UN protocol on global warming, arguing it must first complete its industrial development. 
The country, however, is under EU pressure to improve its environmental standards.

ATHENS, Greece -- The General Confederation of Workers of Greece (GSEE), the country's major trade union, announced on Tuesday (August 26th) plans for a big rally on September 6th to protest the government's economic policy. 
The announcement came in response to a statement by Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis, who said the government has no plans to change its economic policy, regardless of the consequences. 
Over the past week, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis held several meetings with trade union and business representatives, where he confirmed the government will not approve a "special subsidy of solidarity" for the lowest-paid workers. 
The GSEE-led protest will coincide with the opening of the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, where the prime minister traditionally announces the government's economic plans for the year ahead.

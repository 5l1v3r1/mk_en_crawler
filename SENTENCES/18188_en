SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the main political parties met in Sarajevo on Friday (February 16th) but failed again to agree on crucial BiH police restructuring, which is key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
The process has been stalled for months due to Republika Srpska's objections to abolishing its entity police force. 
Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian, a sponsor of the talks, is quoted in Sunday's edition of Dnevni avaz as saying Friday's round was constructive and may lead to an agreement by the end of this week.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Tuesday (February 20th) approved a cabinet shuffle aimed at making the government more efficient at implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
Xhelil Bajrami is the new minister of environment and physical planning, while his predecessor, Imer Aliu, became a minister without portfolio.
Aliu also takes up the post of deputy prime minister in charge of implementing the Ohrid Agreement.
He will succeed Imer Selmani, who remains at the helm of the health ministry.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski says reforms related to Ohrid and to the health sector are too sweeping to be handled simultaneously.
In other news Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister in charge of EU Integration Gabriela Konevska-Trajkovska said Macedonia would aim to meet EU membership criteria by 2010.
She was attending a conference in Brussels, organised by the European Policy Centre think-tank.

TIRANA, Albania -- Ambassadors from EU countries expressed concern Tuesday (October 14th) over the Albanian government's decision to probe the legality of a prosecutor's investigation of Bosnian businessman Damir Fazlic. 
The move represents serious interference with the judiciary's work, they warned. 
Fazlic allegedly conducted illegal financial activity and improper business relations with government officials, including Prime Minister Sali Berisha.

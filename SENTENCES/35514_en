BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Tens of thousands of people gathered in Belgrade on Thursday (10 June) for the final rallies of Serbia's top presidential candidates.
The election will be held Sunday.
Democratic Party candidate Boris Tadic told supporters that he would continue the policies of slain Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, which he said would take Serbia into the EU.
Dragan Marsicanin, the candidate of the ruling coalition, promised that he would work for a democratic state, the rule of law, the establishment of institutions, fair reform and economic development.
Bogoljub Karic, considered Serbia's wealthiest man, wrapped up his campaign with a pledge to rebuild the country's economy.
His rally ended with a fireworks display.
Meanwhile, the top suspect in Djindjic's assassination, Milorad "Legija" Lukovic, refused to enter a plea in court Thursday, arguing that his statement could influence the election.
The court scheduled a new hearing for Monday.

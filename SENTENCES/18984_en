TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Libyan Foreign Ministry has confirmed that talks are under way for the resolution of the case of six foreign medics -- five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor -- who were sentenced to death in a controversial HIV infection trial.
"There are contacts and negotiations to find a solution satisfactory to all parties," the ministry said in statement released over the weekend.
It cautioned Western governments not to try to press for the release of the medics, saying the independence of Libya's justice system must be respected.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said Wednesday (23 June) that adoption of the country's defence strategy should not be delayed.
His statement comes in response to criticism from Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who says the strategy is flawed and needs revision.
"Any objections that are soundly based will easily be included in the defence strategy.
No one in the defence ministry will attempt to slow this down," said Davinic.

TIRANA, Albania -- Economy Minister Arben Malaj announced on Monday (1 September) that the free trade agreement between Albania and Kosovo has been implemented.
It came into effect after implementation of two similar agreements -- one between Albania and Macedonia, and another between Albania and Croatia.
The document, signed 7 July by Malaj and former UNMIK chief Michael Steiner, foresees immediate abolition of customs duties for 50 per cent of the goods traded between Kosovo and Albania.
In six years, 90 per cent of the goods would be duty-free.

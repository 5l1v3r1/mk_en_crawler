BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor's office has made progress in an investigation into alleged organ harvesting, prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Sunday (December 27th) in an interview with Belgrade-based daily Blic. 
He said his office has identified people who were present in a house in northern Albania when organ removals took place. 
Serbia is investigating claims that Kosovo Albanians abducted hundreds of Serb prisoners of war, taking them from Kosovo to Albania where their organs were harvested for sale abroad near the end of the conflict in 1999. 
The claims appeared first in a book published last year by former UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
Vukcevic says some potential witnesses are unwilling to testify, fearing revenge. 
He added that new information was delivered several days ago to Council of Europe Special Rapporteur Dick Marty, who is investigating the case.

VIENNA, Austria -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic demanded on Tuesday (February 19th) in a speech to the OSCE that Organisation members denounce Kosovo's declaration of independence.
He reiterated that Serbia would never acknowledge Kosovo and would always consider it part of its territory.
Jeremic insisted that Sunday's independence declaration by Kosovar Albanians was a blatant violation of all international agreements, including the UN Charter.
"History will judge those who have chosen to trample on the bedrock of the international system and on the principles upon which security and co-operation in Europe have been established," he said.
Serbia plans to try to prevent Kosovo from joining international organisations, including the OSCE.

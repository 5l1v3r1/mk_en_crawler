PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather and Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu met on Wednesday (December 27th) and agreed that the security situation in the province is generally good.
According to a statement from Sejdiu's office, the officials agreed that there are no tangible threats to stability and peace.
On Tuesday, a Kosovo Serbian leader, Marko Jaksic, who is also a member of the Serbian negotiation team in the status talks, said there could be no repetition of the March 2004 ethnic violence in the province.
He said isolated violent acts and ethnically-motivated attacks could not be ruled out, but urged Kosovo Albanians to refrain from violence in the pursuit of political goals.

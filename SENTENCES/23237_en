NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A UN programme to clear land mines from the buffer zone on the divided island of Cyprus could end in January because of a lack of funds, the UN-backed Mine Action Centre said on Monday (December 29th). 
Funding worth 9m euros, allocated by the EU, will end next month, the agency warned. 
Since late 2004, experts have removed more than 9,000 land mines from the buffer zone dividing the Turkish and the Greek parts of the island. 
The project's schedule projects two more years of mine clearing.

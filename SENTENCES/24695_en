ATHENS, Greece -- By a slim margin early Tuesday (May 5th), parliament voted against indicting former Aegean minister and current parliament member Aristotelis Pavlidis over corruption claims. 
The ruling New Democracy (ND) party member is suspected of demanding bribes from a local ship owner in exchange for subsidised ferry routes. 
He denies the allegations. 
By law, only parliament can investigate acting or former ministers for possible criminal offences. 
If lawmakers had voted to oust Pavlidis and strip him of immunity, the ND would have lost its one-seat majority in parliament and would have been forced to hold early elections.

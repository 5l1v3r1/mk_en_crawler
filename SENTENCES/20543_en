SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes court announced on Tuesday (March 11th) an indictment against former Bosnian Serb army commander Momir Savic in connection with the 1992 murder, torture and other inhuman acts against Muslims in the eastern town of Visegrad.
The court said that Savic, along with other Serb soldiers, executed ten Muslim civilians in May 1992.
He was arrested last December.
Also Tuesday, BiH police raided the homes of Nebojsa Cavic and Ratko Lopatic, in the former Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale.
Both men served as bodyguards to former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has been on the run for 12 years.

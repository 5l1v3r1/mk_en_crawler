PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A delegation consisting of the ambassadors of the 15 members of the UN Security Council wrapped up its two-day fact-finding mission in Kosovo on Saturday (April 28th).
The envoys met top Kosovo politicians and representatives of the Serb community in the province.
Their mission was to gather first-hand information on the situation before voting on a plan proposed by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu assured the ambassadors that Serbs would be safe if the province is granted independence as suggested in the blueprint.
The delegation visited the divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica and the Serb village of Svinjare, most of which was destroyed by ethnic Albanians during riots in 2004.
It also visited the village of Mala Krusa, where 116 Albanian men were killed by Serbian troops in 1999.
Belgium's ambassador to the UN and leader of the group, Johan Verbeke, told reporters on Saturday that the Security Council will need more time to make a decision.
"Deciding on important issues should never be hostage to predetermined deadlines.
You have to give it natural space and time in order for all parties of the Security Council to feel at ease with the solution," he said.
According to international media reports, his statement signals continued division in the Security Council over Kosovo's future.

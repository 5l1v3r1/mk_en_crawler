ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government Friday (4 October) filed a formal request with the UN tribunal's appeals chamber asking for an annulment of the court's decision to indict and arrest wartime Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko. 
The retired general is charged with war crimes for his command of the 1993 operation in the Medak pocket, in which dozens of Serbs were killed and their villages torched. 
The government is arguing that Bobetko was commanding a legitimate military operation to free territory belonging to Croatia. 
Saturday, President Stipe Mesic said on national TV that he supported the government's decision, adding that Croatians should not fear international sanctions as everything was being done in accordance with the tribunal's rules.
In other news, Croat and US military troops on Friday wrapped up a four-day joint exercise that simulated combined sea and air raids followed by anti-terrorist combat on the Croat islands of Zirje and Kaprije in the Adriatic Sea. 
Croatian Deputy Defence Minister Zlatko Gareljic said the exercise confirmed his country's strategic role as a future member of NATO.

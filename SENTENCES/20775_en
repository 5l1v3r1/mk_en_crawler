IZMIR, Turkey -- Prosecutors in the southern city of Antalya demanded on Thursday (September 6th) prison sentences of up to 46-years for two men accused of hijacking an Atlas Jet passenger plane last month. 
The trial against Egyptian Momen Abdul Aziz Talikh and Turkish accomplice Mehmet Resat Ozlu is being held in Izmir. 
On August 18th, they allegedly attempted to divert a plane to Iran or Syria, shortly after the aircraft left northern Cyprus bound for Istanbul. 
Witnesses say the two claimed they were al-Qaeda members and threatened the crew with a "bomb" made of modelling clay.

ATHENS, Greece -- Guests at Hotel Nepheli in Thessaloniki were evacuated on Friday (November 6th) after two people died in the hotel of carbon monoxide poisoning. 
The two victims, men aged 27 and 28, were found dead in their rooms on Thursday and Friday. 
The reason for the excessive level of carbon monoxide in the hotel is still unclear. 
The owner of the hotel, situated in the Thessaloniki suburb of Panorama, has been arrested. 
This is not the first such incident in Greece. 
In 2006, two British children died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in a hotel on the island of Corfu.
Separately, local media reported on Sunday that one person has died from floods caused by torrential rains across the country. 
The body of a 48-year-old man was found near the northern town of Grevena. 
Another man has been reported missing in the neighbouring region of Pela.

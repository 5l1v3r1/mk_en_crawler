SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A meeting Tuesday (1 October) between Nikola Popovski of the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) and Azis Polozani of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) marked the beginning of political talks between the leading Macedonian and ethnic Albanian parties. 
The talks are being described as "informal". 
It appears that the two parties already have begun discussing the terms of their future co-operation. 
The first issue tackled during the talks was that of parliamentary chairman: SDSM says if DUI supports a SDSM candidate for that post during the new assembly's constituent session Thursday, negotiations on distributing ministries could begin the same day. 
If not, SDSM says it would have to re-consider its offer and talks with DUI would be postponed until next week.

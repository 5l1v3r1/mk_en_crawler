ROME, Italy -- The defence ministers of the EU proposed Saturday (4 October) that the organisation assume control of the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) from NATO in mid-2004. 
They say the new mission should be half the size of SFOR, or about 6,000 service personnel, to reflect the improved situation in BiH. 
The EU Police Mission has been active in BiH since the start of this year, when it took over policing responsibilities from the UN. 
The EU has also taken over NATO's peacekeeping tasks in Macedonia.

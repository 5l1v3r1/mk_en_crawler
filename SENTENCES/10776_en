SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Following the release of the European Commission's (EC) progress report on Bulgaria, Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg expressed satisfaction Wednesday (6 October) with confirmation of the 2007 accession target and pledged that Bulgaria would meet all membership criteria by then.
Regarding EC criticism of delays in judicial reform and other areas, Saxe-Coburg and other officials said the cabinet had a strategy for resolving such problems.
In Bucharest, the government described the EC report on Romania as "good news", both in terms of setting 2007 as the accession date and formally recognising the functioning marketing economy.
Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana quickly announced the preparation of a medium-term roadmap for accession and an action plan to address weaknesses cited in the report.

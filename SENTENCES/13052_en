ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul says Turkey may scrap a law that makes it a criminal offence to criticise the military or discuss the killings of Armenians during World War I. The legislation, part of Turkey's new Criminal Code, has been used to indict Orhan Pamuk, a leading writer.
A number of journalists have been convicted under the same provisions.
"We're trying to make Turkey a country in which democracy and human rights are as valid as in any EU country," Gul told NTV on Wednesday (28 December), referring to the need for change.
He also criticised a group of nationalist lawyers for starting a series of controversial trials and criminal investigations.

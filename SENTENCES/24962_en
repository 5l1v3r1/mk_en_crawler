BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government on Friday (January 30th) began unilaterally implementing an interim trade agreement with the EU, as part of the larger Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The interim deal envisions gradually reducing customs charges on goods imported from the EU over the next six years, before fully abolishing the charges.
In this first year, Serbia is to cut customs fees on raw materials by 70% and on agricultural products by 80% to 95%.
The Netherlands has effectively frozen implementation of the SAA until Serbia arrests war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic.

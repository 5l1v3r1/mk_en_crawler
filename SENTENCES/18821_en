BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried has again urged Republika Srpska (RS) authorities to arrest and hand over all remaining fugitives to the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. 
Fried visited Banja Luka for talks Thursday (April 5th) with top RS defence and military officials before wrapping up his two-day visit to BiH. 
He put particular emphasis on the need to capture wartime Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic, who is on tribunal's most-wanted list. 
Fried also reaffirmed that the United States would continue supporting the restructuring of BiH's armed forces.
Later Thursday, Fried headed to Zagreb, where he met with Croatian President Stipe Mesic and reiterated US support for Croatia's efforts to join NATO and the EU.

TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama on Tuesday (December 9th) again criticised the government for a series of high-level corruption cases. 
"Albanians are now looking for justice," Rama told a press conference to mark the International Day against Corruption. 
He cited in particular the still unresolved case of the March ammunition explosions in Gerdec, which killed 26 people, and an alleged corruption scheme related to the accident. 
He also accused the cabinet of stealing hundreds of millions of euros from an infrastructure project to build the Durres-Kukes Highway.

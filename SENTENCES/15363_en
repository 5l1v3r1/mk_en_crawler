BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic sent a letter of protest Sunday (28 May) regarding the boycott under way against Serbian products in Kosovo. 
Tadic urged UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen to intervene in ending what he described as the "undemocratic and anti-European act". 
Last week, a youth movement in Pristina called on Albanians to stop buying food items and other products made in Serbia.
In other news Sunday, G17 Plus, the junior ruling coalition partner in Serbia, announced that it is nominating Agriculture Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic to the post of deputy prime minister. 
Former G17 Plus leader Miroljub Labus resigned from it earlier this month, after the EU called off negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement due to the lack of war crimes co-operation.

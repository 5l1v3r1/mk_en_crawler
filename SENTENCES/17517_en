SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity's (PDP) central committee unanimously approved a decision to join VMRO-DPMNE's ruling coalition on Sunday (May 20th). 
On Saturday, PDP leader Abdullah Vejseli agreed with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski that PDP would get the Local Self-government Ministry, will nominate the Interior Ministry's chief secretary and will also have the CEO positions in several public companies. 
PDP is lobbying its former ally, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), to abandon its boycott of Parliament. 
The two parties left it several months ago over the ruling coalition's treatment of legislation related to the rights of ethnic Albanians. 
On Friday, DUI expressed satisfaction with recent developments related to dialogue with the government, and hinted it might soon return to Parliament.
In other news, Macedonia's main opposition group, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM), suggests that the government might be trying to intimidate opponents via state institutions. 
Party spokesman Emilian Stankovic's comments Sunday followed word that the State Revenues Agency has begun inspecting SDSM's financial activities.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Thursday (9 January), the cabinet adopted a national programme against drug abuse which includes testing in schools, universities and military units. 
Professional drivers would also be subject to tests. 
The government recommends that the ministry of interior and the customs services participate more actively in the prevention of drug trafficking. 
Police departments are to intensify efforts in the vicinity of schools, discos and bars. 
Treatment and rehabilitation also will be emphasised. 
Official estimates suggest that, out of some 15,000 heroin addicts, about 70 per cent are not getting state medical treatment.

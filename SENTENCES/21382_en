ANKARA, Turkey -- Natural gas supplies from Iran to Turkey were suspended following a blast Monday (May 26th) that damaged the pipeline between the two countries.
Turkey's state-run BOTAS gas company says the explosion, near the Iranian border in the eastern province of Agri, occurred just after midnight.
There were no casualties.
Though the cause of the blast is unclear, Turkish authorities doubt involvement by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

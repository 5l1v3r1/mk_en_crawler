BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A fourth session of the Macedonia-EU Stabilisation and Association Council takes place in Brussels on Tuesday (July 24th).
A delegation led by Foreign Minister Antonio Milosovski is expected to brief EU officials on progress made in implementing the political and economic criteria envisioned in the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
Other topics include broader political issues, particularly the situation in the Balkans.
On Monday, Macedonia's Parliament convened a special session to discuss the country's priorities in terms of EU and NATO integration efforts.
The 13-hour session focused mainly on the agreement struck between VMRO-DPMNE and the opposition Democratic Integration Union (DUI) that eventually prompted DUI to end its lengthy boycott of parliament.
Critics say the terms of the deal were never made public.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament adopted the ombudsman's law on Tuesday (8 July).
The ombudsman, responsible for overseeing human rights and freedoms, would be elected by parliament after being nominated by the president.
The law was supported only by the ruling coalition;
the opposition boycotted the session.
The ombudsman is an independent institution whose decisions lack legal power.

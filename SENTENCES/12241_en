BUCHAREST, Romania -- Twenty-three European non-profit organisations have issued a statement urging the EU to continue with its enlargement process, despite the French and Dutch rejection of the new European Constitution. 
Representatives of these groups met in Romania on Sunday (12 June). 
They sent a letter to Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who holds the EU's rotating presidency, saying that the promise of a future in the EU has been a strong factor in strengthening democracy and healing ethnic divisions.

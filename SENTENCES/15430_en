ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has said in an interview that Croatia is the next candidate for EU entry, following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. 
In the interview published in Friday's (26 May) edition of the Austrian newspaper Wiener Zeitung, and widely quoted by Zagreb media, Rehn suggested that Croatia might join by 2010, if the Union adopts a new constitution and institutional framework by then.

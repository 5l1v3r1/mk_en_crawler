ANKARA, Turkey -- In a special statement Saturday (April 21st) some 40 citizens' groups in Malatya -- along with the governor and mayor of the town -- condemned the murders last week of three Christians by a group of young Muslims. 
The statement, signed by the bar association and the chambers of industry and commerce as well as trade unions and professional associations, stressed that the attack had inflicted great damage on Turkey's stability and peace. 
It went on to express regret that such a terrible murder happened in Malatya, known as one of the most tolerant cities in Anatolia. 
The three victims worked at a bible printing facility there.
Police officers are now guarding three printing press offices, a publishing house and a radio station, following a slew of threats against other Christian establishments.

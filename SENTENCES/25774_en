BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Social Democratic Party (PSD), the National Liberal Party (PNL), the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR) and minority representatives told Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru on Tuesday (October 20th) that they will not back his cabinet picks, which means he will lose any confidence vote in parliament. 
Furthermore, representatives of these opposition parties asked him to step down from his nomination, proposed by President Traian Basescu. 
PSD leader Mircea Geoana told reporters the meeting with Croitoru lasted about ten minutes. 
The PSD, the PNL, the UDMR and minority representatives still back Klaus Johannis for prime minister and are drafting a letter asking Basescu to withdraw Croitoru's nomination.

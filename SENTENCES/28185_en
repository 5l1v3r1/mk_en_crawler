SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several thousand people attended the funeral Monday (April 19th) of Bosnian Muslim wartime army commander General Rasim Delic. 
He was buried in Sarajevo with the highest military honours. 
Delic, 61, died last week of a heart attack as he awaited a ruling by the UN war crimes tribunal. 
He was appealing the three-year prison sentence handed down in 2008 for allowing his troops to rape, torture and murder dozens of Croats and Serbs in BiH between 1993 and 1995.

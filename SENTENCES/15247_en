SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chairmanship of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) unanimously decided on Tuesday (27 June) to nominate SDA leader Sulejman Tihic as its candidate for Bosniak member of the tripartite BiH Presidency in the October general elections. 
Tihic will thus run for a second term. 
SDA's chairmanship also decided to nominate Adil Osmanovic for Republika Srpska president.
Meanwhile, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has reaffirmed the Union's commitment to continue supporting BiH. 
However, he also called on the country's politicians to be responsible too. 
In an interview with Dnevni avaz, published on Wednesday, Rehn criticised delays in crucial police reforms and in co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

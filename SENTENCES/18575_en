THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors in the trial of former Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic asked judges at the UN tribunal on Wednesday (January 10th) to find Martic guilty of 19 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentence him to life in prison. 
Martic led a Belgrade-supported Serb rebellion and controlled a Serb ministate covering around 30% of Croatia's territory until it was overrun by Croatian forces in 1995. 
He is also accused of ordering a rocket attack on Zagreb in May 1995 that killed seven people and injured scores more. 
Martic has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
In other news, a former Bosnian Serb officer who commanded the siege of Sarajevo went on trial at the UN tribunal Thursday. 
Dragomir Milosevic, 64, is accused of waging a campaign of terror against residents of the capital.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- All the parties in parliament agreed on Thursday (April 3rd) that the next general elections should coincide with those for European Parliament, and will be held on June 14th 2009.
The lawmakers also approved the introduction of voter registration, a practice never before used in the country.
The goal is to avoid any manipulation of results at polling stations.
Critics say current voter lists contain errors and the names of voters who have since died, opening the door to election fraud.
The parties plan to meet again next week, to discuss changing the current proportional electoral system to a so-called mixed one, last used in 1990.

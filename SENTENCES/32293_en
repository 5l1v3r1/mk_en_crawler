SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The international community expects Macedonia's finance ministry to take the necessary steps to recruit minority policemen who recently graduated from six-months of international training. 
That message to Macedonian authorities was delivered at a meeting outgoing Finance Minister Nikola Gruevski held with Western envoys to Skopje on Thursday (3 October). 
International organisations have provided funding for the training of minority officers.

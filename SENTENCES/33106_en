ANKARA, Turkey -- A powerful explosion ripped through a cafe in central Ankara Tuesday (20 May), killing a woman and injuring two other people.
A police official said the blast may have been caused by liquefied petroleum gas, a highly flammable substance used for cooking and heating, or a bomb.
Officials refused to confirm reports suggesting the woman may have been a suicide bomber, or may have died when the bomb she was planting exploded prematurely.

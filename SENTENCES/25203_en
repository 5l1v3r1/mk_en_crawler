PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Minister of Local Government and Administration Sadri Ferati admitted on Wednesday (December 23rd) that the process of establishing a northern Mitrovica municipality will remain a challenge for the government next year, when local elections are expected there at some point. 
International institutions must be more engaged and EULEX must intensify its efforts to secure a better environment there, Ferati said, as he presented this year's achievements by his ministry. 
He cited the establishment of three new Serb-dominated municipalities -- Gracanica, Kllokot-Verbovc and Ranilug -- as the most significant accomplishments in the decentralisation process this year.

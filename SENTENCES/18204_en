BRIJUNI, Croatia -- Speaking at a regional meeting in Brijuni on Friday (July 13th), UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte called for more co-operation among judiciaries in order to remove all remaining obstacles to processing war crimes cases. 
War crimes prosecutors from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia attended the session. 
According to Del Ponte's spokeswoman, Olga Kavran, all participants agreed that no crime should be left unpunished and that regional judiciaries would have to assume more responsibility for pending cases, given the planned closure of The Hague tribunal. 
Kavran also said that Hague prosecutors oppose any provisional release for indicted Croatian General Ante Gotovina, who is awaiting trial before the tribunal. 
The issue was discussed during a separate meeting del Ponte held on Friday with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and President Stipe Mesic.

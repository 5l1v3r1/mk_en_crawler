SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A roundtable discussion on corruption, in the context of the 5 July parliamentary elections, was held in Skopje on Thursday (22 June).
The forum was organised by Transparency Macedonia with the support of the US Embassy.
The financing schemes of the parties involved in the elections remain vague, Transparency Macedonia Chairwoman Gabriela Jovevska said.
She estimated that 90 per cent of the activities of political parties have been financed by anonymous supporters.
Anti-corruption Commission Chairman Mihajlo Manevski said the group is doing its best to monitor financing ahead of the upcoming vote.

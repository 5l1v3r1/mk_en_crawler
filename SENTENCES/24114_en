ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul on Tuesday (December 16th) defended an internet campaign that seeks to apologise for the killing of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1917, which Armenia insists on classifying as genocide.
"Everyone can express their opinion freely," Gul told a joint press conference with visiting Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov.
The controversial campaign, launched last week by a group of Turkish intellectuals and academics, already has the support of more than 5,000 people.
But on Monday, retired diplomats and ambassadors protested the effort, saying it is "wrong and unfavourable for national interests".
At their meeting in Ankara, Gul and Parvanov discussed ways to enhance bilateral co-operation in various sectors, particularly energy.
Parvanov also pledged Bulgaria's support for Turkey's EU accession process.
In other news Tuesday, Turkish warplanes hit Kurdistan Workers' Party terrorist bases in northern Iraq, the General Staff said in a statement.
The airstrikes occurred in an area near the Qandil Mountains, in Erbil province.
Also Tuesday, Somali pirates hijacked another Turkish cargo ship.
Two others have been hijacked in the Gulf of Aden.

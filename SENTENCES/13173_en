BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A new federal defence minister could be appointed in 15 to 20 days, parliament speaker Zoran Sami said in an interview published Sunday (26 September) by the Belgrade daily Politika. 
Should consultations under way within the Serbian ruling coalition end quickly, Sami said, the next session of the federal legislature could be scheduled for the second week of October, when the resignation of Prvoslav Davinic would be adopted and the potential new nomination could be endorsed. 
Davinic stepped down over alleged involvement in a procurement scandal.

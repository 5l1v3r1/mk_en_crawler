ANKARA, Turkey -- Authorities have arrested ten Islamic militants who were allegedly plotting bomb attacks on unspecified targets, local media reported on Saturday (December 9th). 
Among the detainees is a lawyer who reportedly admitted that he is al-Qaeda's chief operative in Turkey. 
The militants were arrested during simultaneous raids on homes in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir on November 28th, the day Pope Benedict XVI began his visit to Turkey. 
There was no evidence that the group was targeting the pontiff.

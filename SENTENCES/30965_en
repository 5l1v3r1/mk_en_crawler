ANKARA, Turkey -- The Higher Election Board (YSK) announced on Tuesday (March 8th) the timetable for the June 12th general elections. 
The election process will officially begin on March 14th, and the final lists of candidates are to be announced by April 29th. 
Voting at customs gates will start on May 10th for Turkish citizens living abroad, as the YSK recently rejected a proposal to allow voting at Turkish embassies and consulates around the world.
Meanwhile, the interior, justice and transport ministers resigned on Tuesday in line with elections procedures and were replaced by their undersecretaries. 
Under the constitution, the three ministers must step down within five days of the date the election announcement is promulgated.

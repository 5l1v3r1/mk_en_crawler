BRIJUNI, Croatia -- Speaking at an annual reception for foreign diplomats Saturday (18 June), President Stipe Mesic said his country is largely prepared for EU membership. 
His statement came amid increasing concerns in Southeast Europe that internal disputes within the EU may affect the pace of the EU enlargement process. 
Earlier this year, the EU delayed the start of accession talks with Croatia for failing to arrest and extradite war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.
In other news a Croatian delegation headed by Finance Minister Ivan Suker left for Washington on Sunday to present a plan to the IMF aimed at bringing the country's budget deficit under control. 
Zagreb adopted a decision to cut subsidies and spending that should save nearly $166m. 
The move came after the IMF urged Croatia to bring its deficit down to the 3.7 per cent target specified in a loan agreement.

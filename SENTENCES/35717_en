BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Eleven children were feared dead after a bus taking a party of Bulgarians home from a school trip to Dubrovnik plunged into a swollen river in a ravine in Serbia, police said Monday (5 April). 
Fast-flowing waters in the deep gorge of the River Lim, in the mountains between Serbia and Montenegro, were hampering rescue efforts by a specialised army unit and police divers, police said. 
The bus, from the Bulgarian town of Slistoft, had 48 children and teachers aboard with two drivers. 
They had been on holiday in the Adriatic resort on the coast of Croatia.

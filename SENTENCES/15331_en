ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A radiation leak was detected over an area of 30 square meters, following the fire that destroyed a cargo terminal at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, the Turkish Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) said on Saturday (27 May).
The fire damaged containers holding medical equipment that included the radioactive isotope iodine-131.
"The radioactive sources were covered in cement" to prevent possible contamination of people or the environment, said Okay Cakiroglu, head of TAEK.

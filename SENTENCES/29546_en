PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Office (ICO) chief Pieter Feith opposes Belgrade's plan to organise elections in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo. 
In an interview with Deutsche Welle on Wednesday (March 31st), Feith said the ICO would only recognise the results of elections organised by Pristina. 
He added that opening an EU office in Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica would boost the strategy for integrating the north into Pristina institutions.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Five people died and 68 were injured when a car bomb exploded in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir on Thursday (January 3rd), sparking a huge fire. 
Officials said on Friday that eight of the injured were in critical condition. 
The bomb apparently targeted a bus carrying military personnel. 
It blew up as the vehicle passed a school. 
Three of the dead and a number of the injured were students. 
Thirty soldiers were also hurt. 
Police have arrested four people in connection with the blast. 
While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, authorities suspect elements of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party. 
The group's camps in northern Iraq have been the target of Turkish air strikes for the past several weeks.

TIRANA, Albania -- Dozens of intellectuals sent a petition to the highest state institutions Monday (February 28th) opposing a census based on ethnic and religious grounds.
A total of 52 signatures, including those of two former presidents, were added to the document, which stated that such a census interferes with basic human rights, national interests and the constitution.
According to them, the constitution guarantees minorities the right to their ethnic, cultural, religious beliefs and language, but does not require them to state them.
The intellectuals argue that such elements are not included in any of the 27 EU member states censuses.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Bucharest Court on Friday (June 26th) lifted a travel ban on far-right politician Gigi Becali that prevented him from assuming his duties as a newly-elected member of the European Parliament (MEP), media reported. 
The court overturned a lower court's decision to uphold the ban. 
Becali is under investigation on charges of kidnapping and assault. 
In the European Parliament elections on June 7th, Becali gained an EP seat as a candidate of the far-right Greater Romania Party (PRM).

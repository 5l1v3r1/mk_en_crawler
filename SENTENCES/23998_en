BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in Brussels on Monday (January 19th) attempting to revive his country's EU accession bid.
He will hold talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, European Parliament (EP) President Hans-Gert Pottering and leaders of political groups in the EP.
The visit is considered historic, as it is the first of its kind at the prime minister's level since 1996, and Erdogan's first visit to Brussels since the December 2004 EU summit, which Turkey attended as a candidate country.
Though he will focus on evaluating the state of Turkish-EU relations, other topics will likely include the global financial crisis and the situation in Gaza.

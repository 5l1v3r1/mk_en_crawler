SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is gaining more public support, according to a new poll by BBSS Gallup International.
The survey, conducted earlier this month, found that 26.4 per cent of Bulgarians support BSP.
That figure would translate into more than 54 parliamentary seats.
The ruling National Movement Simeon II came in second with 7 per cent, followed by the rightist opposition Union of Democratic Forces, with 6.5 per cent.
In other news, Transport and Communications Minister Nikolay Vassilev expressed satisfaction with the enhanced performance of the Bulgarian Marine Fleet.
Speaking during a visit to Varna on Friday, he credited tightened controls by his ministry.

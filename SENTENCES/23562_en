SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Officials wrapped up a two-day energy summit in Sofia on Saturday (April 25th) by saying uninterrupted supplies of natural gas and finding alternative routes for moving it from the Caspian region are preconditions to strengthening energy security. 
In a joint declaration, participants said strategic energy partnership and co-operation at both the regional and global level would be crucial to resolving the energy crisis in Europe. 
Recognising the need for joint efforts, senior representatives of 28 countries -- including six presidents -- focused on drafting a joint strategy for energy partnership. 
The officials included representatives of the Middle East, the Caspian region, Central Asia, as well as EU members included in the South Stream project, the US, Russia, Egypt and Qatar. 
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso represented the EU.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Foreign Minister Mate Granic was cleared of corruption charges and released from jail on Monday (10 May) after an investigating magistrate found insufficient evidence to indict him. 
Granic had acted as an intermediary in the sale of the state-run Koncar firm of which his brother-in-law, Darinko Bago, was director. 
Both men were arrested Friday on suspicion of bribery. 
Bago was cleared as well. 
Granic served as foreign minister from 1993 to 2000.
In other news Monday, Croatia signed contracts to rebuild more 2,250 war-damaged houses by the end of October. 
Last month, the government signed contracts to rebuild 1,750 dwellings, as part of the government programme for refugee return, an important step in the EU integration process.

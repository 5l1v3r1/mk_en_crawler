BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Three police officers were injured and nine Bosnian Serb fans were taken in custody after a football game between a team from Republika Srpska and one from Sarajevo. 
Local fans, angry after Borac lost to Zeleznicar, went after Zleznicar's fans. 
Police officers were pelted with rocks when they intervened. 
Zeljeznicar's players and fans needed a police escort out of Republika Srpska. 
This is the first season since the 1992-1995 war in which the teams of the Muslim-Croat and Serb entities are playing in a single championship.

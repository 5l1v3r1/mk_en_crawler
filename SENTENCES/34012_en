BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Wednesday (30 July) that the government of Serbia-Montenegro would set up a permanent committee overseeing the process of EU integration.
The Council of Ministers is expected to approve the members of the new body on Thursday.
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Trade Minister Branko Lukovac added that the committee would primarily monitor implementation of reforms defined by the EU as prerequisites for signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
Willem Blankert, an adviser with the resident delegation of the European Commission in Belgrade, said the EU would not ratify the SAA before 2007.

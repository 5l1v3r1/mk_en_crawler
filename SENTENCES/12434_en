ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte's report to the EU finds no further progress has been achieved in Croatia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, according to an open letter del Ponte sent to the European Parliament on Tuesday (8 March). 
In the letter, del Ponte said she has obtained no new information that would cause her to change her previous assessment of Zagreb's co-operation. 
She also reiterated her belief that fugitive General Ante Gotovina remains within Zagreb's reach. 
EU leaders have repeatedly said del Ponte's assessment will play a major role in the Union's decision on whether to launch accession talks with Croatia on 17 March.

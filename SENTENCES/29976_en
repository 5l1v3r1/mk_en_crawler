NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council decided on Wednesday (December 22nd) that the UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda should conclude their work by the end of 2014. 
Cases still open after that timeframe should be transferred to an International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, according to a resolution adopted by 14 votes, with Russia abstaining. 
The mechanism for cases involving the former Yugoslavia will start functioning in July 2013.

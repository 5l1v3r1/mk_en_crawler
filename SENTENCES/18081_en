SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on BiH Friday (March 16th) to make up -- this year -- for time lost last year in implementing key reforms.
In a speech to a joint session of Parliament, Rehn blamed the lengthy elections process in 2006.
"Much more could, and should, have been achieved," he said, citing police sector restructuring and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
The EU will not sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH until the two conditions are met.
Also held in Sarajevo on Friday was the 7th plenary Reform Process Monitoring session.
Afterwards, Osman Topcagic, the head of the BiH Directorate for EU Integration, told the media that the European Commission had reiterated that it expects Republika Srpska to take concrete steps arrest war crimes fugitives.
As for the Federation of BiH (FBiH), EU representatives urged lawmakers to quickly pass public broadcasting reform law, another condition of the SAA process.

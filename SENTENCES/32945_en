BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic stressed the importance of civilian control and a joint command of the BiH armed forces, following a meeting Tuesday (27 May) with foreign military attaches.
While noting a constitutional basis for the establishment of a joint command, Stankovic said the armies should remain at the entity level.
Reforming the military is a precondition for BiH membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
In other news Tuesday, BiH Minister for Human Rights and Refugees Mirsad Kebo said about 7.2m euros would be designated for support of the refugee return process in BiH this year.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Silivri on Friday (February 11th) ruled that 133 retired and serving military officers must be jailed pending the outcome of a trial against them over their alleged involvement in a plot to oust the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2003. 
Arrest warrants were issued for another 29 officers. 
The trial against 196 soldiers, including serving generals and former heads of the navy and air force, began at the end of 2010 after an operation revealed the alleged coup plans. 
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 14th.

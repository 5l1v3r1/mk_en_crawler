BERLIN, Germany -- The commander of KFOR, Lieutenant General Roland Kather, said the situation in Kosovo is "calm and almost stable", in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday (May 15th). 
He commented that in some German cities, there are three times as many incidents as in Kosovo. 
Kather acknowledged, however, a sense of nervousness on both sides in the province as a decision on Kosovo's future status draws nearer. 
He reiterated KFOR's readiness to respond to any provocations in the region.
Also Tuesday, Slovenian President Janez Drnovsek visited KFOR personnel from his country, deployed in Peja/Pec, to mark Slovenian Armed Forces' Day. 
He also met briefly with Kosovo counterpart Fatmir Sejdiu at Pristina's airport.

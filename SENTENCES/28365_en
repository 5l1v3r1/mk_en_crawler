ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Diyarbakir on Thursday (May 13th) sentenced a Kurdish-language newspaper journalist to 166 years in prison for spreading propaganda about the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Vedat Kursun, former editor of the daily Azadiya Welat, was found guilty of disseminating pro-PKK information on 103 different occasions through publishing news and photographs and of "committing a crime on behalf of the terrorist organisation". 
He insists there was no criminal intent and plans to appeal the verdict. 
He has been in custody since February 2008.

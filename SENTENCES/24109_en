SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- All Bosnian soldiers have returned home from Iraq, completing the withdrawal of troops announced earlier this month, the defence ministry said on Tuesday (December 16th). 
The pullout was completed on Monday when a 40-member infantry unit, which helped maintain security at a US military base in Baghdad, returned to Sarajevo. 
Another 50 soldiers returned last week.

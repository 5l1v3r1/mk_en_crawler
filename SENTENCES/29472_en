ANKARA, Turkey -- Seventeen people were killed late Wednesday (June 30th) in clashes between Turkish security forces and members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the southeastern province of Siirt. 
Two Turkish soldiers died and two others were injured after a PKK group attacked a military outpost. 
Three village guards supporting the military were killed in an ambush by another group of Kurdish rebels near the scene of the clashes. 
The army says 12 Kurdish rebels were killed.
Also Wednesday, Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said that Ankara has asked the United States to speed up delivery of attack helicopters Turkey has ordered to fight the PKK. 
Originally, the Super Cobras were scheduled for delivery in 2011, but Gonul says Turkey needs them this year.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on Tuesday (March 3rd) that Turkey had violated the property rights of a Greek Orthodox church on the Aegean island of Bozcaada.
The court said Turkish authorities illegally prevented a Greek Orthodox foundation, which is the rightful owner of the Kimisis Teodoku church, from registering its property.
Judges ordered Turkey to pay the foundation 105,000 euros in compensation.
The EU has repeatedly called on the Turkish government to return seized property to minorities and expand their religious and cultural freedoms as part of reforms required to become an EU member.
In other news Tuesday, Turkish Airlines announced it was ready to immediately compensate the passengers or families of passengers aboard its plane that crashed near Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport last Wednesday.
The company is offering initial payments of 50,000 euros to the families of those killed.
It offered payments of 10,000 euros to those hospitalised for more than three days and 5,000 euros to all other passengers.

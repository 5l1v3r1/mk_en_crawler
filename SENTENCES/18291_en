TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu said on Monday (January 15th) he believes that the various parties learned from the recent political crisis in the country and that their future actions would be geared to the proper conduct of the February 18th local elections. 
"There would have been no crisis... 
if a true dialogue and political co-operation between the majority and the opposition had taken place," Moisiu said. 
The same day, EU security chief Javier Solana criticised the Albanian electoral crisis, saying the country's politicians should seek to avoid a repetition of such problems in the future. 
Although a solution was finally reached, Albania's international image has suffered in the process, Solana said.

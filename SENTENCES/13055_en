SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On Friday (24 February), his second day on the job, Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev reversed a decision by predecessor Nikola Filchev regarding the confiscation of assets acquired through criminal activity. 
Filchev had maintained that all assets should receive protection under the Bulgarian Constitution. 
But Velchev says those protections extend only to property acquired legally. 
Filchev, whose mandate ended earlier this month, came under fire at the end for his stance on the matter.

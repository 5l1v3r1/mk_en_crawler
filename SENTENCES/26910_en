SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Monday (March 8th) that the European Commission (EC) backs the idea of appointing a new minister without portfolio to be responsible for EU funds absorption.
Gabrovo Mayor Tomislav Donchev is the most likely candidate to fill the position, handpicked by Borisov due to the large number of EU-funded projects initiated in his district.
Currently, Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov is responsible for improving EU funds' absorption.

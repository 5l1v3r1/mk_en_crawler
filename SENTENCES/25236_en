TIRANA, Albania -- The rapporteur for Albania in the European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Commission, Nikolaos Chountis, said on Monday (March 29th) that there are no barriers preventing the country from EU visa liberalisation. 
During a visit to Tirana, officials briefed Chountis on progress made on basic criteria, such as guaranteeing border security, personal ID documents, fighting crime and illegal trafficking.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Monday that Albania has completed the questionnaire required to receive EU candidate status, answering nearly 2,300 questions in three months. 
About 1,200 officials participated in the process, including 28 foreign experts. 
The questionnaire will be delivered to the European Commission in early April.

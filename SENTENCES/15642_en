SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of High Representative (OHR) issued a statement Thursday (21 September) praising the decision to transfer vetting responsibilities regarding new public officials from the OHR to state institutions.
However, the OHR said, authorities must take this task seriously to ensure that new government members meet basic requirements in terms of electoral eligibility and personal integrity.

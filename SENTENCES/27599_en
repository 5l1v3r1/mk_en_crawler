PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu resigned Monday (September 27th) after the Constitutional Court announced that he had violated Kosovoâs constitution by holding office and the leadership of his party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, simultaneously.
In a public address Sejdiu said that his act confirms his respect towards the judiciary, a stance that he has held all his life in respecting all institutions of Kosovo.
Sejdiu was appointed as President for a second mandate in January 2008.
He declared his position as LDK head as 'frozen' in June 2008, when the Kosovo Constitution was adopted.
An initiative by independent lawmaker Naim Rrustemi to challenge Sejdiu's holding the two posts was supported by 30 other members of parliament and sent to the Constitutional Court.
The court handed down its ruling last Friday.

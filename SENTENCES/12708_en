MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragan Covic was elected Saturday (4 June) as the leader of the main Croat party in BiH, the Croat Democratic Union, at a party congress in Mostar. 
Covic was dismissed as Croat member of the BiH presidency by High Representative Paddy Ashdown in late March, after embezzlement charges were filed against him stemming from earlier government service.
In other news, BiH signed an agreement for $70m in new assistance under the UN Development Assistance Framework and Country Programme Action Plans. 
Strategic support would be extended for sectors such as governance, education, mine removal, health and social services.

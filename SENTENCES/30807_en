TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament met on Thursday (February 10th) for the first time since the violent demonstrations of January 21st, and by the end, punches were flying.
Government and opposition lawmakers accused each other of responsibility in the deaths of four protestors and in causing the political crisis.
Opposition Socialist Party (SP) members flooded the podium after one of their members was refused the right to speak.
Moments later, a lawmaker from the majority was punched and the session ended.
The ruling Democratic Party (DP) filed a lawsuit against the aggressor.
The SP says it will not return to parliament and that their protests seeking snap elections will continue.

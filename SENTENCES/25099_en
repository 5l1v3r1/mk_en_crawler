ZAGREB, Croatia -- Voters went to the polls Sunday (December 27th) to elect their next president amid a deepening economic crisis and fears of growing corruption.
A dozen candidates are running to replace incumbent Stipe Mesic, whose second term ends in February.
Latest polls suggest a second round will be required on January 10th, as none of the candidates is expected to attract 50% of the votes Sunday.
Front runners are expected to include Ivo Josipovic, of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, and independent candidate Nadan Vidosevic.
Other contenders are fellow independent Milan Bandic and Andrija Hebrang, of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union.

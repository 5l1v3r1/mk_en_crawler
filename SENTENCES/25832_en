BUCHAREST, Romania -- Economy Minister Adrian Vidianu confirmed on Thursday (February 18th) that Russian energy giant Gazprom has invited Romania's Transgaz to join the South Stream project.
Gazprom Vice-President Alexander Medvedev arrived in the country Wednesday to discuss increasing joint natural gas extraction.
In addition, Gazprom is interested in building a natural gas storage facility, along with Romgaz, Romania's natural gas monopoly.
Gazprom also expressed a willingness to eliminate intermediaries in a potential future gas delivery agreement with Romania.
The current deal expires late next year.

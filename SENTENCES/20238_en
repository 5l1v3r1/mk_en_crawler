MADRID, Spain -- Albanian Minister of Integration Majlinda Bregu said her government hopes to join the EU by 2017.
In a speech to a European Commission meeting in Madrid on Wednesday (November 14th), she said Tirana must urgently implement several reforms in the judicial and electoral systems to meet a crucial condition for EU integration.
She added the government is committed to doing so as soon as possible.
In other news Wednesday, Albania's opposition Socialist Party (SP) announced it will change its working strategy in 2008.
Rather than quiet meetings regarding the environment, agriculture, and education, SP plans to hold open protests in main squares across the country, against the current government.

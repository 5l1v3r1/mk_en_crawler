PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government established a commission Thursday (March 27th) to handle border demarcation issues with Macedonia.
While Prime Minister Hashim Thaci noted that "finding a solution to the border issue helps the good relations between two countries", he said Skopje has never made its recognition of Kosovo conditional on the establishment of such a panel.
He expressed confidence that Macedonia will extend the recognition as soon as it decides on an appropriate time to do so.

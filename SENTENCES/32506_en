PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following the latest comments by Serbian and Albanian politicians, the fate of the proposed talks between Belgrade and Pristina hangs in the balance.
Local Kosovo Serb and Belgrade politicians said Tuesday (11 March) that they strongly oppose UNMIK chief Michael Steiner's proposal to transfer some authority from UNMIK to interim Kosovo institutions.
Return coalition presidency member Oliver Ivanovic and Belgrade's Kosovo co-ordinator, Nebojsa Covic, both say the idea paves the way towards independence.
In other news, customs officers in Kosovo destroyed 20 million knockoff cigarettes on Tuesday to highlight a campaign against smuggling and organised crime.
The cigarettes were labelled as Marlboros, but Philip Morris says it did not produce them.

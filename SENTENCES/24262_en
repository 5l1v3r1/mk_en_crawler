BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Turkey, Iraq and the United States agreed on Saturday (April 11th) to step up intelligence sharing to fight the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
The three countries established a special committee to exchange information and find effective ways to stop the PKK's political, military and media activities, said Iraqi National Security Minister Sirvan al Vaili. 
He spoke after a meeting held within the framework of the trilateral mechanism for fighting terrorism established last November. 
In a joint declaration, the three countries said they consider the PKK a terrorist organisation, whose activities harm both Turkey and Iraq. 
Iraqi authorities also announced a ban on activities by the PKK and its affiliate, the Kurdistan Democratic Solution Party. 
"We have decided to shut down everything that is related to PKK â¦ Our forces have the authority and the power to close PKK bases," al Vaili said.

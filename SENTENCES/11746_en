SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU Special Representative to Macedonia, Mihail Salin, has warned that a disorderly second round of local elections would have negative consequences for the country's EU membership prospects. 
In an interview with Radio Free Europe on Sunday (20 March), Salin said the EU was surprised and disappointed by the irregularities and violations registered in certain municipalities during the first round on 13 March. 
He called on all political forces to step up efforts to ensure a democratic and orderly run-off on 27 March.

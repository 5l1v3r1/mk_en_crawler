TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha briefed the Albanian media Sunday (February 10th) on his recent visit to Japan, saying he had strengthened bilateral relations.
Berisha said Japan plans to offer a 73m euro loan to Albania with almost no interest.
He also explained that discussions focused mainly on power generation, infrastructure, education and health.
At the same press conference Sunday, Berisha said he welcomed a meeting with Socialist Party leader Edi Rama.
They will discuss electoral reform at the SP's invitation, reforms that are key to Albania's NATO and EU bids.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council decided on Friday (June 15th) to extend the mandate of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus by six more months, until December 15th. 
The resolution, adopted unanimously, also called on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to resume reunification talks, as negotiations have been stalled for too long. 
The Security Council says it expects UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to present a report on the situation by December 1st.

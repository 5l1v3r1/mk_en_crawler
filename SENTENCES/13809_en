ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new draft law on security services, due to be discussed by the Croatian government this week, was the focus of talks Monday (20 March) among President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks.
The bill is expected to complete reform of the security services by merging the intelligence and counterintelligence agencies into a single structure.
Also Monday, the government presented a 97m-euro project to modernise the Ploce seaport, which represents the south end of the planned pan-European Corridor Vc.
International institutions would help finance the project.
In other news, the justice ministry announced on Monday that Australia has agreed to extradite former Serb militia commander Dragan Vasiljkovic, known as "Captain Dragan." Croatia has charged him with involvement in war crimes during the 1991-1995 conflict.
Media reports suggest the hand-over could occur in mid-April.

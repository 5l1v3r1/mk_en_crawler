BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities should continue their fight against organised crime groups, extremist groups and other organisations that attempt to disrupt public order or disturb the peace, the government concluded after its meeting Thursday (October 14th).
A statement issued by the cabinet adds that those who participated in recent rioting should be brought to justice.
It also commended the police for dealing in a professional manner with violence that erupted near Sunday's Gay Pride parade in Belgrade.
Authorities estimate that about 6,000 people clashed with 5,000 policemen.
More than 150 people were injured and there was significant property damage.
Despite that, the government says the overall security situation is stable.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country has been excluded from the visa regime liberalisation procedure involving EU candidates because it lags behind in the area of police reform, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said on Sunday (March 23rd). 
In an interview with the Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz, Frattini noted that BiH is the only Western Balkan country excluded from the process.
As for the situation in the Balkans since Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence in mid-February, Frattini said he sees risk of further tensions. 
"This is why additional military forces have been sent to Kosovo," he explained.

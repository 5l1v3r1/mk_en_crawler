BELGRADE, Serbia -- Four more defendants charged with helping war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic evade arrest pleaded not guilty, as the trial at the Belgrade Second Municipal Court continued on Tuesday (November 21st). 
Eleven in all have been charged. 
The four entering pleas Tuesday were brother and sister Bojan and Tatjana Vaskovic, Predrag Ristic and Borislav Ivanovic. 
Just as the court was to hear from a fifth defendant, former Yugoslav army officer Blagoja Govedarica, the session was interrupted to allow officials to determine if his testimony would threaten national security. 
The trial is set to resume next week.

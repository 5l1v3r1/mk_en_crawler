SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers adopted a memorandum of understanding Tuesday (10 June) with the United States regarding control of arms and military equipment. 
Ratification of the document is a prerequisite for implementing the US plan for military aid to BiH. 
The agreement aims to establish a more efficient system for control of cross-border arms traffic, arms trade deals signed with local entities, and export licensing for trade of military equipment. 
Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic will oversee implementation of the agreement.

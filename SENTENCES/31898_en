VLORE, Albania -- Leaders gathered Thursday (28 November) to celebrate Albania's national holiday. 
The event took place in Vlore, where Albania's independence was proclaimed in 1912. 
President Alfred Moisiu addressed the gathering, calling for reforms and determination in meeting what he described as the "huge challenges" that lie ahead - an apparent reference to bids for membership in NATO and the EU. 
Politicians from Kosovo and Macedonia were also on hand.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev announced on Thursday (March 6th) that three types of declarations related to conflicts of interest will have to be submitted by senior civil servants.
The first declaration, to be filed at the time of appointment, should define any circumstances that could create difficulties or conflicts of interest.
Civil servants would then have to submit annual declarations on conflicts of interest when associates or relatives participate in public tenders.
Lastly, senior officials will have to declare any specific conflicts of interests as they arise.
Stanishev explained that the measures are an attempt to ensure ethical behaviour.

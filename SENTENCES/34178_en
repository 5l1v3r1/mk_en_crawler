BUCHAREST, Romania -- A French delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, led by Jean-Claude Mignon, visited Bucharest on Thursday (10 July). 
The visit focused on co-operation between the two countries, and on mutual willingness to strengthen bilateral ties. 
The delegation reportedly assured officials that the French Parliament would ratify Romania's protocol for NATO accession by mid-October.
Also Thursday, representatives of the Romanian and German Interior Ministries sealed a protocol to modernise Romania's border police. 
Bucharest says the agreement would further expand Germany's logistical support for combating crime and illegal migration.

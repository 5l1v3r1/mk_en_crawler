PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Wednesday (January 23rd) that the province will declare independence very soon.
In an interview with the Kyodo news agency, Sejdiu said he hoped Japan would be among the first to recognise the country's independence.
Separately, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci arrived in Brussels Wednesday for two days of talks with senior EU and NATO officials.
He said he had informed Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, that Kosovo Albanians are awaiting final status with the support of the Union and the United States.
Thaci predicted there will be a broad acknowledgement of Kosovo's independence by world political powers.
Rupel described Kosovo's status as one of the most important issues Slovenia will face during its six-month EU presidency.

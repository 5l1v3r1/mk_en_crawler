ZAGREB, Croatia -- The chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal, Serge Brammertz, said on Friday (January 2nd) that "some people" in Croatia are intentionally concealing evidence against three Croatian generals, Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak. 
All three face indictment by The Hague for allegedly committing war crimes during the Croatian army offensive known as Operation Storm in 1995. 
We have reason to believe that someone is hiding key evidence, Brammertz said to the Zagreb daily Vecernji List. 
Hundreds of Serb civilians died during Operation Storm, which began on August 4th 1995 and ended with the elimination of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina.
In other news, Croatian police's anti-graft department charged 23 people, including nine professors, with corruption in the Zagreb University economics faculty, media reported Friday. 
The suspects allegedly took bribes from students in exchange for higher marks in exams.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan announced on Friday (25 July) that he has picked former Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri to head UNMIK. 
The post was vacated by Michael Steiner, who became Germany's representative to the UN in Geneva. 
Holkeri was a member of the team, led by US Senator George Mitchell, which negotiated the peace process in Northern Ireland. 
He is currently president of the Finnish National Commission for UNESCO.
On Saturday, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova issued a statement supporting the appointment and urging Holkeri to step up privatisation and the passage of laws promoting foreign investments in the province. 
Nebojsa Covic, the head of Serbia's Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo, called on Holkeri to strengthen co-operation between Belgrade and Pristina.
Meanwhile, three explosions rocked Kosovo late Friday into Saturday, but caused no casualties. 
Strong blasts occurred in Podujevo, Talinovac and in the Pristina suburb of Ulpiana.

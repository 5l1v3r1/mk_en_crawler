BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The foreign ministers of Croatia and Slovenia briefed EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday (May 27th) on their responses to his latest proposal for resolving their longstanding border dispute.
Rehn welcomed the commitment of both countries to assist with the process, said his spokeswoman, Krisztina Nagy.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said after the meeting that talks on the border issue would continue in the first half of June.
According to him, Rehn is willing to accept small changes to his proposal.
However Zbogar's Croatian counterpart, Gordan Jandrokovic, reiterated that Rehn's proposal is final and Zagreb would not accept any Slovenian changes.
Rehn's plan envisions the establishment of an ad hoc five-member international arbitration panel.
The maritime border dispute has slowed Croatia's EU membership bid.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Office (ICO) head Pieter Feith is convinced that there will soon be results in Kosovo's anti-corruption efforts. 
Speaking to the American University in Pristina on Tuesday (April 27th), he added that Kosovo must fight corruption if it wants a future in the EU. 
As for economic development, Feith noted international investors are largely avoiding Kosovo, opting for other countries in the region. 
He supports privatising the international airport, as well as holdings in the telecommunications and the energy sectors.

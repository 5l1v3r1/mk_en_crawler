BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu announced on Monday (22 August) that he is replacing four of his ministers, citing poor performance. 
The officials in charge of finance, European integration, economic affairs, and health care have been fired. 
Deputy Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu will replace his superior Ionut Popescu, who had differences with Tariceanu over government subsidies to state-owned firms. 
Anca Boagiu will take over the European Integration portfolio from Ene Dinga. 
Eugen Nicolaescu replaces Mircea Cinteza as health minister. 
The reshuffle followed scathing criticism of the cabinet's performance by President Traian Basescu, particularly over delays in reforms crucial to Romania's EU accession, planned for 2007.

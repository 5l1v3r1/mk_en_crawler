NEW YORK, United States -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri urged more serious dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina so progress can be achieved on key issues, such as clarifying the fate of over 3,500 missing persons. 
During Friday's (6 February) session of the UN Security Council, Holkeri described the situation in the province as fragile and marked by mistrust between the ethnic communities. 
Holkeri noted that local leaders in Pristina understand dialogue is an essential standard that must be fulfilled before resolving the status of Kosovo. 
But he criticised Belgrade for establishing parallel institutions and structures in the province. 
Holkeri referenced a paper issued in December titled "Standards for Kosovo", which outlined priorities to be achieved by Kosovo's interim administration before permanent status could be discussed.

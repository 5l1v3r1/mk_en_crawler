TIRANA, Albania -- Ratification of the EU Lisbon Treaty is not a guarantee for further EU enlargement, Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus said on Monday (October 5th) in Tirana after meeting his Albanian counterpart Bamir Topi. 
Responding to a question whether his country would ratify the treaty, Klaus only said that the Constitutional Court is going through it. 
However, he reiterated support to Albania's EU bid. 
Albania submitted its application for EU membership in April during the Czech presidency of the bloc. 
During his visit to Tirana, Klaus also held talks with local leaders on bilateral economic relations and Czech investments in the country.
Also on Monday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha praised the Irish "yes" to the Lisbon Treaty, saying that it encourages the Albanians and the government to continue reforms in order to reach EU integration standards.

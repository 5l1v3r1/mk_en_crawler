SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Tuesday (January 27th) that BiH is not functional and that its many unresolved issues prevent it from applying for EU membership.
In an interview with Reuters, Lajcak said the country should give up plans to apply for candidacy this year.
He will soon leave his post in BiH to become foreign minister of Slovakia.
He announced on Monday he will fulfil his duties as high representative until he has a successor.

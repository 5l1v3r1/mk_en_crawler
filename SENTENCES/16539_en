SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's right-wing opposition parties plan to submit a joint no-confidence motion against the coalition government this week, according to a statement Sunday (9 April) by Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) leader Petar Stoyanov.
He said all 50 deputies from UDF, the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria and the Bulgarian People's Alliance would support the request for a no-confidence vote against the cabinet.
Parliamentary regulations require at least 48 of the 240 parliament members to back such an initiative.
The right-wing opposition accuses the government of failing to respond quickly to recent flooding and of links to misappropriated funds, set aside for reconstruction work and flood prevention.

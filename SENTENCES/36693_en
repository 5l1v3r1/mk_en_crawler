TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialist Party (SP) says it is ready to talk with the opposition about a compromise on the controversial property bill.
Albanian Daily News reports Thursday (29 July) that SP parliamentary group deputy head Bardhyl Agasi has indicated that the party is open to compromise, but also willing to go ahead with a vote Thursday regardless of whether a consensus is achieved.
He said the opposition has given no indication it will change its stance, raising doubts common ground could be reached.

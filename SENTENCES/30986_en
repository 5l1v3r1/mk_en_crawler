SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Ministry spokesperson Vessela Cherneva confirmed on Tuesday (May 3rd) that 13 Bulgarian ambassadors have been recalled -- pending dismissal -- over their past service in the communist-era secret services. 
Another 22 ambassadors and permanent representatives will be recalled on June 1st, Cherneva added. 
The government decided to recall all ambassadors who had worked for the communist secret service after an investigative panel published in December the names of 192 diplomats with previous involvement. 
President Georgi Parvanov insists each case should be considered individually.

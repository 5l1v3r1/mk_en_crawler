ATHENS, Greece -- The Supreme Court announced Tuesday (1 June) that the DIKKI party will not be allowed to participate in the 13 June European Parliament elections.
The move comes after internal party disputes between DIKKI founder Dimitris Tsovolas and other party leaders.
After the March general elections, Tsovolas announced the disbanding of the party.
But the secretariat opposed his decision, leading to its currently unclear status.

MOSCOW, Russia -- The foreign ministry announced on Thursday (May 28th) that a bilateral agreement for visa-free travel between Russia and Serbia will take effect on June 10th.
The agreement, signed in February, will relieve visa restrictions for citizens of the two countries traveling with valid passports.
They will be able to enter and stay on the territory of the respective country for up to 30 days without a visa.
Nor will they need invitations or tourist vouchers to enter the other.

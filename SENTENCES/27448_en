ANKARA, Turkey -- Selaetin Demirtas, the co-leader of the biggest pro-Kurdish party in parliament, the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), received a suspended sentence of ten months in jail Tuesday (September 28th) for disseminating propaganda in favour of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
The case stems from a speech Demirtas made in 2006 on Roj TV, a Denmark-based, pro-Kurdish TV channel that has been accused of serving as a PKK mouthpiece.
The sentence has been suspended for five years and Demirtas will not have to serve it unless he repeats the same crime during this period.
The sentence is subject to appeal.
In other news Tuesday, Interior Minister Besir Atalay said he told General Lloyd Austin, commander of the US Forces in Iraq, that solid measures are necessary against the PKK in northern Iraq.
"We [discussed] further intervention by the United States and Turkey's expectations," Atalay told reporters after meeting with Austin in Ankara.
"One neighbouring country cannot harbour a terrorist organisation against another neighbour, which is also a provision of Iraq's constitution," he added.

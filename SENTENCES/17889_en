ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court sentenced Croatian businessman Hrvoje Petrac to six years in prison Monday (December 18th) for the 2004 abduction of a teenager for ransom.
Five other defendants received the same sentence.
This was a retrial, as the first verdict was overturned on technical grounds.
Petrac, believed to be a close aide to Croatian war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina, had been on the run for years but was arrested in Greece in 2005 and extradited to Croatia this past August.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Public sector employees will launch a general strike on October 5th against an IMF-recommended package of reforms that envision deep cuts in public spending on the public sector, union representatives announced on Thursday (September 10th).
About 800,000 teachers, policemen, doctors and public sector representatives are expected to participate in the strike.
Ahead of it, union members plan to picket outside parliament on September 15th.
In addition, unions are asking teachers to boycott Monday's opening of the new academic year and the first day of school.
Moreover, they say they will boycott the November 22nd presidential elections.
One contender, Social Democratic Party leader Mircea Geoana, plans to launch his campaign on September 27th with an extraordinary party congress, according to an announcement Wednesday by the honorary party president, Ion Iliescu.

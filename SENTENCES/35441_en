ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government presented its draft amendments to the criminal code on Thursday (15 April).
According to Justice Minister Vesna Skare Ozbolt, the legislation introduces new crime definitions, including international terrorism, human cloning and illegal construction.
It stipulates prison sentences of at least five years for crimes against humanity, and up to eight years for those convicted of command responsibility for such crimes.
Libel would also be classified as an offence instead of as a crime.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Six opposition parties in parliament plan to submit an official request for a no-confidence vote against the cabinet on Friday (4 February), according to statements from the opposition Wednesday.
The opposition cites the failed privatisation of the tobacco industry and the failure of the coalition government to implement set reforms.
Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Lidia Shuleva has been singled out for particular criticism.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Supreme Court Judge Ljubomir Vuckovic and Deputy Special Prosecutor for Organised Crime Milan Radovanovic have been arrested, according to a police statement Thursday (15 September). 
Radovanovic was detained for suspected violation of official secrecy, and Vuckovic on suspicion of accepting a bribe in relation to an appeals hearing over which he had presided. 
Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said other investigations against senior judges are ongoing.
In other news Thursday, Mirjana Markovic, wife of Slobodan Milosevic, failed to appear at the Belgrade district court to answer charges of abuse of authority. 
The international warrant against her had been withdrawn, after her lawyer guaranteed she would appear in court. 
She is charged with awarding luxury apartments to Milosevic's cronies as his war crimes trial in The Hague proceeded. 
The warrant against her has been re-activated.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Friday (26 November) that the cabinet will announce the date for the country's presidential elections on Tuesday.
He added that the date will most likely be 2 January 2005.
Also on Friday, the Croatian Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion which opposition parties had filed against Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul.
The parliamentary majority said corruption accusations against Zuzul were based on media rumours.
In other news, Slovenian Prime Minister-elect Janez Jansa told Sanader Friday that his government would back Croatia's bid for EU membership.
The previous cabinet in Ljubljana had threatened to block Zagreb's bid because of a territorial dispute over the Piran Bay.

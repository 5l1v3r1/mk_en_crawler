BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Senate's judicial committee passed an amendment Thursday (September 4th) to the law on appointing prosecutors, local media reported. 
Under the amendment, the president will no longer name the chief prosecutors in the Anti-Corruption Prosecution Office, the Organised Crime and Terrorism Investigations Department, and the Prosecution Office of the High Court of Justice. 
Instead, the Supreme Council of Magistrates would handle these nominations. 
The amendment also envisions that chief prosecutors and their deputies will be named only if they have been active as prosecutors or judges for at least ten years. 
The amendment moves next to the full senate for adoption.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Charge d'Affaires of the US Embassy in Sarajevo Jonathan Moore rejected on Monday (August 23rd) any parallels between Kosovo and the Republika Srpska (RS), insisting that as an entity of BiH, it has no right to secede.
Moore spoke to reporters in Banja Luka where he met with RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and leaders of two opposition parties -- Mladen Bosic of the Serbian Democratic Party and Mladen Ivanic of the Party of Democratic Progress.
The focus was the political and economic situation in the entity and the upcoming October 3rd general elections.

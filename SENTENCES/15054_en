PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Several hundred Kosovo Serbs staged a violent protest Thursday (1 December) after a drive-by shooting wounded a teenager in Gracanica.
The protesters stoned passing cars and injured six ethnic Albanians, a police spokesman said.
They also blocked the Pristina-Gjilane highway.
Dragomir Jovanovic, 17, was wounded on Wednesday when gunmen opened fire on him in the village of Susica.

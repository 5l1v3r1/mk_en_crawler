BELGRADE, Serbia -- A new round of talks among the parties in Serbia's democratic bloc, aimed at forming a new government, ended without concrete progress Tuesday (March 20th). 
The Democratic Party (DS), Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia (DSS-NS) coalition, and G17 Plus remain unable to strike a deal on the future prime minister-designate. 
DSS-NS rejects the DS nominee for the post, former Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic, insisting that DS could not hold both the presidency and the premiership.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In referendums Sunday (18 January), seven more municipalities rejected the government's recently proposed administrative division of the country. 
Results show that over 90 per cent of the population in all seven localities -- Zelenikovo, Bogomila, Zletovo, Dobrusevo, Konopiste, Staravina and Topolcani -- support the existing system. 
That makes 20 municipalities in all who oppose the government's plan for decentralisation as envisioned under the Ohrid Peace Accord.
In other news Monday, President Boris Trajkovski said he would appoint a new chief of the Macedonian Army general staff in February. 
General Metodi Stamboliski retires next month.

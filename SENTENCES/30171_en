BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday (April 14th) that Serbia and Montenegro are ready to make the next steps towards EU integration, provided they manage to finalise EU-related reforms by October. 
Speaking at a meeting of the EU and Western Balkans parliamentarians in Brussels, Barroso acknowledged that challenges remain in the region. 
He cited the need to register progress in the Belgrade-Pristina talks, overcoming the political impasses in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, and resolving the name dispute between Skopje and Athens. 
He also predicted that completing EU accession talks with Croatia would serve as an impetus for other countries.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In a press statement Friday (31 December), President Branko Crvenkovski said that last year's delays of economic reforms should be made up during 2005.
Acknowledging that the government's pledges of greater economic growth, reduced unemployment and higher standards of living had not been realised, Crvenkovski said the tasks are priorities for 2005.
In other news, the interior ministry says it submitted an arms bill to parliament late last week.
The measure would strengthen rules governing the possession and use of weapons by the public, including re-registering of all weapons.

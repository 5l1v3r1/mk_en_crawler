BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Sredoje Lukic has surrendered to Serbian authorities, government sources in Belgrade said Tuesday (13 September). 
Lukic, 44, has been in hiding for more than five years. 
The UN war crimes tribunal has charged him with being a member of a paramilitary group that tortured and killed Bosnian civilians, including more than 150 Muslims, in Visegrad. 
His cousin, Milan Lukic, was arrested in Argentina in August and is awaiting extradition to The Hague. 
Sredoje Lukic is expected to leave for The Hague on Wednesday, a government source told AFP. 
It is not clear where or when he was detained. 
Officials said the arrest was the result of co-operation between Serbian and Bosnian Serb security services.

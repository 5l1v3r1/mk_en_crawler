THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal decided on Friday (July 20th) to combine the war crimes trials of two Bosnian Serb cousins. 
Milan and Sredoje Lukic are charged in connection with the murders of 100 Muslims in Visegrad during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Last week, the UN court's appeals chamber overturned a decision to transfer Milan Lukic's trial to Sarajevo, citing the gravity of the offenses. 
In its latest ruling, the tribunal said the two cases are closely related factually, and involve many of the same witnesses and victims.
In other news Friday, The Hague tribunal refused to grant provisional release to former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, an ex-rebel commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
He requested release during the court's summer recess to visit his family, but prosecutors said there was a danger of witness intimidation. 
Haradinaj is charged with atrocities against Serbs and ethnic Albanians suspected of helping them.

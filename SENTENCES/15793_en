NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council voted on Tuesday (November 21st) to extend the EU-led military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for another year.
While welcoming "tangible signs" that BiH is moving closer to membership in the EU, the resolution adopted Tuesday said the country's peace agreement has not been completely implemented and that BiH must do more to ensure the return of refugees, more than a decade after the conflict.
The resolution also urged BiH to focus on reforming its fragmented police services, and reiterated the country's obligation to find and arrest war crimes suspects.
Tuesday was the 11th anniversary of the preliminary agreement of the Dayton Accords, which ended the bloody interethnic conflict in BiH.
Also Tuesday, the leaders of the main six parties held talks aimed at forming a parliamentary majority in the BiH House of Representatives.
Negotiations will continue.

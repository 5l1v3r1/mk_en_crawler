LITTLE ROCK, United States -- President George W Bush called his Turkish counterpart, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, from Air Force One on Monday (5 May), offering his condolences and US assistance to the victims of last week's earthquake in Bingol, which killed more than 170 people, including 83 children. 
Turkish authorities have launched a major investigation into the construction companies whose buildings collapsed during the quake. 
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told reporters that changes would be made to several laws, making it impossible for contractors to ignore safety regulations.
The US State Department, meanwhile, lifted a travel advisory for Turkey that was issued on 19 March, shortly before the start of the military operation in Iraq. 
US diplomats and family members who were pulled out of the country at that time have now been asked to return. 
On a related note, Turkey plans to reopen its embassy in Baghdad by the end of this week. 
It closed down on 26 February.

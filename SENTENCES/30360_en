ATHENS, Greece -- Three small explosions were reported on Sunday (January 16th) in separate districts of Athens, ahead of Monday's start of a trial for 13 suspected members of the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire extremist group.
Police say a makeshift explosive device planted at the entrance of a bank office caused some property damage and a fire which was quickly extinguished.
In the second incident, a bomb exploded in an office of the ruling PASOK party, which had been closed for ten days.
The blast broke windows.
In the third incident, several small devices exploded in the office of a construction company, causing damage, but again, no injuries.
Security has been tightened in Athens amid concerns that members of the terror group may try to stage attacks.

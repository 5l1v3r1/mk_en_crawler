ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Wednesday (18 January) that the country is prepared to settle all outstanding issues with Italy stemming from WWII, including the payment of a 28m-euro debt. 
After a traditional New Year's reception for representatives of the Croatian media, Mesic stressed that Zagreb wants to see this chapter closed. 
The financial liabilities fall under an agreement between Italy and the former Yugoslavia, of which Croatia is a successor. 
Mesic also criticised Italy for its unwillingness to compensate Croats whose property in Italy was destroyed or who were forced into Italian prisons without trials during the war.

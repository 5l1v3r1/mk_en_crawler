THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Friday (February 19th) rejected a request by Serb Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj to drop all charges against him and terminate war crimes proceedings, due to the alleged violation of his rights as a defendant. 
Seselj based his request on the "doctrine of the misuse of proceedings" in the Anglo-Saxon system, insisting the goal of the trial chamber is to keep him in custody as long as possible. 
The trial chamber says postponements were necessary only to secure a lawful trial and provide extra time to both sides to check important elements.
Seselj has been in custody since February 2003 for war crimes against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993. 
His trial began in September 2007 but was suspended in February 2009 after a witness claimed he received threats from Seselj. 
Proceedings resumed last month.

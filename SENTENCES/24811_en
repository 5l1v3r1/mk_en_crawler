SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops on Tuesday (December 2nd) raided the house of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's wife and questioned members of his family as part of efforts to locate war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic. 
The raid on Liljana Karadzic's house in Pale, about 20km east of Sarajevo, lasted for several hours, NATO spokesman Derek Chappell said. 
"We have reason to believe that Karadzic's and Mladic's networks overlap," Chappell explained, adding "it was a very worthwhile operation".
Separately Tuesday, the former president of The Hague war crimes tribunal, Fausto Pocar, said he hopes Serbia will soon locate and arrest Mladic. 
Addressing a conference on war crimes trials in Belgrade, Pocar said that even after 2011, when the tribunal is expected to close, Mladic could face trial at The Hague.

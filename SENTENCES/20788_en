SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a speech to parliament Thursday (September 6th), international community High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said politicians must choose whether to lead BiH to EU integration or towards global isolation. 
He reiterated that a failure to restructure the police would leave the country even further behind its regional peers on the path to EU membership. 
Lajcak added he would not hesitate to use his authority to finalise police reforms in order to meet an end of September deadline.
After the speech, the Bosniak member of the presidency, Haris Silajdzic, said he was disappointed that Lajcak did not name the Republika Srpska (RS) politicians viewed as directly responsible for the impasse in reforms. 
For his part, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik insisted police reform is not part of the Dayton Accord.

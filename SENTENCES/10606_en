THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The first trial of ethnic Albanian members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) is due to open on 15 November, a spokesman for the UN war crimes tribunal said Wednesday (13 October).
Fatmir Limaj, Haradin Bala and Isak Musliu are accused of "cruel treatment, torture, inhumane acts and murders" committed against Serb and ethnic Albanian civilians in 1998 at the Lapushnik KLA prison camp.
UN Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte says a new indictment against senior KLA members will be issued by the end of the year.
In other news, a panel of judges has scheduled a hearing for 21 October on the appeal by Slobodan Milosevic's lawyers against their appointment by the UN tribunal.
The two British barristers have complained that the defendant does not recognise them as legal counsel and that some of the witnesses refuse to testify before the court.

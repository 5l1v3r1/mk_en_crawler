BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade on Monday (November 1st) sentenced student Miladin Kovacevic to two years and three months in prison for inflicting severe bodily harm with possible deadly consequences to a fellow undergrad at a university he attended in the United States.
The sentence was delivered based on an agreement reached with prosecutors in September after Kovacevic pleaded guilty.
Bryan Steinhauer, 22, of Brooklyn, New York, sustained skull fractures and a severe brain injury during a fight with Kovacevic in May 2008.
Kovacevic was initially also accused of counterfeiting documents that allowed him to quickly leave the United States after the incident, but prosecutors have dropped that charge.

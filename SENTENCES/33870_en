THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal demanded additional information Friday (14 November) on Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic from Serbia-Montenegro authorities.
Tribunal Judge Ines Monica Weinberg de Roca issued an order to Belgrade to hand over the files.
Despite repeated requests, she said, Belgrade had so far provided only partial data on Mladic's service in the Yugoslav People's Army.
Serbia-Montenegro Minister for Human and Minority Rights Rasim Ljajic said Friday that the tribunal's request to open all state archives was impossible to meet.
Meanwhile, an article in Friday's <I>Vecernje Novositi</I>claimed Mladic left Serbia after narrowly escaping detention during a police operation on 22 October and is hiding in some other country.

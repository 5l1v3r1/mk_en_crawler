BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors pressed charges Monday (May 31st) against former Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, for abuse of office stemming from the so-called "satellite affair".
Tomo Zoric, a state public prosecutor's office spokesman, said that Davinic is accused of contracting to rent a spy satellite from an Israeli company at unfavourable rates.
Davinic signed the deal in 2005 when he was defence minister of Serbia and Montenegro, allegedly without consulting the government or the military.
He says he did nothing wrong.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign and EU Enlargement Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic has said prospects for starting accession talks with the EU are "deadlocked" over the issue of fugitive war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina, the New York Times reported Monday (28 February). 
EU ministers and senior officials have warned repeatedly in recent days that the talks, currently scheduled for March, will be delayed if he is not arrested.
On Monday, however, the German newspaper Tageszeitung quoted EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn as saying he favours launching the negotiations with Croatia on schedule. 
According to Rehn, the talks would send a very positive signal to other Western Balkan countries.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the nation Thursday (31 August) to explain government plans to send peacekeeping troops to Lebanon. 
He said Turkey has an historical and humanitarian duty to become involved in the Middle East. 
"By shutting down our doors, we cannot escape the fire," he said. 
Erdogan stressed that the troops would not be involved in combat operations, nor would they be asked to disarm Hezbollah. 
He added that the deployment would not drain resources from the fight against Kurdistan Workers Party terrorists.
In other news, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul plans to visit Greece in early October, part of the continuing effort to strengthen bilateral relations. 
The two governments adopted a set of confidence-building measures after a mid-air collision of Turkish and Greek fighter planes in May.

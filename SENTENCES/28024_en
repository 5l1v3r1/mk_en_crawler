ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Ivo Josipovic signed a decision on Thursday (August 19th) stripping convicted war criminal Branimir Glavas of his wartime medals.
Josipovic also announced he would strip Glavas's rank of major-general.
The move came after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for war crimes committed against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict.
In late July, his prison sentence was reduced from ten to eight years for 1991 war crimes committed against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek.
Glavas left Croatia for neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina to avoid serving the sentence.
Earlier this week, he lost his seat in Croatia's parliament.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski was arrested in Croatia on Tuesday (31 August) on a local prosecutor's warrant based on a judicial co-operation accord with Skopje. 
Macedonian authorities have accused him of ordering the March 2002 killing of six Pakistanis and an Indian who had entered the country in an attempt to immigrate to the West. 
At the time, Boskovski's ministry claimed the would-be immigrants were terrorists, allegedly in order to impress the West. 
Boskovski, who has dual citizenship, is due to be questioned by police and then appear before an investigating magistrate.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The federal Serbian-Montenegrin cabinet decided on Saturday (2 August) to form a council for EU integration. 
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said the cabinet agreed to meet at least once a month to gauge the progress achieved in bringing the loose union closer to EU integration. 
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said he is confident that federal and republican authorities have "confirmed that the EU is the main objective for both governments and for the Council of Ministers, and that everything is being done to achieve that goal as soon as possible."

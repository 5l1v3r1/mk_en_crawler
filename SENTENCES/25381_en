SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko delivered to Prime Minister Nikola Spiric an inventory Tuesday (December 22nd) of state property, completed by his Office of the High Representative (OHR).
Spiric, in turn, stressed the importance of striking an agreement among political leaders regarding the property issue in order to fulfil conditions necessary for the OHR to close.
In August, Inzko took over the inventory after a working group set up by Bosnian authorities failed to start the process.
Resolving the state property issue is one of five objectives set by the Peace Implementation Council to transition the OHR into the Office of the EU's Special Representative.

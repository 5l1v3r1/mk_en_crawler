PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Human rights in Kosovo have improved but more work is required from the institutions, according to Ombudsman Sami Kurteshi.
In an interview with Voice of America published on Sunday (January 2nd), Kurteshi said there are people who are above the law, not a good human rights situation.
Problems have spread throughout all administrative structures and often, the office of the People's Advocate is not respected at all, Kurteshi pointed out.
He said that complaints from the public involve mainly the courts, the government and the municipalities.

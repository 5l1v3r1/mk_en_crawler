ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ivo Sanader, leader of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), said at a press conference Monday (8 December) he would try to form the new government by the end of the year. 
Following consultations with President Stipe Mesic, Sanader added the parliament would most likely hold its constituent two-day session beginning on 22 December. 
After winning last month's general elections, HDZ has been working to secure support from other right and centrist-right parties in parliament.
In other news, Croatia's Tonino Picula will be attending this week's meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Brussels. 
He expects his counterparts to support the country's application to start EU accession negotiations early next year.

ATHENS, Greece -- The justice ministry says a prison inmate who has staged a hunger strike for 41 days was taken to hospital Wednesday (August 19th).
Theodore Iliopoulos, 31, launched the strike July 10th.
He was arrested on December 18th 2008 for allegedly throwing an explosive device during a demonstration against the police killing of a teenager earlier that month.
Though Iliopoulos denies the charges, his detention was extended for six more months on July 9th, prompting the hunger strike.

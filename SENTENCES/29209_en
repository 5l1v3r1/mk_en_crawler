STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Local prosecutors on Tuesday (October 5th) pressed charges against a Swedish citizen of Bosnian origin suspected of committing war crimes against Serbs during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
In 1992, Ahmet Makitan was a guard at the Dretelj Prison Camp in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where many Serbs were held. 
Makitan, who was member of a Croatian paramilitary group, obtained Swedish citizenship in 2006. 
Arrested in January of this year in northern Sweden, his trial is expected to begin next week.

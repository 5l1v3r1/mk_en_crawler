TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano says his ruling Socialist Party (SP) is committed to winning next year's general elections. 
Speaking at the 12th SP conference in Durres on Sunday (13 June), he said the party must change its structure and strategy to ensure continuity and to advance the reforms needed for European integration. 
These changes, he said, should ensure an SP victory. 
As for the major opposition Democratic Party, he predicted their preoccupation with "seizing power" would cost them the elections.

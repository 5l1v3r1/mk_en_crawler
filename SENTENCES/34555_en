ZAGREB, Croatia -- Florence Hartmann, spokeswoman for UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, has told the Zagreb daily <I>Jutarnji list </I>that unless fugitive General Ante Gotovina is arrested by 9 October, del Ponte's future report to the UN Security Council will mark Croatia's co-operation as incomplete.
Del Ponte insists the retired general is still in Croatia, prompting President Stipe Mesic to reiterate on Thursday (2 October) that local authorities do not know his whereabouts.
Also on Thursday, the government endorsed the completed European Commission (EC) questionnaire that will be delivered to EC President Romano Prodi next week.
The dossier includes answers to more than 4,500 questions and will serve as the basis for the EC's assessment of Croatia's readiness to join the EU.
In other news, the government decided Thursday to proclaim a fishing and environmental zone along the country's Adriatic coast.
The move was a compromise in the dispute with neighbouring Slovenia over Zagreb's plans to set up an exclusive Adriatic economic zone.

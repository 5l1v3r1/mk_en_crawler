BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is expected to adopt a recommendation Wednesday (May 26th) to lift the visa regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), but will stress that the two countries must meet more requirements. 
The recommendation will be announced this week by European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom. 
The recommendation moves next to the European Parliament for approval, followed by the EU Council of Interior Ministers. 
The interior ministers are expected to discuss the matter by the end of the year, when Belgium holds the rotating EU presidency.

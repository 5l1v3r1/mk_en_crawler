BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC), patriarch Pavle, was buried on Thursday (November19th) at the Rakovica monastery in a Belgrade suburb.
Several thousand from Serbia and neighbouring countries joined the funeral procession that passed through the centre of the Serbian capital.
The final liturgy was held in front of the St. Sava Temple and was led by Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.
"He was a true monk, a man of endless prayers, kind and calm but also a fighter who does not back down and is ready for any sacrifice when needed," he said.
Top clergy and dignitaries from Russia, Romania, Czech Republic, Albania and other countries attended the ceremony.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and members of the government also paid their last tributes to the patriarch.
Pavle passed away on Sunday at the age of 95, after spending two years at Belgrade's military hospital.

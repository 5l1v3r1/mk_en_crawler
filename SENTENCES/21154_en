BUCHAREST, Romania -- Catalin Predoiu was sworn in late Friday (February 29th) as Romania's new justice minister, ending a three-month political stalemate between Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu and President Traian Basescu. 
Predoiu, 39, a lawyer and a university professor, was nominated earlier on Friday. 
Wrangling between Tariceanu and Basescu has left Romania without a justice minister since December, when Tudor Chiuariu resigned amid a corruption investigation. 
Tariceanu's first choice for the job, Senator Norica Nicolai, was viewed by the president as unsuitable.

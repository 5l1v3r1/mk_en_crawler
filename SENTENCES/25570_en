SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Tuzla municipality filed criminal charges against Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik on Thursday (September 24th), for denying the massacres of civilians in Tuzla and Sarajevo during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
Dodik has said that the 1995 Serb mortar attack that killed 71 people in the northern town of Tuzla was staged.
He has also questioned the massacres at Sarajevo's main market in 1994 and 1995, when a total of 105 people were killed and 234 were wounded by Serb shells.
The Bosnian Serb leader made the provocative comments in June, after BiH's war crimes court sentenced Novak Djukic, a former Bosnian Serb army commander, to 25 years in prison for the shelling of Tuzla.
According to Tuzla municipality, Dodik's statements incite hatred and intolerance.

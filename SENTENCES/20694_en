SOFIA, Bulgaria -- By a wide margin Thursday (February 7th), the European People's Party (EPP) approved the membership application of the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), currently the most popular party in Bulgaria. 
Led informally by Boyko Borisov, GERB became the fifth Bulgarian party to join the EPP. 
All Bulgarian members supported GERB's entry except the Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria, which abstained from the vote. 
Afterwards, GERB chairman Tzvetan Tzvetanov said the party would proceed with efforts to unite Bulgaria's right-wing and change the status quo.

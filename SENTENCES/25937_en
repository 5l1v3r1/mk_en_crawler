ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police arrested Zeljko Sacic, a former close associate of war crimes indictee Mladen Markac, on Thursday (December 17th).
Police also say they are questioning 17 people in connection with the killing of five Serbian civilians in the village of Grubori in August 1995.
Some media reports suggest that Sacic, who was special police deputy commander at the time, was arrested for covering up the Grubori killings.
Markac, along with fellow Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Ivan Cermak, face trial at The Hague.

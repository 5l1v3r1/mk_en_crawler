DETROIT, United States -- Ethnic Serb Goran Pavic, who was arrested on the Canadian/US border on charges of committing war crimes in his home country of Croatia between 1991 and 1992, will remain jailed in the US until his hearing on December 4th, a Detroit court ruled on Tuesday (November 13th). 
Pavic was arrested last Wednesday after his name was found on an Interpol list of Serbs wanted for war crimes in Croatia. 
The US wants to extradite Pavic, but his lawyer says the case falls outside federal court jurisdiction. 
He also questions the validity of the extradition treaty.

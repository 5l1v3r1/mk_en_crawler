SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Hundreds of people gathered on Saturday (August 21st) to mark the 18th anniversary of the killing of over 200 Bosniaks from Prijedor, at Koricanske Stijene on Vlasic Mountain.
They threw white roses into the deep ravine where the 1992 killings took place.
Relatives criticised the slow process of identifying remains and searching for the missing.
They insist those responsible for the crime should face justice.
A total of 14 former Prijedor police officers have been charged -- four have admitted their guilt.

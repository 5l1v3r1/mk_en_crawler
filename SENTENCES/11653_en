BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting with Serbian President Boris Tadic in Brussels Monday (21 March), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the two generals indicted for war crimes -- Nebojsa Pavkovic and Sreten Lukic -- must be extradited to The Hague by the end of March.
Their transfer is the last obstacle to a positive EU Feasibility Study for Serbia-Montenegro, Rehn said.
On Monday, the federal council for co-operation with the war crimes tribunal decided to freeze the assets of indictees who do not surrender.
Council President Rasim Ljajic said that a related draft law would be submitted to the federal government by week's end.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government has drafted ten constitutional amendments to meet EU demands for democratic reform, local media reported Wednesday (28 April). 
If adopted, the amendments would abolish the state security tribunals, which deal with terrorism and extremism, and would give international treaties precedence over domestic law. 
The new provisions would delete all references to capital punishment and create a text that reads "men and women have equal rights." The package of changes was submitted to parliament late Tuesday. 
Still unclear is when lawmakers will debate them. 
All 198 deputies from the ruling Justice and Development Party have expressed support for the proposed amendments.

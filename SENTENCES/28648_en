TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling majority lost another seat in parliament Tuesday (October 12th), as Dritan Prifti, a member of the junior coalition ally Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), announced he is leaving the party and the coalition.
Prifti has been involved in a public squabble with SMI leader Ilir Meta over their political posts, which started with Prifti losing his job as energy minister in a government reshuffle last month.
Meta took over his post.
Prifti has said his dismissal was unwarranted and amounted to treason against him.
He also claimed that fellow party members had threatened his family.
Last month, two other parliament members quit their parties, one from the ruling Democratic Party and the other from the main opposition Socialist Party.

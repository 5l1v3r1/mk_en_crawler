SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Transport Minister Alexander Tsvetkov tendered his resignation during a regular cabinet meeting, local media reported on Wednesday (May 18th). 
The ministry cites personal reasons. 
Representatives of various opposition parties in parliament say the real reason is political pressure and an inability to cope with the situation in the indebted state railway company BDZ. 
It appears Tsvetkov will be replaced by Deputy Transport Minister Ivaylo Moskovski.

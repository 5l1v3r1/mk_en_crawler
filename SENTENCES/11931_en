BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission warned Croatia on Monday (17 January) that it must co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal in the search for fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina if it wants to launch accession talks with the EU on 17 March.
After a meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that he hoped Zagreb would double its efforts to establish full co-operation with the UN court.
Sanader in turn called on other nations to help in the search.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso also met with Sanader and said that Croatia had a real chance to join the EU by the end of the current commission's term in 2009.
He also stressed the need for war crimes co-operation.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) Constitutional Court concluded on Tuesday (April 20th) that a recently passed law on referendums does not violate the vital national interests of Bosniaks. 
Parliament passed it in February but Bosniak representatives in the RS Council of Peoples vetoed the legislation, insisting on more amendments. 
Constitutional Court President Mirko Zovko says the court rejected the Bosniak caucus's motion because they failed to mention exactly how the measure violates their interests.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Tuesday that the entity will likely organise a referendum on decisions imposed by the high representative before the October general elections.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative to BiH, Paddy Ashdown, said on Sunday (31 July) that the arrest or surrender of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic is crucial to the future of the Serb people.
More than any other development, apprehending the two top indictees would open up new possibilities for Serbs, BiH and the region, Ashdown said.
He also described the restructuring of the BiH police sector as the culmination of reforms in the past three years that have paved the way for BiH's integration in Euro-Atlantic structures.
Separately, British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft has repeated that if consensus for the BiH police reform is achieved by mid-September, BiH has every chance to begin Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU by the end of this year.
In an interview with Nezavisne novine on Sunday, Rycroft said the BiH parties are expected to reach an agreement, particularly on the thorny issue of mapping police regions.

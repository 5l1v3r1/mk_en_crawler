BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, who leads the junior coalition partner Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), said on Wednesday (April 20th) that if he were president, he would call early elections immediately. 
Dacic, however, stressed that political stability is highly important and agreed that any elections should be held after the European Commission announces its decision on Serbia's membership application. 
At the weekend, opposition leader Tomislav Nikolic launched a hunger strike demanding elections to be called for December. 
But President Boris Tadic refuses to call snap vote before Serbia receives EU candidate status. 
The next general elections are due in May 2012.

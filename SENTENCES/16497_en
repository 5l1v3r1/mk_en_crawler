DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader predicted an end to conflicts in Southeast Europe, once all countries of the region join NATO and the EU.
Addressing the Croatia Summit 2006 conference in Dubrovnik, Sanader said countries in the area have started to co-operate closely, helping each other in their progress towards membership in the major international alliances.
This in itself has already eliminated the threat of more regional wars, Sanader said.
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe President Rene van der Linden, meanwhile, said the EU must keep its promises to the Western Balkans regarding long-term membership prospects.

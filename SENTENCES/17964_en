BELGRADE, Serbia â The EU is ready to relaunch talks with Serbia on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement if Belgrade shows true commitment to co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Wednesday (May 16th).
He was the first official from Brussels to visit Belgrade since the election of a new reformist cabinet under Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Following a meeting with Rehn, President Boris Tadic said that he was unaware of the whereabouts of the top war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, but he pledged that everything will be done so that Serbia meets its international obligations.
Rehn also met with Kostunica, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, and the new deputy prime minister in charge of European integration, Bozidar Djelic.

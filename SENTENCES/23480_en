SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski won a slander lawsuit and 32,000 euros in damages Monday (December 22nd) from former Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski.
A court in Skopje ordered Frckovski to pay the damages for making allegations last year of Gruevski's involvement in a corruption case in 1999 when he was finance minister.
In 2007, Frckovski, now a university professor, published a comment in the daily Dnevnik on Gruevski's alleged involvement in the sale of the state oil refinery OKTA to Greece's Hellenic Petroleum.
Frckovski describes Monday's verdict as an "attack on free speech", saying he was just trying to "shed light on the role of various politicians in the sale of the refinery".

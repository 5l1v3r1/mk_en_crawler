TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian Orthodox Church issued a statement Tuesday (August 18th) criticising the proposed draft law on gay marriages.
The Synod of the Church said that marriage has always been between a man and a woman.
"Whenever there were experiments against the eternal laws of God, they led to human and social catastrophes," the statement warned.
Late last month, the government announced that it is considering the legalisation of gay marriage, based on a draft measure prepared by a Tirana NGO.

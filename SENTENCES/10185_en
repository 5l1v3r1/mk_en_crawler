ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic announced on Thursday (28 October) that the presidential election, previously scheduled for 21 December, would be held on 2 January. 
He said the government suggested the new date because it does not want to hold the vote on a weekday. 
Mesic, whose term expires in February, is running for re-election. 
Polls suggest he could win in the first round.
In other news, Judge Theodor Meron, the president of the UN war crimes tribunal, is to visit Croatia next week for meetings with Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and other officials. 
The talks will focus primarily on Zagreb's co-operation with the tribunal.

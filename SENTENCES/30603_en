ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (February 15th) rejected accusations from the far-right opposition Nationalist Action Party that he is using intimidation to silence critics ahead of the June general elections.
The allegations came after a court on Friday backed efforts to arrest or keep in custody over 160 people, including top generals and admirals, in relation to the so-called Sledgehammer case, a suspected plot to topple the government.
"This trial will answer all questions in the minds of people and strengthen the Turkish Armed Forces further," Erdogan told parliament, insisting that the country's judiciary is independent.

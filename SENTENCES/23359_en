THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal will organise a conference of war crimes prosecutors from countries in the former Yugoslavia late next week, Hague spokeswoman Olga Kavran announced on Sunday (March 29th).
The conference, financed by the European Commission, will bring together prosecutors from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia.
It is aimed at further boosting regional co-operation in issues related to war crimes.
"Strengthening co-operation between prosecution offices in the region remains a key moment for the continuation of the judicial procedures against war criminals from the countries from former Yugoslavia," Kavran said.

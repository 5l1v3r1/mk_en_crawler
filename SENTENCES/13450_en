ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police Monday (24 October) reportedly detained a man suspected of links with al-Qaeda and a failed plot to attack Israeli cruise ships in Turkey earlier this year.
According to local press reports, Salih Olcay's name and identity appeared on a forged identity card used by Syrian national Louai Sakra, who was apprehended for alleged al-Qaeda ties in August.
Olcay has told prosecutors that he lost his identity card two and a half years ago.

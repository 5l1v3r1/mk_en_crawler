BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Cypriot media quoted European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso as saying the reunification of Cyprus would constitute a "historic, important step", which would be in the interest of Cyprus, Europe and Turkey.
Speaking Monday (January 19th) at a joint press conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Barroso underscored the importance of Turkey's support for ongoing reunification talks in Cyprus.
On Tuesday, Erdogan said the Greek Cypriot administration deceived the EU when it rejected a UN reunification plan for Cyprus in 2004, media reported.
He accused Greek Cypriots of leaving the Turkish Cypriots out of the EU by rejecting the plan drafted by then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
"Unfortunately, after the referendum [on the UN plan], only the southern [Greek] part of Cyprus became an EU member," Erdogan told a meeting organised on Monday by a Brussels-based think tank, Friends of Europe.

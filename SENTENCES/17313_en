BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government endorsed an initiative Friday (May 25th) to open new negotiations on Kosovo's future status and forwarded it to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Belgrade is proposing new talks since the previous ones, which took place from February 2006 to March 2007, failed to result in a proposal acceptable to both sides.
Kosovo's status was a major topic of a three-day summit of presidents from 18 Central and Southeast European states held in Brno, the Czech Republic.
After it ended on Saturday, Czech President Vaclav Klaus said the unresolved status represents the biggest challenge facing the region.
Serbian President Boris Tadic agreed and vowed that Belgrade would not and could not give up its territory, just as it would not give up its European future.
Separately, Austrian President Heinz Fischer told the Vienna media that the Kosovo issue should be resolved at the UN.
He voiced support for former envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, calling it the best basis for a final decision.

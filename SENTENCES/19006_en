SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Regoje said on Sunday (December 3rd) that the BiH government had no official information about an alleged anti-terror police action in northern Italy involving BiH citizens.
A spate of reports in the BiH, Italian and Macedonian press late last week alleged that Italian police smashed a ring of BiH and Macedonian citizens suspected of links to al-Qaeda.
BiH Security Minister Barisa Colak also said on Sunday that Sarajevo had not been formally notified of the case.

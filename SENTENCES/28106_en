TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran signed a nuclear swap deal Monday (May 17th) after three days of mediation involving Turkey and Brazil.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry announced that the country will send 1,200kg of low-enriched uranium to Turkey, in exchange for 120kg of more highly enriched uranium within a year.
The 20% purity level is well below that used to produce nuclear weapons, serving instead as nuclear fuel for a research reactor.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu says the swap shows Tehran "wants to open a constructive path ...
there is no more ground for new sanctions and pressures" from the international community.
Turkey has been a long-time mediator between the West and Iran, insisting on diplomacy instead of sanctions.

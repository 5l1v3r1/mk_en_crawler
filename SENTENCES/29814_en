SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) returned to parliament Monday (March 28th) after a 20-month boycott.
DPA representative Imer Aliu says party lawmakers will only participate in the work of commissions dealing with election laws, in order to speed up parliament's dissolution and the calling of early elections.
Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanoski hailed the DPA's move and called on the other opposition parties to end their boycotts.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Heavy snow, ice and freezing temperatures paralysed the Balkans on Sunday (December 20th). 
Around 50 drivers near Pozarevac, in eastern Serbia, remained stuck on the road amid heavy snow. 
The northern province of Vojvodina is also covered by snow, causing chaos on the roads. 
There are big traffic jams in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Many roads in Montenegro were closed because of the snow, and travel is treacherous due to ice. 
There are also problems in Greece, Romania and Bulgaria.
In Croatia, rail service between Zagreb and Split was stopped for several hours on Sunday due to weather. 
Early Monday, at least 60 passengers were injured when a train failed to stop and hit a buffer at Zagreb's main railway station. 
The train, arriving from the town of Sisak, was carrying more that 100 commuters.

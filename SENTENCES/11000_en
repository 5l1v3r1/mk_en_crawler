BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The chief of Slobodan Milosevic's security service, Radomir Markovic, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday (29 June) for the attempted murder of Vuk Draskovic in October 1999. 
Three members of a police squad known as the Red Berets received 15-year terms for the same attack, which claimed the lives of four Draskovic associates. 
Among those sentenced was Berets chief Milorad Lukovic, also known as "Legija", who is also on trial for the 2003 murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Draskovic reacted angrily to the sentences, saying 10 and 15 years behind bars for four murders gives the underworld a license to kill. 
Prosecutors had sought 40-year sentences.

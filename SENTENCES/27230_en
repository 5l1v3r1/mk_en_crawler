BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (February 3rd) backed Greece's austerity plan, giving the country until the end of 2012 to get control of its huge budget deficit.
The Commission said Greece should present an interim progress report in mid-March.
Athens has promised that by the end of 2012 it will lower its budget deficit from the current 13% of GDP to the EU-set ceiling of 3%.
"The Commission recommends ...
that Greece [increase] the effectiveness of the public administration, stepping up pension and health care reform, improving labour market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system," the EC said.
The prospect of pay cuts prompted Greece's customs officials and tax collectors to stage a walk-out Thursday.
The BBC notes that part of the government's plan relies on tax collectors recovering billions of euros lost to tax evasion.
More anti-austerity strikes are on the way.
The main labour union GSEE said it will stage a 24-hour walkout on February 10th.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Macedonian Justice Minister Meri Mladenovska-Gjorgjievska said on Thursday (16 February) that the takeover of four cases from the UN war crimes tribunal would begin by year's end.
The minister said she and chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte agreed during a meeting in The Hague that the cases, which stem from the 2001 interethnic conflict, would be separately returned to Macedonia for processing by the judiciary.
But former National Liberation Army commander Ali Ahmeti, who leads the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), insists a written deal struck in 2001 prevents prosecution by Macedonian courts.
DUI is a junior partner in the coalition cabinet.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The deputy head of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Tomislav Nikolic, says his party has proposed a technical government to the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). 
He said Thursday (22 January) that the joint technical cabinet would fulfill its duties until new general elections are called. 
DSS has rejected the proposal, according to DSS deputy head Dragan Marsicanin. 
SRS, winner of last month's general elections, was pushed to call for new elections, fearing that the democratic parties could form a cabinet after all.
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party (DS) has virtually conditioned its support for the democratic government on being given the post of Serbian parliament speaker. 
Marsicanin however also rejected that idea, so the chances of forming a government that would include DS now appear slim.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A new letter was sent late Tuesday (November 3rd) to civilian prosecutors investigating a group within the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) that allegedly planned a coup against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
TV channels reported the development as breaking news. 
For the second time, the same unnamed TSK member who sent the first letter two weeks ago provided further information about the group within the TSK and their illegal operations. 
The source says activities within the armed forces were not limited to Colonel Dursun Cicek, whose signature appears on documents, but directly involved high-ranking army members. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the army to co-operate with the investigation. 
"If there are suspects there, they must be exposed and they must be handed over to justice," he said.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The chamber of deputies endorsed a bill on a majority-voting system Tuesday (March 4th), which means parliament members, senators and chairmen of county councils are to be elected by a single vote in one round of voting.
The electoral threshold was kept at 5%, despite opposition from the Hungarian Democratic Union.
Independent candidates would need the support of at least 4% of the total number of voters in their constituency.
The measure moves next to the president for signing.

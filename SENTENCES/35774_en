SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The political directors of the Peace Implementation Council's (PIC) Steering Board issued a joint declaration in Sarajevo on Thursday (1 April).
The document calls on BiH to speed up reforms in order to successfully complete the process of Euro-Atlantic integration.
During the meeting, led by High Representative Paddy Ashdown, the PIC directors noted that while the BiH authorities achieved progress in a number of essential areas, implementation of other core reforms has been delayed and even jeopardised by politics.
In particular, the international community expects BiH to establish a functional Indirect Taxation Authority and ensure single VAT introduction in mid-2005, as well as to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.

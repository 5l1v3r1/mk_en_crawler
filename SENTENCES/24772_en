BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) and the Social Democratic Party (PSD) have been holding initial talks on forming a coalition government, Mediafax and AFP reported on Wednesday (December 3rd), citing party officials. 
"We think a coalition with the PDL would be the best option. 
In this context of crisis, we need to have as soon as possible a government with a solid majority," PSD deputy leader Ilie Sarbu said. 
Before Sunday's parliamentary elections, the Liberals and the Social Democrats agreed on a coalition cabinet to include the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. 
Still unclear, however, is who would serve as prime minister, as both the PDL and the PSD insist on naming their own leader.

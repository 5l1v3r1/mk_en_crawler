ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Supreme Court on Saturday (July 31st) reduced the sentence of former parliament member Vladimir Glavas from ten to eight years. 
In May 2009, he was sentenced to ten years in prison for war crimes against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek in 1991. 
Soon after his conviction, Glavas fled to neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Both the prosecution and the defence appealed the sentence: the former arguing ten years is too short, the latter arguing it is too long.
On Saturday, the court also reduced the sentences of Glavas' co-defendants Ivica Krnjak and Gordana Getos-Magdic from eight to seven and from seven to five years respectively.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Neo-Nazi leader Goran Davidovic was extradited from Germany to Serbia on Thursday (April 29th) and immediately taken to prison to serve a one-year sentence for inciting national, ethnic and religious hatred.
Davidovic, also known as the "Fuhrer", was convicted in connection with an attack against participants of an anti-Fascist meeting in 2005.
He was arrested in Germany in early February based on an international arrest warrant.
Davidovic is also awaiting trial in Novi Sad for a similar attack in 2007.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) will conduct its own assessment in October of how Romania has complied with commitments as part of a recent financing agreement, before paying out the second tranche of a 5 billion-euro loan, the EC said in a statement Tuesday (August 11th).
The first tranche, totalling 1.5 billion euros, was paid out in July.
The problem is the ballooning budget deficit.
The current evaluation by the IMF and the Romanian government puts the reviewed target budget deficit at 7.3% of GDP in 2009, versus 4.6% at the start of the programme.
For 2010, additional measures were agreed on to reduce the deficit, including cutting salaries in the public sector and slashing spending on goods and services.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Gheorghe Pogea announced on Tuesday that all public sector employees must take ten days of unpaid leave by the end of this year, or combine unpaid leave with reduced working hours.
Any overtime will be compensated with time off, rather than overtime pay, Pogea added.

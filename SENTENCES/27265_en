PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic met on Monday (February 1st) with members of an IMF delegation before their visit ended Tuesday. 
The experts will write a report detailing a possible arrangement with the financial institution. 
The document is expected to be adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF within two months. 
The experts say the persistent problem of low liquidity around the globe could affect Montenegro and its banking sector. 
They urged Djukanovic to improve the business climate, invest in infrastructure and amend certain laws that obstruct the inflow of foreign investment.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Friday (25 April), the Office of the High Representative, the OSCE and the Council of Europe welcomed the determination shown by BiH authorities to sign the Bologna Declaration, bringing the country's higher educational sector into line with European standards. 
Earlier that day, the entity education ministers -- the Federation of BiH's Zijad Pasic and Republika Srpska's Gojko Savanovic -- signed a joint letter to the Greek Presidency of the EU that would be sent together with reviews of achievements and plans based on the Bologna Declaration objectives. 
Signing the declaration is intended to help increase students' mobility both within BiH and abroad, lead to easier recognition of qualifications and improve the quality of degree programmes.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- One person was killed and four were injured in an explosion and fire in an oil tank in the port of Constanta on Thursday (17 July). 
Officials say a stray spark triggered the blast aboard the 5,000-tonne tanker, which contained hydrocarbon waste, as it was being cleaned and repaired. 
It would have been disastrous to both the port and city of Constanta if firefighters had been unable to contain the blaze, they added.

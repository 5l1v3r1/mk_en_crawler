SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of war veterans and disabled people rallied in Sarajevo on Thursday (June18th) against a planned cut in their pensions. 
The protestors clashed with police while trying to enter the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) government building. 
Two people were slightly injured. 
The protest ended after FBiH government officials and IMF representatives struck a deal with the demonstrators. 
The FBiH government had planned a 10% cut in veterans' funding in order to secure an IMF loan but gave up the plan after the protest.
In other news Thursday, FBiH President Borjana Kristo and vice-presidents Mirsad Kebo and Spomenka Micic nominated Mustafa Mujezinovic as prime minister. 
The entity's parliament must confirm the nomination. 
Outgoing Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic resigned last month after being charged with misappropriation, stemming from a real estate deal in 2000.

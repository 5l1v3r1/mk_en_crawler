SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliamentary Speaker Georgi Pirinski announced on Friday (29 September) that one of the Bulgarian observers at the European Parliament (EP), Dimitar Stoyanov from the ultranationalist Attack coalition, might be withdrawn for allegedly insulting Hungarian Roma EP deputy, Livia Jaroka.
The Bulgarian parliament's ethics commission plans to review the case Monday, ahead of a vote by the full legislature later in the week.
Attack says the matter is an attempt to discredit the party ahead of the 22 October presidential election.

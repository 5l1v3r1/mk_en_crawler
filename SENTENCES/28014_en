PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU representative for northern Kosovo, Italian Ambassador Michael Giffoni, said on Wednesday (April 21st) that the EU will not recognise structures resulting from municipal elections organised by Serbia.
"These elections cannot be considered legal in Kosovo and this should be clear.
Of course, we are against everything that supports actions of some illegal structures," Giffoni said.
The Serbian Election Commission has published three lists ahead of the May 30th municipal elections in the northern Serb-dominated part of Mitrovica.

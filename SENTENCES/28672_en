ZAGREB, Croatia â The Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) decided on Saturday (July 10th) to leave the ruling coalition led by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
After a party meeting, HSLS leader Darinko Kosor told journalists it was because his party was unhappy with the government's work. 
He dismissed media allegations that the HSLS will now join the opposition coalition led by the Social Democratic Party. 
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said her government has enough support in parliament even without the two HSLS lawmakers, and said there will be no early elections.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than 5,000 army retirees marched in Bucharest on Monday (January 24th) to protest the government-imposed pension cuts.
The march coincided with celebrations marking the 1859 unification of Moldavia and Wallachia to form Romania.
Protestors chanted slogans "Down with the Pirate", referring to President Traian Basescu, who once worked as a sailor, and "Down with Elena" referring to Tourism Minister Elena Udrea.
Earlier in the day, hundreds of people booed Basescu, Udrea and Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi in the eastern city of Iasi, which borders Moldova.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu predicted on Thursday (May 3rd) that Kosovo will be independent despite Russia's opposition at the UN Security Council (UNSC).
"Even if a member of the UNSC uses the veto against Martti Ahtisaari's plan, Kosovo will still gain independence, which will be supported by the international community," Sejdiu said during a visit to the western town of Istok.
The Security Council is expected to discuss a resolution on the future of Kosovo this month or next.
Also Thursday, German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung arrived in Kosovo to inspect German peacekeepers deployed with KFOR.
He said the peacekeepers are committed to maintaining security in the province as it awaits the decision on final status.

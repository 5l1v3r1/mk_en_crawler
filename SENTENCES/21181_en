TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha criticised on Tuesday (July 31st) Albanian institutions that deal with the country's EU integration, accusing them of providing inaccurate information to Brussels, failure to implement EU directives, and inefficiency.
In particular, Berisha accused the Ministry of Integration of sending "sugar-coated" reports to the European Commission.
In other news Tuesday, Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha telephoned Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov to discuss a flap over weapons sales to Armenia.
Basha assured Mammadyarov that the Albanian government is investigating the incident and is taking necessary precautions against such sales.

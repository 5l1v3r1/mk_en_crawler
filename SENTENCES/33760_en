BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian President Ion Iliescu validated the appointments of Alexandru Farcas as minister of EU integration and Ovidiu Branzan as health minister on Thursday (27 November), and the two were officially sworn in at the Cotroceni Palace. 
The ruling Social Democratic Party named the two to fill positions left vacant after their predecessors became entangled in corruption and plagiarism scandals.
In other news, Dumitru Sorescu was appointed as head of the Romanian Police's Inspectorate General Thursday. 
Sorescu succeeds Florin Sandu, who recently assumed the position of state secretary at the interior ministry.

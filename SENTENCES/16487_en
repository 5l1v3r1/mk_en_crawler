TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu has appointed Major General Luan Hoxha as the new chief of the army's general staff, according to a statement Tuesday (October 10th).
Hoxha, 42, the deputy head of the military staff, succeeds General Pellumb Qazimi, whose second three-year term is ending.
Also on Tuesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha urged parliament to declassify the archives of the former Communist-era intelligence service Sigurimi.
The opposition Socialist Party says it would support opening the files.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Administrative Court rejected an appeal Wednesday (15 June) filed by opposition parties against the government's plan for election spending. 
According to the magistrates, cabinet decrees about the allocation of budget financing ahead of the 25 June parliamentary vote complied with administrative regulations and elections legislation. 
The Court also rejected the opposition's objection to the so-called election "lottery" -- a government incentive for encouraging voter turnout -- saying the initiative is legal.

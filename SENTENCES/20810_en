THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Bosnian Serb war crimes indictee Zdravko Tolimir's health is deteriorating because he is refusing to take prescription medicines for high blood pressure and a brain aneurism, the UN war crimes tribunal announced on Friday (October 5th). 
Tolimir is accused of genocide and other crimes stemming from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
Officials say that since his transfer to The Hague detention centre on June 1st, the former Bosnian Serb commander has refused to co-operate with doctors. 
Tolimir has also declared plans to act as his own lawyer in his trial, potentially complicating his health further.
In other news, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who is charged with crimes against Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s, told the tribunal Friday that he will not apply to be temporarily released for his mother's funeral Monday in Belgrade.

ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry announced on Wednesday (January 7th) that Greece has lodged an official complaint with Turkey over a search-and-rescue mission in the Aegean Sea that allegedly suffered harassment by Turkish jets. 
In a statement, the foreign ministry criticised the incident as "unacceptable" and warned it would notify NATO and the EU about it. 
The Turkish foreign ministry had no comment on Greece's statement. 
According to Greek military officials, Turkish fighters buzzed an army helicopter Wednesday as it searched for missing illegal immigrants in the Aegean.

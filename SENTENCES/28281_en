ATHENS, Greece -- The police said on Friday (June 18th) that a rocket-propelled grenade launcher found in a suspected hideout of a local radical group was used in an attack against the US Embassy in Athens three years ago. 
Far-right group Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility for the January 2007 attack, which caused minor material damage and no casualties. 
Six members of the group were arrested in an operation in Athens in April, and were charged with terrorism and attempted murder.

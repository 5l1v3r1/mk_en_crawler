SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors questioned Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov on Friday (January 5th), in relation to a probe against Valentin Dimitrov, head of the Sofia heating utility.
He has been in custody for several months, charged with tax evasion, misappropriation and money laundering.
Prosecutor Bozhidar Dzhambazov says the questioning of Ovcharov is related to a letter Dimitrov allegedly sent to a number of people for help, including someone referred to as "R.
Ovch".
Ovcharov has described the letter as a deliberate attempt to discredit him.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU external relations chief Chris Patten says it is up to Serbia-Montenegro's leaders to determine how quickly and deeply the integration process runs. 
In an interview with the Belgrade daily Politika on Sunday (13 June), Patten said the county has an open invitation to join the EU but must demonstrate whether it has the will to speed up the process. 
"I wish I could approve a positive Feasibility Study, recommending that Serbia-Montenegro move on to the next phase of its relations with the EU, that is to start talks on association. 
I cannot do that before we see that it had been agreed and realised," Patten said, referring to the feasibility study on the country's progress towards meeting the criteria for opening association talks.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several men armed with AK-47 assault rifles broke into a cargo area at the international airport in Sarajevo and stole the equivalent of 1.3m euros in cash Wednesday (December 5th). 
The money belonged to ABS Bank, a member of the Austrian Erste Bank Group, and was about to be loaded on a plane to Vienna. 
The robbers, who wore police uniforms and masks, held a police guard and staff members at gunpoint while they loaded the cash into a vehicle. 
The car was later found abandoned and burned.

NEW YORK, United States -- Macedonia is ready to lead intensive and constructive dialogue to find a mutually acceptable solution to its name dispute with Greece, Macedonia's representative in the talks, Zoran Jolevski, said at a meeting with UN envoy Matthew Nimetz in New York on Friday (November 13th). 
Jolevski expressed hope that Greece will observe a 1995 interim agreement and will not stand in the way of Skopje's EU bid. 
He said that abiding by this agreement would create a good atmosphere for resolving the dispute. 
Nimetz briefed Jolevski of Greece's position on the issue and promised to continue contacts between the two countries. 
Greece's representative in the talks, Adamantios Vassilakis, met with Nimetz on Thursday, reiterating that without resolving the name dispute, Macedonia cannot start EU accession talks.

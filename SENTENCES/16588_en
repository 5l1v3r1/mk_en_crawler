BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Friday (10 November) that he has formally signed a decree calling for parliamentary elections to be held on January 21st.
The move follows an agreement reached Thursday by the country's political parties.
Under the deal, the legislative elections would be followed in May by presidential elections.
The decision came after a month of negotiations.
Pro-democracy parties had wanted the vote to take place before the end of December, while the Radical Party and the Socialists pushed for a later date.
Also Thursday, parliament acknowledged the resignations of Deputy Prime Minister Ivana Dulic-Markovic, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, Agriculture Minister Goran Zivkov and Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic.
The four G17 Plus members -- who tendered their resignations on September 31st -- said the standstill on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations was the reason for their resignations.

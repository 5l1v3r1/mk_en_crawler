STRASBOURG, France -- Serbia on Friday (May 11th) assumed the rotating presidency of the Council of Europe (CoE) Committee of Ministers, which the Balkan state would chair for six months.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said his country was committed to the idea of Europe without wars and borders.
He said Serbia's chairmanship would focus on promoting CoE values in Southeast Europe and combating terrorism and organised crime.
In related news, Draskovic and CoE Secretary General Terry Davis, at a joint news conference Friday, rejected the possibility of a unilateral recognition of Kosovo's independence as a solution to the province's status.
They stressed that only the UN Security Council could decide on the issue.

Croatian handball team is much lauded, with two Olympic gold medals to its credit. 
Long elusive was the European championship. 
With a loss to France in Vienna on Sunday (January 31st), it remains so.
In the final round, the Croatian "Cowboys" -- led by 31-year-old veteran Ivano Balic -- lost to fellow handball superpower France, 25-21.
"This is a victory of an idea and a victory of the vision," said team coach Lino Cervar after the loss. 
"We have managed to make a synergy between older and younger players that will be ready to get the gold at the London Olympics."
The "Cowboys", as they are nicknamed by their fans, played tough but the French team was better in the closing minutes. 
More than 150 fans waited in bitter cold and snow to greet the team at the Zagreb airport Monday.
"I think I lost 5kg during the game jumping and cheering. 
Now I am exhausted. 
I am so sorry we lost," said Franjo Alajbeg, a Croatian living in Germany who traveled to Vienna to watch the game at Stadthalle.
Ivan Filipovic, who arrived from Zagreb, said "We should have kept the momentum [going]. 
France is a great team, but so are we."
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor watched from VIP seats in Stadthalle, wearing a team t-shirt.
The Croatian handball squad is the top team in the nation. 
In addition to the Olympic gold, it won a world championship in 2003 as well as many silver and bronze awards at the European finals.
While their coach was pleased with the heart his team showed -- "courage and talent", in the words of team captain Igor Vori -- the players wanted more.
Said goalkeeper Mirko Alilovic, who had a spectacular game, "I am so sorry that we did not win."

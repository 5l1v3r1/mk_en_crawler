ZAGREB, Croatia -- Deputy Interior Minister Stipe Cacija said Sunday (25 January) he would leave his post if requested by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
The move followed a report in the daily <I>Slobodna Dalmacija</I> accusing Cacija of failing to pay alimony for his 18-year-old son, despite a court order.
Cacija reportedly did not wish to acknowledge his parental obligations for the impoverished son.

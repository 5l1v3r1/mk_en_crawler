BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Sunday (December 31st) that his country's top priority is formal recognition as a candidate for EU membership. 
To achieve candidate status by the end of 2007, Serbia must prove to the international community that it is co-operating fully with the UN war crimes tribunal and pursue economic reforms, Tadic said. 
He added that the new year would be full of challenges, as the future of Kosovo is yet to be decided and Belgrade must either arrest war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic or prove he is not in the country. 
Tadic's Democratic Party (DP) has promised to track down the former Bosnian Serb commander if it comes to power in the January 21st parliamentary elections. 
In other news, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica spent New Year's Eve in the Serb-populated northern part of Mitrovica in Kosovo. 
Amid tight security, Kostunica visited with a local Serb returnee family before addressing several hundred local residents, who gathered after midnight at a central square.

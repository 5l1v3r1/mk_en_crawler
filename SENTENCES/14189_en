BRUSSELS, Belgium -- For the third time this month, EU member-states failed to agree on a statement Wednesday (14 September) in response to Turkey's refusal to recognise Cyprus.
The ambassadors of the European states meet again in a week to discuss the issue.
According to the French newspaper Le Figaro, if next week's discussions are fruitless, the EU foreign ministers might convene for a special meeting on 26 September A spokesman for the British Presidency of the EU said the dispute should not prevent the launching of accession talks with Ankara on 3 October.
Also Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the EU for what he described as diplomatic misconduct and an attempt to change conditions for his country's integration at the last minute.
Erdogan repeated that Ankara worked hard to meet set criteria for launching membership talks.

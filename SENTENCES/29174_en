PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police arrested on Sunday (September 5th) fugitive Lirim Jakupi, who escaped from a Kosovo prison three years ago.
Jakupi, nicknamed "Commander Nazi", was convicted in connection with several attacks on security forces in Macedonia and Serbia.
Police found two hand grenades, an AK-47 and two pistols while searching his house.
Jakupi escaped along with six other dangerous convicts in August 2007.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) parliament passed a bill Wednesday (March 17th) that calls for a population census to be conducted in 2011.
The questionnaire will contain a section on citizenship, mother tongue, nationality and religion, though by law, no one is obligated to declare their nationality or religion.
Bosniak members of parliament opposed the bill.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN special envoy for the Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari and representatives of the six-nation Contact Group are expected to meet in Vienna on January 26th, Ahtisaari's spokesman Remi Dourlot said Saturday (January 20th).
According to the BBC, Ahtisaari will present his proposal for Kosovo's future status at the meeting, which might also determine a framework for a new round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina.
On Friday, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu reiterated his belief that Ahtisaari's proposal will provide "a clear formula for Kosovo's future", paving the way for the province's independence.
In other news, a US platoon moved to Leposavic, close to the border with Serbia.
The move was part of a NATO plan to strengthen security for Kosovo's 100,000 Serb residents.
KFOR has signaled that it would not tolerate outbreaks of violence before or after the announcement by a UN mediator of his plan for the future of the province.

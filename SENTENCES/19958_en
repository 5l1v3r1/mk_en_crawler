SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski presented a set of compromise proposals Monday (September 17th) aimed at overcoming differences that have blocked political debate for months.
Crvenkovski said he was ready to discuss these issues with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who had sent him a letter inviting Crvenkovski to a working meeting to discuss "issues of national interest".
These include filling some vacant ambassadors' posts and seats on the country's Judicial Council, assessing the security situation in Macedonia, and addressing the name dispute with neighbouring Greece.
"I accept this invitation with pleasure and I urge Prime Minister Gruevski to review these proposals and to publicly announce his views about them.
The sooner we hold this meeting, the better," Crvenkovski said.
Relations between the two have been cool for some time.

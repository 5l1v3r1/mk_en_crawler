SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency and the ruling coalition partners reaffirmed their support for Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Tuesday (9 November), averting a government crisis. 
According to the agreement reached during the talks, the tripartite presidency is expected to formally reject Terzic's resignation Wednesday. 
He had offered to resign last week after parliament passed legislation on a VAT tax that differed from the bill backed by the government.
In other news Tuesday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown left for the United States, where he will meet with US and UN officials, as well as representatives of international financial institutions. 
His office says talks will focus on BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration efforts, particularly its bid for membership in the Partnership for Peace programme.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic appealed Wednesday (22 January) for US and international assistance in arresting three men wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal. 
His request followed talks with Pierre-Richard Prosper, the US envoy for war crimes issues. 
Svilanovic said the government is determined to co-operate with the tribunal, but needs US and international intelligence information to track down Gen Ratko Mladic, Maj Veselin Sljivancanin and Col Miroslav Radic. 
Later, Prosper met with President Vojislav Kostunica, who warned that Washington's conditioning of aid to the arrest of war crimes suspects could jeopardise relations between Yugoslavia and the United States.
Prosper also visited Podgorica on Wednesday, meeting with Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. 
He heads to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Thursday to push for the arrest of some 20 war crimes suspects, mostly in Republika Srpska. 
Earlier this month, he told the local daily <I>Dnevni Avaz </I>that Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and other suspects would be in custody by the end of this year.

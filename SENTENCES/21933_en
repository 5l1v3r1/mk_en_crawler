ANKARA, Turkey -- According to media reports Tuesday (October 21st), a preliminary police investigation turned up no evidence of police violence in the case of leftist activist Engin Ceber, who died in an Istanbul prison earlier this month. 
Authorities investigated 19 prison guards whom they suspended amid allegations Ceber died from torture while in custody. 
In a statement immediately after the incident, Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin admitted the activist suffered "ill treatment" by personnel at Istanbul's Metris prison and apologised to Ceber's family.
Human rights groups say Ceber's jailers brutally beat him. 
He died in hospital from a brain haemorrhage. 
Police detained Ceber last month for staging a protest against a case of police violence. 
Lawmakers from the main opposition Republican People's Party have called for Interior Minister Besir Atalay's resignation.

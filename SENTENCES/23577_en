BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government on Monday (March 23rd) asked the European Commission (EC) to advance it 120m euros from the pre-accession funds already earmarked for Serbia.
Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in an attempt to reach agreement on the issue.
The government wants to use the funding to support the budget in negotiating a financial package with the IMF.
Rehn did not give a specific response, saying EC Vice-President Jacques Barrot must also review the request.

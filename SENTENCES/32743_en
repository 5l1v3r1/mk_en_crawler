BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Parliament Speaker Natasa Micic told the press Saturday (14 December) that parliament has, by law, until 8 February to decide when to hold another round of presidential elections.
After the date is announced, candidates would have 30 days to campaign, so the latest date for an election would be 8 March.
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has won two previous rounds, all of which were invalidated by low voter turnout.

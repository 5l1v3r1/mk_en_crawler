PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Former Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said on Sunday (July 29th) he was "absolutely tranquil" about the process against him initiated by the Italian judicial authorities. 
Djukanovic, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Socialists, has been charged with involvement in cigarette smuggling. 
He claims the cigarette transit via the Adriatic was legal, and that "each cent of the incomes the state had to receive from this transit had ended in the state coffers". 
Djukanovic also told Vecernje Novosti that he had no intention of giving up his official functions because of the case.

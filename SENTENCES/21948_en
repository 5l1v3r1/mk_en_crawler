TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha's tour promoting government investments is branded a "tour of lies and unkept promises" by the main opposition Socialist Party (SP). 
"Let's remind the prime minister on pensions and price compensation," SP parliament member Erion Brace said on Saturday (May 17th), adding that a number of investment projects, including highways, should have been completed a year ago. 
Berisha visited four ongoing infrastructure projects in southeast Albania on Saturday.
On other issues, including judicial and electoral reforms, the SP and Berisha's ruling Democratic Party have worked together recently with an eye to EU and NATO integration.

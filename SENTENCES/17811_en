BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey and Kosovo will remain key issues during the upcoming German presidency of the EU, which begins in January. 
Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday (December 19th), German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said resolving the Kosovo status problem and preparing the EU to assume the main role in implementing that solution would be among the chief priorities. 
Steinmeier also said that last week's EU decision to freeze partially accession talks with Turkey was reasonable -- given Ankara's failure to fulfil customs obligations towards EU member Cyprus. 
He stressed, however, that the EU's door remains open to Turkey and that Berlin would seek the continuation of Turkish-EU negotiations by opening "two to four" new chapters.

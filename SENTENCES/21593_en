TIRANA, Albania -- An estimated 30,000 wooden railway ties laid in Albania over the past several years are carcinogenic, according to reports by the Italian media Wednesday (August 20th).
The reports suggest Italy domestically began substituting concrete ties for wooden ones because of the lumber's potentially carcinogenic content.
It reportedly sold the contaminated material to Albania at a low price under an agreement signed between the two countries in 2002.

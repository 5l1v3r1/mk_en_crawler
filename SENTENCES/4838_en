Russia halted gas shipments to Ukraine on Thursday (January 1st) morning after the two countries failed to resolve a dispute over payment arrears and the price of natural gas in 2009.
The negotiations broke off after Russian gas monopoly Gazprom demanded 180 euros per 1,000 cubic metres of gas for 2009, up from the 120 euros it was charging its neighbour in 2008.
Ukraine rejected the demand and issued a counterproposal under which it would agree to pay 144 euros per 1,000 cubic metres if Russia would accept an increase in the fee for the transit of Russian natural gas through Ukrainian territory from 1.22 euros to 1.44 euros per 1,000 cubic metres per 100km. 
Oleh Dubina, the head of Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz, indicated later Thursday that his country was prepared to pay 169 euros per 1,000 cubic metres while charging Russia a transit fee of 1.29 euros.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller then warned that, having turned down the 180-euro offer, Ukraine would have to pay 300 euros per 1,000 cubic metres of gas in 2009.
Gazprom also wants Ukraine to pay all its debt for past deliveries, including fines, by midnight Wednesday.
Naftogaz said it had transferred 1.08 billion euros to RosUkrEnergo, a gas-trading company registered in Switzerland and half-owned by Gazprom. 
But it also indicated that Ukraine would seek international arbitration regarding the remaining 323.3m euros or more that Gazprom is charging as penalties for late payment.
Russia earlier halted gas supplies to Ukraine in January 2006, also in a pricing dispute. 
The move raised questions about the reliability and political exploitation of Russian energy supplies. 
Many accused Moscow of trying to coerce Ukraine's Western-leaning government.
The EU, which saw its supplies disrupted in the 2006 shutoff, says it has enough gas reserves for this winter. 
It receives about a quarter of its gas from Russia. 
After cutting off shipments to Ukraine, Gazprom on Thursday increased gas deliveries through other pipelines in a bid to reassure Western Europeans.
Still, both EU and US officials called on the two countries to resume negotiations and seek a quick solution to the current standoff.
The EU presidency and the European Commission issued a joint statement urging "both sides and their governments to ... 
rapidly reach a successful outcome".
Noting the two countries must bear in mind potential suffering in the event of supply interruptions, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe called for "the predictable flow of energy to Ukraine and the rest of Europe under market-based, transparent conditions".
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko appeared optimistic Kiev and Moscow could reach an agreement by Orthodox Christmas on January 7th.
"I believe we are close to accepting a compromise solution," he said on Thursday.

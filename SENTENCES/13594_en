ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU screening of Croatia's laws in the areas of justice, freedoms and security was due to start Monday (23 January) in Brussels, according to state television HRT.
Issues ranging from asylum to implementation of the Schengen visa regime reportedly will be discussed during the three-day session.
In other news, Croatian authorities are investigating the sale of 5,100 rockets to Macedonia in 2001.
According to local media reports, Skopje signed a contract with Croatian manufacturer Djuro Djakovic Alatnica.
Since the company did not have the rockets in stock, it took them on loan from the defence ministry.
Investigators now say the rockets were never returned, resulting in more than 2m euros in losses to the Croatian military.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The government Thursday (31 October) said it was opposed to "the banning of political parties that are expressing their views in a peaceful and democratic manner." The reference was to legal challenges against Turkey's Justice and Development Party. 
The Turkish constitutional court will hold hearings Friday to determine whether the Islamic organisation is eligible to run in Sunday's elections. 
The country's chief prosecutor wants it banned because its chairman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is ineligible to lead due to a 1998 conviction for Islamic sedition. 
The party has claimed repeatedly that it has severed its Islamic roots, but Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is sceptical. 
Latest polls show the party is leading with 34 per cent. 
The Republican People's Party and the Genc Party trail with 21 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. 
But the Democratic Left Party, a key member of the current ruling coalition, will likely be turned out, which would lead to Ecevit's departure. 
In an interview published Friday with the daily Milliyet, he said he plans to quit politics entirely in less than a year.

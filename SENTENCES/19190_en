TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's parliament held a ceremony on Tuesday (January 29th) to honour the resistance movement that helped the country's Jewish minority escape the Holocaust during World War II. 
According to official figures, more than 1,200 Jews from Balkan countries were hidden by Albanian families during the war.
The head of the US Commission for the Preservation of American Heritage Abroad, Warren Miller, praised Albania for its response to the Holocaust. 
Parliamentary Speaker Jozefina Topalli said the country's efforts were a source of national pride.

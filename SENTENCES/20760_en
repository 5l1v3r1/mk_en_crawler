BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Tuesday (November 6th) that it has approved Bulgaria's plans to build a new nuclear power plant. 
Last year, Sofia picked the Russian firm Atomstroyexport to build two 1,000 megawatt reactors near the northern town of Belene, on the Danube. 
The project will cost more than $5 billion. 
Belene was picked as a site for a nuclear plant in the 1980s but construction was frozen due to lack of funds in the early 1990s. 
EC approval of the project means Bulgaria can apply for a loan of more than 300m euros from the EU's Euratom agency.

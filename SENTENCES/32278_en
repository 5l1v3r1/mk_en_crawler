BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Signaling improved relations with Belgrade. 
Washington agreed on Thursday (3 October) to write off $353.7m, or 66 per cent, of Yugoslavia's $589.4m debt.

Switzerland also agreed Thursday to write off two-thirds of Yugoslavia's debt. 
A total of $177m was forgiven, reducing the amount owed to $91m, repayable over 26 years.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police on Wednesday (May 21st) arrested Naim Halili, a fugitive already sentenced to four years in prison for terrorism.
He was detained in a car, which police say contained a rifle and a cache of cartridges.
Halili disappeared in June 2001, when a court in Kumanovo issued a warrant for him.
He is suspected of a number of serious crimes, including murder and human trafficking.
The interior ministry announced on Wednesday it will continue to investigate Halili's possible involvement in other incidents, including elections incidents in Lipkovo.
Naim is the brother of Zaim Halili, who is suspected of murdering a police station commander in Matejche last year.
He is already behind bars.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Russian and Bulgarian officials signed a host of energy deals during President Vladimir Putin's visit to the Balkan nation on Friday (January 18th). 
One agreement is for Russia to build Bulgaria's second nuclear power plant in Belene for 4 billion euros. 
The two countries also finalized an agreement on the construction of an oil pipeline between the Black Sea port of Burgas and Aegean city of Alexandroupolis, which will improve deliveries of Russian and Caspian oil to the Mediterranean market. 
Additionally, Bulgaria and Russia reached a last-minute agreement on the construction of a new South Stream gas pipeline. 
The nearly 1,000km-long pipeline will run under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and branch off in several directions.
Bulgaria's opposition parties objected strongly to the deals, saying they strengthen the country's dependence on Russian energy. 
They also accused the government of undermining the EU's efforts to diversify energy supplies.

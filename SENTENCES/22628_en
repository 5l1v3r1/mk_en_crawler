PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj criticised the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Hashim Thaci for failing to have a governing programme in place. 
"Thaci offended the citizens of Kosovo when he said that his government did not have a programme because it was involved in resolving Kosovo's status," Haradinaj said on Monday (April 7th), as he resumed his post in the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo. 
He returned to Kosovo last week, after being acquitted of war crimes charges by The Hague tribunal.

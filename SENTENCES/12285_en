SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown says he will discuss possible measures against Republika Srpska (RS) during talks with top EU officials in Brussels this week.
In an interview published in Saturday's (11 June) edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, Ashdown suggested that RS could face restricted financial assistance from the EU for blocking BiH police reform, which is considered crucial to EU integration.
Ashdown also again called on BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic to resolve his dispute with Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.
Terzic recently accepted Ivanic's resignation, six months after he had tendered it in a dispute over a separate high-level appointment.

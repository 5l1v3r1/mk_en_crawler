MOSCOW, Russia -- Russia demanded on Thursday (September 10th) that UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1244 to stabilise the situation in Kosovo. 
In Moscow, Zannier met with Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov and Gennady Gatilov, director of the foreign ministry's Department of International Organisations. 
They insisted that preserving UNMIK's role is a must. 
Zannier acknowledged that while problems remain 18 months after Kosovo declared its independence, "We have certainly contributed to maintaining a satisfactory level of security and stability on the ground." He conceded however "relations between the [Serb and ethnic Albanian] communities are still complex." (Kosova Live, Kohavision - 11/09/09; Klan Kosova, Russia Today - 10/09/09)

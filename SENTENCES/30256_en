ANKARA, Turkey -- US President Barack Obama said on Sunday (December 19th) that despite differences on Israel, ties with Turkey are "more important than ever".
"Our shared interests, our shared values ... 
underpin our relations even when we disagree," Obama said in a written response to questions by the Turkish daily Hurriyet. 
On Iran's nuclear programme, Obama said he remains committed to a diplomatic solution. 
"Notwithstanding our differences about tactics, I firmly believe Turkey shares the goal of preventing a nuclear-armed Iran," Obama said. 
He also urged Turkey and Israel to address tensions, describing them both as "key allies of the United States".
On the topic of WikiLeaks, Obama expressed confidence that the release of US diplomatic cables would not damage ties with Ankara. 
"Our partnership is resilient, and we agreed that the irresponsible acts of Wikileaks do not threaten it," Obama stated. 
He also reiterated US support for Ankara's EU bid and its fight against rebels from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party.

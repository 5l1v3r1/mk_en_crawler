NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police announced Monday (January 25th) that they have broken-up an illegal network for trafficking antiquities -- some dating to 2,000 BC. 
The organisation is believed to be the largest of its kind to be infiltrated on the island. 
Ten Cypriots were arrested in weekend raids and five more are at large. 
Before the arrests, police said, the alleged smugglers agreed to sell goods to undercover officers for 11m euros. 
Among the seized items are copper and silver coins, terracotta urns, clay and limestone figurines and a miniature gold coffin.

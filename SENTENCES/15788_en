SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Polls opened across Bulgaria on Sunday (October 22nd) for the country's fourth presidential election since the ouster of its communist regime in 1989. 
Polls showed incumbent President Georgi Parvanov with a strong lead. 
A poll by Alpha Research published Friday gave the president around 50% of the vote. 
Radical nationalist leader Volen Siderov was second, and Nedelcho Beronov -- the joint candidate of the Union of Democratic Forces and the Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria -- was a distant third.
There are 11,700 polling stations in Bulgaria and 144 abroad, including stations for the 635 Bulgarian peacekeepers deployed in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kosovo and Lebanon. 
If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes and turnout is lower than 50%, a second election round will be held between the two top candidates after seven days.

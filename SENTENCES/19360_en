MOSCOW, Russia -- Russia and Serbia signed an energy co-operation agreement on Friday (January 25th) that guarantees Belgrade a role in building the Serbian section of the South Stream gas pipeline in return for a 51% of national oil company Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS).
The majority stake in NIS will be acquired by Gazprom Neft, a subsidiary of Russia's state-owned gas giant Gazprom, which will also invest at least 500m euros in the modernisation of NIS through 2012.
Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Friday that the US is concerned about Russia's deepening energy ties with Bulgaria and Serbia.
According to diplomatic sources, US officials think the recent energy agreements between Moscow and the two Balkan countries could increase Russia's influence in Europe's energy supplies and could turn them into a political instrument.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX is preparing to send local judges and prosecutors to the District Court of Mitrovica North three years after they were forced out of the area. 
KLAN Kosova TV reported on Monday (April 11th) that on April 18th, under heavy security, the former court employees will return to work. 
There have been reports that Kosovo Serbs plan to protest the return of Albanians to the court located in the Serb-dominated northern part of the city. 
The head of Serb parallel structures Nikola Kabasic has said that they will not allow EULEX to implement its plan unless the court respects Serbia's constitution.

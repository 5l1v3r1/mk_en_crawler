TIRANA, Albania -- The country's main opposition Socialist Party (SP) reacted strongly on Monday (27 February) to accusations of corruption leveled by Prime Minister Sali Berisha, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party. 
SP secretary general Pandeli Majko said the party expects Berisha to present concrete evidence to support allegations he made at the weekend, or face mass rallies organised by the Socialists.
Also Monday, Albania and Greece sealed an agreement on co-operation in protecting children, victims of trafficking and exploitation. 
Officials described the bilateral accords as a positive example for other countries in the region.

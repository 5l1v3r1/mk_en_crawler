ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis said Sunday (25 January) that the chamber would approve the treaty that allows ten countries to join the EU. 
Lawmakers must do so before parliament is dissolved on 15 February, in advance of the 7 March general elections. 
Only Greece, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have not ratified the treaty, which was signed in Athens on 16 April, during the Greek presidency of the EU.
In other news, veteran Greek politician Constantinos Mitsotakis says he will not run in the March elections. 
The former prime minister's career has spanned more than 50 years. 
He is an honorary president of the main opposition party, New Democracy.

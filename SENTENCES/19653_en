ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Friday (September 21st) he would not support any particular party in the November elections, but would instead back programmes that best meet Croatia's interests. 
Speaking on an evening TV show, Mesic said the programmes of the Social Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Union are similar to those he ran on during his own campaign. 
Though the parties supported his campaign, Mesic said he feels no obligation to return the favour.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Saturday (11 June) that the new draft law on state symbols would be submitted to parliament by 22 June and endorsed by the end of the month.
His comment followed a meeting in Mavrovo with the leaders of the main parties.
The law, envisioned under the Ohrid Peace Accords, remains controversial, as it allows the use of other states' symbols by ethnic minorities in Macedonia, in areas where those minorities comprise a certain percentage of the population.
In other news, the EU-Macedonia committee for Stabilisation and Association met for a second time Friday in Skopje.
The EC representatives urged intensified efforts particularly as regards reforms in the judicial sector, home affairs and decentralisation.
Separately, German expert Theodor Waigel, economic adviser to Prime Minister Buckovski, said in a TV interview that Macedonia must continue reforming its public administration and judiciary, as well as resolve all ethnic problems, if it hopes to receive official EU candidate status this year.

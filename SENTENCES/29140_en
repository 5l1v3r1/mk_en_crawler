NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Talks to reunify Cyprus are continuing in line with the parameters that have already been agreed between the Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders and the UN, Alexander Downer, the UN secretary-general's special adviser on Cyprus, said on Friday (June 4th).
"All chapters are being negotiated with the aim of increasing the points of convergence on the understanding that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed," Downer said.
He announced that Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu will meet again next week.

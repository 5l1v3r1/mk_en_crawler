BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian journalists gathered in front of the presidential palace in Bucharest Saturday (23 April), calling for the release of three colleagues being held hostage in Iraq. 
The previous day, the three -- Marie Jeanne Ion, Ovidiu Ohanesian and Sorin Miscoci -- were shown on a videotape broadcast by the Arab satellite station Al-Jazeera, saying that their captors would kill them unless Romania withdraws its troops from Iraq within four days. 
They were abducted with their Iraqi-American translator on 28 March. 
In a statement, Romanian President Traian Basescu's office said authorities were doing everything possible in order to resolve the hostage crisis.

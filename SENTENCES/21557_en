SOFIA, Bulgaria -- NATO's peacekeeping force will remain in Kosovo, and no time frame for its withdrawal has been considered so far, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Friday (May 23rd) in Sofia. 
Scheffer, on a one-day visit, expressed certainty that the 16,000-strong KFOR would remain in Kosovo after June 15th, when the Kosovo constitution takes effect and the UN hands over responsibilities to Pristina. 
He also said it was very important for the EU and the UN to determine their responsibilities in Kosovo after that date.
Scheffer voiced optimism that Macedonia would resolve its name dispute with Greece, and emphasized that it must do so in order to receive a NATO invitation. 
During his visit, he met with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev.

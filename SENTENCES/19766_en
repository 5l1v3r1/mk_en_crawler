BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission may open several new chapters with Zagreb during next month's negotiations, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told Croatia's Deputy Parliament Speaker Gordana Djurovic in Brussels on Thursday (September 20th). 
Rehn said progress has been good up until this point and he hopes further areas will be open for discussion by the end of the year, when Portugal's EU presidency ends. 
Croatia's goal is to open all negotiating chapters by the end of the year and close them by the end of 2008.

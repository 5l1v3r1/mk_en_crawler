ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor told RTL television on Sunday (September 13th) that she is not considering any cabinet changes.
The statement came amid growing media speculation about conflicts between Kosor and some of the ministers.
In particular, Kosor is reportedly dissatisfied with Damir Polancec, deputy prime minister and economy minister, because of the recent hike in fuel prices.
There is also reported conflict with Health Minister Darko Milinovic over the controversial new law on artificial insemination.

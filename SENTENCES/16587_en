TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Thursday (November 9th) indicated that Albania would accept Greece's decision to grant double citizenship to the Greek minority living in Albania. 
The Greek minority Party for Human Rights hailed Berisha's statement, saying that Albania has proven it is ready to act in conformity with EU practices. 
Some 20,000 Albanian citizens, members of the Greek minority, are expected to be issued Greek passports.
Also on Thursday, Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu told parliament that the ministry plans to destroy more than 100,000 tonnes of ammunition that is not needed by the Albanian Army. 
He explained those weapons are outdated and would not meet the standards required by NATO.

TIRANA, Albania -- The country is on the brink of a serious electricity shortage due to the summer drought, according to the economy ministry. 
AFP quoted a ministry spokesman on Wednesday (August 15th) who said that water levels in dam lakes have dropped by 85%, forcing the government to introduce restrictions on electricity consumption by households, government institutions and factories. 
Workdays are shrinking from eight to five hours in some cases, or shifts are moving to evening or nights when electricity consumption is lower. 
Albania needs about 18m kWh of electricity daily. 
The country produces 5.5m kWh and imports more than 6.5m kWh. 
Aging hydro electricity plants, built during the communist era, are the only source of electricity in Albania, though foreign investment may be picking up.

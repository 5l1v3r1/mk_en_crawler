BELGRADE, Serbia -- Sandor Egeresi, the head of the Vojvodina Hungarians' Union (SVM), said on Monday (December 28th) that his party remains part of the ruling coalition both on the central and provincial level, even though it did not support Serbia's or Vojvodina's budgets. 
Egeresi, who is also president of the Assembly of Vojvodina, urged representatives of the Democratic Party and the SVM to engage in a dialogue to settle differences between them. 
The SVM, part of the ruling coalition, withdrew its support for the central budget, insisting there was not enough money in it for capital investments in Vojvodina. 
The budget squeaked last week with the support of two independent lawmakers and one ethnic Albanian member of parliament proving pivotal.

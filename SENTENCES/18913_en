ZAGREB, Croatia -- The head of the European Commission's (EC) Delegation in Zagreb, Vincent Degert, said on Monday (December 4th) that the EC is following developments in the case of Branimir Glavas, the parliament member charged with committing war crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. 
An investigating judge released him from custody at the weekend and postponed the trial, taking into consideration a hunger strike waged by the defendant. 
Degert said he was concerned the decision was setting a dubious precedent.
President Stipe Mesic issued a statement of his own Monday, calling for full adherence to the law in this case and for an end to any attempts to politicise it. 
Otherwise, he said, Croatia's image would be affected.

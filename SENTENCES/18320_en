ANKARA, Turkey -- UN special envoy for Iraq Ashraf Qazi visited Ankara on Thursday (February 15th) as part of a tour aimed at boosting regional support for peace efforts in Iraq.
He held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
The two reportedly agreed on the need for a "greater regional engagement to bolster efforts aimed at promoting dialogue, reconciliation and consensus building in Iraq."
Separately, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested on Thursday that Ankara might make steps to establish contacts with Iraqi Kurdish leaders.
He added that such an initiative would be aimed at bringing peace to both sides of the border.
In other news Thursday, Turkish Army chief General Yasar Buyukanit met with US Vice-President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley in Washington.
They focused on two main issues:
the fight against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party -- which Turkey says has bases in northern Iraq -- and White House opposition to a US Congressional resolution describing the mass killings of Armenians in Turkey during World War I as genocide.

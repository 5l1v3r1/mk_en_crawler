BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Monica Macovei warned on Monday (January 8th) that Romania is losing its will to fight corruption. 
In the interview with the Brussels-based web publication EU Observer, she complained that political support for reforming the judiciary is disappearing and that officials are dragging their feet in establishing an independent panel, the Agency for Integrity, to watch for conflicts of interest. 
The bill on the Integrity Agency was submitted to parliament in April but has yet to be adopted.

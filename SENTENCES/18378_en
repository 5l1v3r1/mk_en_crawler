SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Four people, including a six-month old baby and his Serbian mother, were seriously wounded in a shoot-out Wednesday evening (July 11th) in Sofia. 
All four are described as relatives of Knead Milenkovic, a leader of Serbia's notorious Zemun Clan. 
The baby, who was shot in the hand, is believed to be his son.
Police say they found illegal weapons, drugs and false passports in a subsequent search of an apartment the victims shared. 
The search for the shooters continues. 
The attack came only hours after businessman Manol Velev, husband of State Agency for Youth and Sports chief Vessela Lecheva, was shot several times near his Sofia office.

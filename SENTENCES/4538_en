Turkish police arrested dozens of Hizballah and al-Qaeda suspects last month, uncovering new terrorist recruitment and propaganda cells.
The Turkish Hizballah -- not affiliated with the Lebanese organisation -- consists of Sunni Kurds, and is responsible for at least 200 deaths from 1993 to 2001.
Inspired by the Iranian Islamic revolution, Hizballah has set out to create an Islamic state, against the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Hizballah has been able to spread propaganda through the internet and solidarity meetings.
In 2007, Turkish police uncovered a link between Hizballah and al-Qaeda forces, after foiling an attack and arresting dangerous militant Muhammed Yaşar.
Last year, police also arrested Fatih Yildız, who had spent time training in Afghanistan.
Several dozen radical Islamist Turks have been trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Some fought as jihadists in Chechnya and Iraq, others spread terror in Turkey.
In 2003, attacks on two synagogues, the British consulate and the HSBC headquarters left 57 dead in Istanbul.
The recent crackdown has focused on areas such as Malatya and Elazig.
Several documents, computers and other evidence have been confiscated.
Hizballah absorbed its biggest blow in 2000, when a sting operation spurred an hour-long gunfight, killing group leader Huseyin Velioglu.
After the incident, police seized the organisation's archives, which allowed them to uncover dozens of its cells.
A number of Hizballah's leading members have since been detained -- including the alleged military leader, Haci Inan -- and charged with founding a terrorist organisation to overthrow the Turkish government.
There have been over 70 trials in various courts in Diyarbakir, Ankara and Istanbul.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic met with Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki in Belgrade on Monday (December 18th). 
They agreed that one unresolved bilateral issue remains -- co-operation between the Serbian and Macedonian Orthodox Churches. 
Milososki used the meeting to congratulate Serbia on joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, stressing the move clearly marks the end of international isolation. 
The two ministers also discussed the Kosovo issue.

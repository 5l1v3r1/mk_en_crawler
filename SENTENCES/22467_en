SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski on Wednesday (September 10th) said he expects UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz to present a new proposal for resolving the long-running name dispute with Greece. 
"In such a case, we will have to scrutinise this new proposal and harmonise our positions," Crvenkovski told journalists. 
On Thursday, Nimetz holds a fresh round of talks in New York with Greek representative Adamantios Vassilakis and Macedonian counterpart Nikola Dimitrov.

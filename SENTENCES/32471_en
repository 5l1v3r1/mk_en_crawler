TIRANA, Albania -- Sali Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, said Saturday (15 March) that the ruling Socialist cabinet is corrupt and promotes organised crime.
He cited a recent IMF report, which noted the high level of corruption in the country.
According to Berisha, the government led by Prime Minister Fatos Nano has made no effort to fight fraud and misuse of state funds.
The government meanwhile announced that tax collection surpassed targets for the first two months of the year, meeting one of the main requirements set by IMF.

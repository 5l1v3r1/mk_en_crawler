ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A suspect in the November 2003 Istanbul bombings admitted before a local court that al-Qaeda had provided him 122,000 euros for the attacks.
Adnan Ersoz also said he had received training in Afghanistan and met with Osama bin Laden before 11 September 2001.
Harun Ilhan, a defendant in the same case, acknowledged that he was one of the bombers and said he and two others carried out the attacks.
One of them, Habib Akdas, was killed recently in Iraq, while Gurcan Bac is still on the run.
The other 66 defendants admitted involvement with extremist groups or attendance at training camps in Afghanistan, but denied participation in the bombings.
The blasts at two synagogues, the British consulate in Istanbul and the HSBC bank headquarters killed a total of 61 people and injured more than 600.

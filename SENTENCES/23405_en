THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (April 29th) rejected a motion by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic challenging the court's jurisdiction to try him.
In a 33-page ruling, Judge Ian Bonomy said Karadzic's arguments are weak.
He had challenged two counts of genocide in his indictment and the court's jurisdiction to prosecute him over holding UN peacekeepers as hostages.
Despite rejecting the jurisdictional part of the challenge, Bonomy ordered one change in the indictment:
a part stating Karadzic could have predicted some of the crimes would occur.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former guerrilla commander Hashim Thaci won the second round of local elections held on Saturday (December 8th).
According to preliminary results, the PDK won 14 of the 23 mayoral run-offs.
Thus, the party will have 17 mayors in Kosovo's 30 municipalities.
A second round was not held in the Serb municipalities of Leposavic, Zubin Potok and Zvecan due to a boycott by Serb voters.
The PDK also won the November 17th parliamentary elections.

TRIPOLI, Libya -- The EU has asked Libyan authorities to drop charges against six Bulgarian healthcare workers accused of intentionally spreading the HIV infection in a Benghazi hospital.
Speaking on Tuesday (13 January), Bulgarian Ambassador to Tripoli Zdravko Velev said the EU had cited the nature of the charges and the lack of proof.
The workers were first detained in 1999.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Cypriots aim to conclude reunification talks with Greek Cypriots by the end of 2008 or mid 2009, the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Ferdi Sabit Soyer, said on Friday (September 12th).
"Negotiations cover not only administration but several issues, such as territory, EU relations, economic relations, property rights and all aspects of the Cyprus problem.
So, time is important and the process should not take longer than expected," he told journalists in Istanbul, where he was on a visit.
Asked about Greek Cypriots' demand that Turkish troops withdraw from the island, he said a number of troops would stay in Cyprus and the rest would leave on a timetable.
"Turkish troops will not leave the island without a solution.
When negotiations reach a solution, Turkey's guarantor status will continue and the Turkish army will have presence on the island," he said.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders to "demonstrate their political leadership with a sense of flexibility and wisdom".
Both leaders "should look to the future of the Cypriot people and demonstrate flexibility, especially when discussing power sharing, governance and property rights," he said Friday.
In Nicosia, UN special envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer said there will be no UN plan for the island's reunification.
Rather, he said, the decision will depend on the political will of the leaders and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.

ATHENS, Greece -- Employment Minister Fanny Palli-Petralia received on Friday (February 22nd) a parcel with six bullets in it. 
The police said they were investigating the envelope, which contained the bullets and a newspaper article referring to a widely disputed plan of the government to reform the country's pension system. 
Palli-Petralia is a central figure in the reform, which has been sharply opposed by the local trade unions and has triggered massive nationwide protests.

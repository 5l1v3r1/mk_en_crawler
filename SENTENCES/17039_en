SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Thousands of tourists remained stranded in their hotel rooms or had to be evacuated from flooded buildings, campsites and damaged cars following torrential rains around Bulgaria's southern Black Sea coast on Sunday (2 July). 
The Civil Protection Service says rescue teams worked through the night to drain water from damaged buildings in the municipalities of Nessebar, Sozopol and Obzor. 
There were no reports of casualties.
Local media in Romania, meanwhile, report that Pope Benedict XVI has donated 30,000 euros to the victims of recent flooding. 
At least 21 deaths in Romania have been blamed on flooding in the past two weeks.

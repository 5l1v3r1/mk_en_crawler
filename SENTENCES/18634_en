SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a toughly worded statement on Thursday (June 7th), Republika Serpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik again warned the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, Haris Silajdzic, to stop his anti-Serb rhetoric.
At issue are remarks Silajdzic made in London earlier this week, in which he blamed RS for the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica and said it therefore deserves no recognition from the international community.
Dodik warned that further attempts to humiliate and ignore Bosnian Serbs would preclude any chance of coexistence.
In other news, Italian and British police have arrested nine Tunisians, alleged members of a terrorist group with ties to al-Qaeda.
Police say they were sent to training camps in Afghanistan and then fought in a number of countries, including BiH.

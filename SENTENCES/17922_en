ZAGREB, Croatia -- A two-day meeting of the Croatian-EU interparliamentary committee kicked off on Tuesday (March 20th) in Zagreb, focusing on Croatia's progress in harmonising its legislation with EU laws, as well as judicial reforms and fighting corruption. 
Zagreb expects to open talks on the remaining chapters of the acquis this year, complete the negotiations next year, and join the EU in 2009.
Separately, Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks said the government has no plans to organise a referendum on Croatia's accession to NATO. 
He said there is no doubt about the benefits stemming from Alliance membership.

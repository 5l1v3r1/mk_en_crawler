STRASBOURG, France -- Members of the European Parliament (EP) adopted a resolution Wednesday (March 9th) praising Montenegro's progress in its EU integration process, but also voicing concern about corruption levels. 
The document welcomes the European Council decision to grant Montenegro EU candidate status and voices hope that the accession talks will start this year. 
The EP members encourage authorities to grant women stronger representation in decision-making processes and to improve the living conditions of the minority Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian people. 
The resolution also calls for efforts to ensure media independence and for tangible results in fighting organised crime and money laundering.

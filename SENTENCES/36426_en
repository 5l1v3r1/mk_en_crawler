SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR interrogated Bosnian Serb Milovan Bjelica on Saturday (15 May), who is suspected of supporting indicted war criminals.
Arrested Friday in Sokolac, Bjelica is described as one of Radovan Karadzic's closest allies.
In March, international community High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown banned him from holding any public or elected office.
According to SFOR spokesman Robert Lapreze, for security reasons, Bjelica is being kept in a secret location.
In other news, the Republika Srpska (RS) government has replaced Dragan Lukac, the chief of police special operations, whose officers killed a civilian while searching for war crimes suspects.
Lukac vowed at the time that he would stop all such operations unless police get the backing of all institutions in RS.
The UNDP's office in Sarajevo announced, meanwhile, that Canada has donated $3.3m to the BiH mine-clearing effort.
The money would be used to clear areas crucial to economic development.
Canada has so far contributed more than $8m to mine-removal in BiH.

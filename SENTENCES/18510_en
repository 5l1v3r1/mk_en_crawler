ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court's out-of-court panel will rule on Monday (December 11th) regarding an appeal filed by prosecutors after the investigating judge released war crimes indictee Branimir Glavas from custody and adjourned the trial.
Glavas was in poor health after staging a month-long hunger strike.
The parliament member is accused of war crimes in 1991 against ethnic Serbs civilians in Osijek.
Last week, the European Commission's (EC) Ambassador to Zagreb, Vincent Degert, said the EC was following the case closely.

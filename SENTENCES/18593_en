BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission welcomed on Monday (May 7th) Bulgaria's efforts to get to the bottom of a corruption scandal that has already resulted in the dismissal of two deputy ministers and the suspension of Deputy Prime Minister Rumen Ovcharov.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev have invited the Commission to send an expert to monitor the probe.
Two EU officials, Michael Humphreys and Geoffrey Van Orden, said in Sofia on Tuesday that while the EU could assist in the probe, Bulgaria is responsible for its internal affairs.
In other news, Stanishev is in Moscow discussing co-operation in the energy sector, including construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, the Belene nuclear power plant, and ways to extend an agreement on transiting Russian natural gas through Bulgaria.

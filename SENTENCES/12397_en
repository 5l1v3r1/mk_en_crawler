ZAGREB Croatia -- The UN Secretary General's Representative on the Human Rights of Internally-Displaced Persons, Walter Kalin, said Thursday (9 June) there is a comparatively small number of outstanding issues regarding internally displaced people in Croatia and the government should intensify efforts to resolve them. 
Kalin added that the government should take the necessary practical steps so the international community can remove Croatia from the list of countries where the plight of internally displaced persons is "cause for concern".

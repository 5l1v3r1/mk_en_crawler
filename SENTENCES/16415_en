BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The main board of G17 Plus decided on Saturday (13 May) that the party would remain in the Serbian coalition government until 30 September. 
Its participation afterwards will depend on whether the Ratko Mladic case has been resolved and Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU restarted. 
The decision came after a power struggle in the party between G17 Plus Vice President and incumbent Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic -- who favoured staying in the coalition for now -- and party President Miroljub Labus, who was urging G17 Plus to withdraw. 
Labus, who resigned his post as Serbian deputy prime minister after the EU cut off talks over the Mladic case, has now also stepped down as head of G17 Plus.

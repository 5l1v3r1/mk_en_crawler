ANKARA, Turkey -- Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya of the Supreme Court of Appeals has submitted a request for a ban on the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He claims the party is undermining the secular character of the state.
The Constitutional Court has the power to ban political parties and is due to review the indictment on Monday (March 17th).
The prosecutor's appeal comes after the AKP and one of the opposition parties in parliament supported a reform to allow Islamic headscarves to be worn in universities.
Reacting to the indictment, Erdogan said on Saturday that it represented a violation of the national will.
He said that about 16.5 million voters supported the AKP at the last parliamentary elections held in July 2007, representing 47% of all votes.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on the Turkish justice system on Saturday to refrain from interfering in politics.
In a European democratic country political problems are discussed in parliament and are resolved through elections, not in courts, Rehn told journalists in Brussels.

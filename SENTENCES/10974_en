ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic is sceptical that fugitive General Ante Gotovina will ever surrender to The Hague tribunal. 
Commenting on recent Western calls for Gotovina to act like a true patriot and hand himself over, Mesic told local media on Wednesday (30 March) that the general could have demonstrated patriotism a long time ago, if he had wanted to do so. 
Earlier this month, EU foreign ministers delayed the start of membership negotiations with Croatia, citing insufficient co-operation with the war crimes tribunal.

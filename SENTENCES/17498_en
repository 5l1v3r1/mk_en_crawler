SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Civil Aviation Authority and the Spanish producer of civil aviation control equipment, Indra Sistemas SA, signed an equipment delivery agreement on Friday (July 27th). 
The deal will enable BiH to take full control over the air traffic in its sky.
BiH is presently responsible for its middle sky -- from 3,000-8,000m. 
Due to lack of proper equipment, the state pays Serbia and Croatia to help control its upper sky -- over 8,000m. 
With the Spanish equipment, however, the Zagreb and Belgrade centres would no longer be engaged.

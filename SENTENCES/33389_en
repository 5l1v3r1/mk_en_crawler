SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian government adopted an amendment to the criminal code Tuesday (3 June), imposing stricter penalties for illegal possession of arms. 
The regulation precedes the campaign for voluntary collection of illegal weapons, which will start this month. 
The amendment envisages sentences of one to ten years in prison for people who fail to hand over their illegal arms or who illegally manufacture, possess, sell, supply or exchange firearms or explosives. 
The government also reviewed the draft state programme for the prevention and suppression of corruption, which is to be used for basis of the national strategy for curbing corruption.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) staged protests Monday (7 August) morning over its exclusion from the new VMRO-DPMNE-led ruling coalition. 
DUI supporters blocked highways in northwest Macedonia for 30 minutes. 
Senior party official Rafiz Aliti says the decision of Prime Minister designate Nikola Gruevski to exclude DUI -- which won the majority of ethnic Albanian votes in the 5 July parliamentary elections -- from the cabinet represents a violation of the Ohrid Peace Accords. 
VMRO-DPMNE has dismissed that claim, noting that an ethnic Albanian partner -- the Democratic Party of Albanians -- will be in the coalition.

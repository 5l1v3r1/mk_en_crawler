ANKARA, Turkey -- The country will launch its first 24-hour Kurdish-language TV channel on Thursday (January 1st), according to media reports Saturday.
The state-run news channel is aimed at attracting fans of Roj TV, a satellite station based in Belgium that is popular among Turkey's 14 million Kurds.
Turkey has often criticised Roj TV for broadcasting statements by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Turkey lifted bans on broadcasts in Kurdish in 2002, but bureaucratic delays affected implementation.
In other news, Turkish jets bombed PKK hideouts in northern Iraq on Sunday, striking several targets in the Kurdish districts of Khwakurk and Khnera, PKK spokesman Ahmed Denis confirmed.
Turkish military sources also confirmed air strikes Saturday and Sunday targeting the PKK along the Turkish-Iraqi border, as well as inside Turkey, near the border with Iraq.
The prime ministers of Turkey and Iraq agreed last week to continue co-operation against the PKK in northern Iraq.
Separately Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said Turkey plans to establish a new anti-terror unit dedicated solely to this mission.
The government says current institutions involved in the fight against terrorism lack co-ordination.

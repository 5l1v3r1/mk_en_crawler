THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will visit Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo in early June, her spokeswoman Florence Hartmann confirmed Tuesday (24 May). 
Del Ponte's regional trip will precede her address to the UN Security Council on 13 June, when she will report on the former Yugoslav republics' co-operation with the tribunal.
Also on Tuesday, a UN tribunal panel heard arguments by lawyers representing former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
The ex-Kosovo Albanian guerrilla commander is seeking provisional release until his trial begins. 
Prosecutors oppose the idea.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (April 21st) warned the hard-line National Unity Party (UBP), which won Sunday's parliamentary elections in northern Cyprus, against disrupting ongoing reunification talks with Greek Cypriots.
"It would be very wrong for the new government to end the negotiations or to continue the talks on a basis different from the one followed so far," Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling Justice and Development Party.
"The process must continue exactly as before.
We will never support a move that would weaken the position of [Turkish Cypriot leader] Mehmet Ali Talat," he stressed.
He was responding to UBP leader Dervis Eroglu, who suggested the reunification talks should focus on a two-state solution.
Greek Cypriots support a solution based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.
Separately Tuesday, UN Special Representative in Cyprus Taye-Brook Zerihoun downplayed concerns saying "the UN does not anticipate any problems" in the peace process due to the election results.
Talat and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias held their regular round of talks Tuesday, focusing this time on economy-related issues.

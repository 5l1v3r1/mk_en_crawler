TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist mayor of Tirana called on outgoing Prime Minister Fatos Nano to resign as leader of the Socialist Party because of its defeat in the general election two months ago.
Edi Rama said in an interview on Friday (26 August) that his party should look forward and overcome recent rifts that led to desertions and the formation of a new left-wing organisation.
With final election results expected later this week, the Democrats and their allies will likely control 80 seats in the 140-seat parliament.

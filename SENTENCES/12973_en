BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following talks with Serbian government officials in Belgrade on Monday (31 January), European Parliament (EP) deputy Doris Pack said Serbian authorities are addressing the interethnic incidents in Vojvodina and are determined to prevent any repetition of last year's violence.
Pack spoke at a news conference as an EP committee she heads wrapped up a three-day visit to Serbia to investigate the incidents.
The delegation met with local government authorities and Hungarian minority representatives in Vojvodina.
In other news, the former head of the Serbian government's information office, Vladimir "Beba" Popovic, told local B92 that certain circles in the Serbian Army were behind the March 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
In an interview broadcast Monday, Popovic said the political background of the murder had never been clarified because it would have meant a security breach for the Serbian military.

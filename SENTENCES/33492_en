NIS, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic has reportedly told leaders of the Independent Union that he will submit his resignation if it organises mass protest rallies in Belgrade.
In an interview for TV 5 in Nis on Saturday (27 September), Zivkovic denied making such a statement but said that he would consider such a move should protests be held.
Also Saturday, Deputy Serbian Prime Minister Miodrag Isakov said the election of a president in November will be the first step towards full parliamentary elections.
The presidential campaign should be followed by adoption of a new constitution and new electoral legislation creating fair rules for parliamentary elections, he added.
Serbs will go the polls on 16 November to elect a president.
Two attempts failed last year when turnout fell below the required 50 per cent.

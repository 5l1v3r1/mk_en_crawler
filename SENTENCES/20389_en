ATHENS, Greece -- Former Supreme Court Prosecutor Giorgos Zorbas, who heads up the committee formed to combat money laundering, has shed new light on the bond scandal that shook the country a couple of months ago, the Ta Nea daily reported on Monday (August 13th). 
At issue is the sale of a 280m-euro government bond to four pension funds. 
According to his findings, the bonds were issued illegally by two ministries -- economy and finance, and defence. 
Since the money raised would be used to finance government weapons programmes, the transactions were in effect "hidden" and not subject to agreements on the secondary bond market -- thus opening the way for million-euro commissions. 
On Friday, Zorbas submitted his findings to Athens prosecutor Panayiotis Poulios. 
Government officials downplayed the report Sunday, saying it dealt with "ordinary issues" attributed "illogical size".

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Outgoing UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen announced on Friday (16 June) that he would postpone Kosovo's municipal elections to make sure politicians remain focused on talks regarding the province's final status.
The elections, which were scheduled for the fall, should be held no earlier than three months and no later than six months after the UN Security Council issues a resolution on Kosovo's future.
This is expected to happen at the end of the year.
The delay is in the interest of all of Kosovo's communities, Soren-Petersen said.
Also Friday, the government announced that Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku and President Fatmir Mediu are visiting Washington this week, including a meeting Monday with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

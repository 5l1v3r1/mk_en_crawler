BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has begun consulting with parliamentary parties about a potential referendum to introduce a majority voting system in parliamentary elections. 
The opposition Social Democrats (PSD), along with the governing Democratic Party (PD) and Hungarian Democrats met with Basescu on Tuesday (March 6th). 
Talks with the Liberals, also part of the governing coalition, along with the opposition Greater Romania Party and the Conservatives (PC), are expected on Wednesday. 
The PSD reportedly asked the president to drop his plan for a referendum, while the PC is pushing for its postponement.

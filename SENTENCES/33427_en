SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Association of Civil Servants asked the government Saturday (31 May) to provide details on its public administration reform plan. 
According to Tance Tanusevski, who chairs the association, the current downsizing plans -- especially one for employees of ESM, the country's power utility -- are incomplete and economically irrational. 
Tanusevski also protested planned electricity prices hikes, saying his group has launched a petition drive against them.
In other news, two officers with the Macedonian Army will leave Monday for Kuwait to help co-ordinate participation in the peacekeeping mission in Iraq. 
Macedonia previously contributed a small contingent to the international effort in Afghanistan.

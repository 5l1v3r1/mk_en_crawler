PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A hand grenade was thrown near a police station in Zubin Potok, in northern Kosovo, early Thursday (April 29th), causing some damage but no injuries.
Around the same time, a blast in the small Serb-dominated town damaged an antenna of the IPKO mobile company.
This was the third attack against IPKO property in the last week, since authorities began dismantling Serbian mobile communications networks.
The public mobile company VALA said on Thursday it has distributed 5,000 SIM-cards to Serbs and is charging only half price for calls from VALA to Serbian operators.

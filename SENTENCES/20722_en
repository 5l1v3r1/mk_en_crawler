SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The main Bosniak parties in BiH are warning against any reshuffle of the state cabinet. 
In separate statements published in Wednesday's (August 8th) edition of Dnevni Avaz, the Party for BiH (SBiH) and the Party for Democratic Action (SDA) responded to a comment last week by Prime Minister Nikola Spiric. 
He suggested he would restructure the Council of Ministers after the summer recess due to the poor performance of some ministers, reportedly Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj of the SBiH and Security Minister Tarik Sadovic of the SDA. 
The Bosniak parties say it is Spiric who should be blamed for any issues with the cabinet's performance.

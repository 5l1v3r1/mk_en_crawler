ATHENS, Greece -- Participants in a Mediterranean Climate Change Initiative conference in Athens adopted a declaration Friday (October 22nd) voicing their commitment to measures needed to reduce the effects of climate changes. 
They vowed to work together to address the problems of global warming, despite political conflicts between some of them. 
"Our impressive participation here proves that we realise the threat from the repercussions of climatic changes, for culture, the economy, security, the quality of our life but, mainly it proves the common will, despite the differences and the conflicts, because climatic change threatens the survival of all of us," Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said, as the conference opened.
On the sidelines, Papandreou met with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
They agreed to step up co-operation at all levels, especially in efforts to deal with illegal immigrants entering Greece via Turkey.

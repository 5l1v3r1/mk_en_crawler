TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian and Montenegrin authorities signed an agreement Tuesday (December 14th) to dredge or deepen the bed of the Buna River, which passes the northern town of Shkodra and through Montenegro into the Adriatic Sea.
The agreement, signed by Environment Ministers Fatmir Mediu and Milutin Simovic, will clear and deepen the bed of the river, which has flooded the region several times this year causing serious damage.

SYDNEY, Australia -- Former Serb paramilitary leader Dragan Vasiljkovic won an appeal Wednesday (September 2nd), halting his extradition from Australia to Croatia. 
A court ordered his release from prison. 
Vasiljkovic, 54, known as "Captain Dragan", was arrested in January 2006 on the basis of an Interpol warrant issued by Zagreb. 
Croatia accuses Vasiljkovic of involvement in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993. 
An Australian court, however, concluded that if Vasiljkovic was to be extradited to Croatia for trial on war crimes charges, he would face "a substantial or real chance of prejudice".

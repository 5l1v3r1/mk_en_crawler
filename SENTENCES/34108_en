SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The first contingent of Bulgarian peacekeepers will leave for Iraq on Friday (25 July), local sources quoted Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov as saying. 
The group includes 30 servicemen who will prepare for the arrival of the rest of the unit, which will be under the command of the Polish contingent in Iraq. 
President Georgi Parvanov said the departure of the initial group was in line with deadlines set by parliament. 
Amid concerns of insufficient funding, he reiterated his opinion that the unit should be absolutely ready for the mission before it is deployed.
In other news, leaders of the youth wing of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces resigned Sunday. 
The national executive council of the youth organisation, led by Miroslav Borshosh, said the party was being ruled by an oligarchy, surrounded by rumours, plots and corruption. 
Although the youth leaders had little power, their move signals a deepening crisis within the right-wing party in advance of local elections scheduled for October.

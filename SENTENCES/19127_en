ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu late Tuesday (February 27th) evening, according to media reports Wednesday.
The opposition Republican People's Party had accused Erdogan and Aksu of misconduct in office following the January murder of Hrant Dink, the Turkish-Armenian journalist gunned down in Istanbul.
The ruling Justice and Development Party provided enough votes to reject the motion.
In other news, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party unanimously re-elected Ahmet Turk as leader, at an extraordinary party congress in Ankara on Wednesday.
During his speech, Turk insisted that authorities consider full amnesty for members of the outlawed terrorist group Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).

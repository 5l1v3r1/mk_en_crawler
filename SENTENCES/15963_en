SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Constitutional Court ruled on Saturday (November 18th) that Republika Srpska's (RS) law on celebrations and national holidays violates constitutional principles setting forth the equality of all constituent nations in BiH. 
According to the court, the law provides only for honouring Serb history, traditions, customs and national identity, while jeopardising the interests of non-Serbs in RS. 
While Bosnian Serbs have a legitimate right to defend their traditions and identity, the same right must be granted to others, the judges ruled.
At the same time, the court ruled that laws on the entity's coat-of-arms and flag were not unconstitutional.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Sunday (4 May) that the government would react to any attempt to destabilise the country. 
This was in response to media reports about new tensions in the former crisis areas of Tetovo and Kumanovo over the past few days, including reports that mayors from the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) were distributing uniforms to local ethnic Albanians. 
Buckovski said that he could not confirm this information, but reiterated Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski's vow that, if such developments are verified, the government would immediately react. 
DPA recently decided to boycott participation in parliament, citing what it described as the stalled implementation of the Ohrid agreement.

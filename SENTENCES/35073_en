BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) is planning both party leadership and cabinet changes, probably this week, according to a statement Friday (25 June) by PSD President Octav Cozmanca. 
Later in the day however, a government spokesperson said no firm decision has been made. 
According to press reports, any reshuffle would be in response to PSD's weak performance during the recent local elections, in advance of general elections this autumn.
In other news, Romania announced that it plans to introduce a visa regime for citizens of Serbia-Montenegro starting on 1 July. 
Bucharest says the move stems from its obligations as a candidate for EU membership.

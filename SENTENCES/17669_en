BUCHAREST, Romania -- Some 400 Chinese women working in a textile factory in the northern Romanian town of Bacau have called a strike to protest wages and living conditions. 
They want their salaries doubled, to $700 a month. 
A local manager said that would drive the factory out of business. 
He said the women were getting roughly Romania's average wage but their incomes were eroded by the high fees charged by a Chinese recruitment agency. 
The women live in dormitories and speak no foreign languages.

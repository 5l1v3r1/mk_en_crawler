CHISINAU, Moldova -- Romania will not change its stance against Kosovo's independence, despite the call from the European Parliament (EP), Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi said on Friday (July 9th), during a visit to Moldova.
The EP adopted a resolution Thursday calling on all EU members to recognise Kosovo.
Romania is among the five that have refused to do so.
Baconschi said that Romania is awaiting the opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legality of Kosovo's February 2008 independence declaration.

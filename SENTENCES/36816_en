BUCHAREST, Romania -- Five newly-appointed cabinet ministers were sworn in during a ceremony Wednesday (14 July).
Following a shuffle earlier this week, Dan Mircea Popescu was appointed as the new labour minister, Petre Daea as agriculture minister, Silvia Adriana Ticau as minister of communications, Gheorghe Emacu as minister-delegate for public administration, and Bogdan Niculescu-Duvaz as minister-delegate for social partners.
Their five predecessors resigned to assume higher positions in the ruling Social Democrat Party.
In other news Wednesday, the US Embassy in Bucharest withdrew an offer to provide $400,000 to the Romanian Health Ministry, earmarked for anti-corruption efforts.
The embassy said the ministry repeatedly failed to answer calls and letters about the offer.
Later Wednesday, two ministry officials were reportedly fired for mishandling the matter.

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Parliament (EP) refused to vote for a resolution on Albania's EU integration on Tuesday (June 1st), thus jeopardising Tirana's visa liberalisation process. 
The country's ongoing political stalemate drove the decision, the EP explained on its website. 
Adoption of the document has been postponed until the end of June. 
EP member Jelko Kacin urged the two main political parties to restart dialogue and prove they are capable of resolving the crisis. 
The opposition Socialist Party (SP) and ruling Democratic Party have been wrangling for months over the June 2009 general elections, which the SP says were manipulated.

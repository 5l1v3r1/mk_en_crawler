BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska prosecutors said Friday (11 August) that they do not have the jurisdiction to press charges against ex-Bosniak military commander Atif Dudakovic.
Under criminal legislation adopted in March 2003, war crimes cases must be handled by the BiH prosecution, they said.
Dudakovic has been accused of responsibility for atrocities shown in video footage of Croat and Bosniak paramilitary fighters apparently involved in Croatia's Operation Storm in 1995.
Meanwhile, Croatian President Stipe Mesic hailed the agreement reached among BiH, Croatian and Serbian prosecutors to collaborate in investigating war crimes during Operation Storm.
He said it was important for the three countries' judicial authorities to work together to establish the full truth.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said Saturday (January 10th) his country supports Serbia's EU perspective "without new conditions and demands".
"Only joining the EU can help Serbia break up with its traumatic past," he said in an interview for the daily Vecernje Novosti before his official visit to Belgrade.
He said also Spain supports implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Serbia and the EU "as soon as possible".
Spain will take over the EU rotating presidency in January 2010 and vows to pay particular attention to the Western Balkans', and especially Serbia's, integration.
Moratinos arrived in Belgrade on Saturday to meet Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic and other senior officials.
In other news, "wanted" posters bearing photos of Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic have appeared at police stations across the country, local media reported.
The head of Serbia's national council for ties with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said the new posters disclose after-tax rewards for information leading to the men's arrest:
1m euros for Mladic;
250,000 euros for Hadzic.

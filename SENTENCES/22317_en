SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has completed a report on measures it is planning to improve management of EU funding, media reported on Sunday (August 10th). 
The report envisions compiling a list of people, proven to have violated EU norms, as well as those under investigation. 
In addition, the cabinet will conduct new audits of two state agencies -- the road agency and the agency managing funds under the EU PHARE programme. 
A detailed report on all violations and irregularities in managing EU funding is to be prepared by September 23rd. 
The effort follows a report last month by the European Commission that criticised Bulgaria's absorption of EU funds and the functioning of the judiciary and law enforcement.

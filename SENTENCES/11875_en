LONDON, Britain -- Newcastle United routed Olympiakos 4-0 on Wednesday (16 March) to send the top Greek side out of the UEFA Cup tournament.
In the first game a week ago, the English team beat Olympiakos 3-1 in Athens.
Meanwhile, Steaua Bucharest and Spain's Villarreal ended their game in Bucharest in a goalless draw.
The two sides were to have played this match last Thursday, but bad weather forced a postponement.
CSKA Moscow and Partizan Belgrade play their UEFA Cup match late Thursday.
Their first game ended in a 1-1 draw.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik formally proposed on Monday (December 10th) that caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Spiric serve a new term as chairman of the Council of Ministers (CoM).
Spiric resigned more than a month ago to protest High Representative Miroslav Lajcak's efforts to change voting rules at CoM sessions and his refusal to give more power to the state-level prime minister.
Bosnian Serbs have since reversed their positions on that.
Dodik stressed that Spiric's candidacy enjoys broad support among parties in the ruling coalition.
Also Monday, Spiric and Lajcak met at Office of the High Representative headquarters.
They focused in part on the institutional and legislative requirements set out in the Mostar Declaration and Action Plan on Police Reform agreements.

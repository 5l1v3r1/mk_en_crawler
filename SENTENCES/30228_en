NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias urged the EU on Wednesday (April 13th) to press Turkey to change its stance in order to give momentum to the ongoing talks to reunify Cyprus.
"Turkey's intransigence is aimed at convincing the international public opinion of the need for implementation of strict timetables and arbitration, if a solution to the Cyprus problem is to be found," Christofias said after meeting with EU President Herman van Rompuy in Nicosia.
He warned that Cypriots have had bitter experience with such timetables.
Van Rompuy said the EU continues to fully support the UN-led effort to resolve the Cypriot issue as soon as possible, and encouraged leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to work in a spirit of compromise.
He promised Cyprus additional support in its fight against illegal immigration amid the crisis in Northern Africa.
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu meet again Thursday as part of the direct reunification talks.

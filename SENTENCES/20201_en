BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The relatives of war crime victims from the BiH conflict in Republika Srpska (RS) announced on Friday (December 14th) they are deeply grieved by BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic's meeting with war crimes indictee Rasim Delic on Thursday.
The group said the meeting was an insult to all victims who are not of his nationality.
RS Prime Minister Miroslav Dodik also described the reception as "absolutely unacceptable".
Local reports say Delic briefed the BiH presidency member on the developments in his trial, which is against the provisional release rules of The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY).
According to unnamed sources, the ICTY prosecution will stop former BiH Army commander Delic's temporary release because of the meeting.
Delic was granted provisional release in late November, when the ICTY decided that the retired general, who turned himself in, is co-operating with the tribunal and should be allowed to spend the holidays in Sarajevo.

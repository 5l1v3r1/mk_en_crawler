ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of protestors threw rocks and bottles at riot police outside the parliament building Tuesday (December 9th) ahead of the funeral of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old whom police shot dead on Saturday. 
The shooting triggered the country's worst street riots in decades, with dozens of people injured in clashes between protesters and police and hundreds of buildings destroyed or badly damaged. 
Late Monday, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called a cabinet crisis meeting to discuss urgent measures to restore order. 
In a TV address afterwards, he again appealed for calm and pledged to punish those responsible for the boy's death. 
Opposition parties have criticised the cabinet for failing to protect businesses and the public from the riots.
Schools and universities across Greece closed Monday and Tuesday as students joined the protests and boycotted classes.

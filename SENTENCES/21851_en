ATHENS, Greece -- Lawmakers on Thursday (October 23rd) unanimously approved a proposal establishing a panel to investigate a questionable real-estate deal between the state and the Monastery of Vatopedi.
All five parties in parliament supported the move.
Main opposition PASOK leader George Papandreou has accused the ruling New Democracy Party of trying to cover up the case after two prosecutors investigating the deal resigned.
Prosecutors Ilias Koliousis and Eleni Sotiropoulou said they found evidence connecting the case to two deputy ministers but that their superior blocked their attempt to turn their investigation over to parliament.
Preliminary findings suggest deals resulted in at least 100m euros in losses to the state.
Merchant Marine Minister George Voulgarakis resigned in September for his alleged involvement.

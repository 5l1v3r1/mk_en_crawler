ANKARA, Turkey -- Officials on Saturday (19 August) blamed a huge explosion at a natural gas pipeline on terrorists from the Kurdistan Workers Party.
The pipeline brings vast quantities of natural gas to Turkey from Iran.
Ankara was studying the possibility of extending the facility to Western Europe.
An energy ministry spokesman said gas deliveries have been suspended while firefighters battle the blaze.
In other news, a prosecutor has indicted the author of a biography of Kemal Ataturk's wife for offending the memory of the founder of modern Turkey.
Ipek Calislar faces up to four and a half years in prison for writing that Ataturk once avoided an assassination attempt by leaving his home disguised as a woman.

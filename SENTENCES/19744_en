ANKARA, Turkey -- A spokesman for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan sought Wednesday (August 22nd) to soften a comment by the prime minister that sparked broad public criticism. 
On Monday, Erdogan reacted to a columnist for the daily Hurriyet who said he could not accept Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as president because of the candidate's roots in political Islam. 
"People who say that â¦ must renounce their citizenship," Erdogan said. 
"You're this country's citizen, the president is your president, and the prime minister is your prime minister."
On Wednesday, Erdogan's spokesman said the prime minister has "never appreciated the approach of love it or leave it".

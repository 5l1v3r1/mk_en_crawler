SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The first war crimes trial in BiH began Wednesday (14 September) against a former Bosnian Serb paramilitary soldier, Boban Simsic, who is charged with committing crimes against Bosniak civilians in 1992 in Visegrad.
Simsic, 38, surrendered in January.
The Office of the High Representative described the trial as a further step forward in the establishment of strong and independent institutions in BiH.
Also Wednesday, US prosecutors announced indictments against 13 Bosnian Serbs for failing to declare that they had served in the Bosnian Serb Army when they sought asylum in the United States.
Seven other men have been arrested on similar charges.
Many of the indictees come from the Srebrenica area.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reiterated Kosovo's opposition to a tentative agreement EULEX has struck with Belgrade, after meeting with EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon on Thursday (August 20th).
They said Pristina will not approve any signing of the protocol on police co-operation.
De Kermabon did not specify whether he will sign this protocol, as he is still working on the draft.
Also unclear is whether it would require the approval of Kosovo institutions.

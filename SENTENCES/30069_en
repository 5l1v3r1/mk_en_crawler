BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said on Thursday (January 20th) that there is no need for an additional prosecutor to investigate allegations made by Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty, since the EULEX Mission already has independent prosecutors working in the area. 
Ashton was responding to a request from Human Rights Watch that the EU name an independent prosecutor to probe Marty's allegations of human organs trafficking. 
Ashton also says there should be more evidence from Marty before any new investigation could be launched, Radio Free Europe reports. 
Any prosecutor, she says, has to base investigations on evidence admissible in court. 
"If indeed Marty, or anybody else, has found substantial evidence of criminal activities, we do encourage him to bring those forward to the appropriate authorities, including EULEX," Ashton stated.

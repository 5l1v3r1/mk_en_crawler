BELGRADE, Serbia -- The justice ministry has forwarded to Bosnian authorities a request to extend the extradition detention of Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda, Justice Minister Snezana Malovic announced on Friday (January 21st).
The move should give Belgrade enough time to prepare all documents needed for the extradition.
Croatian authorities decided not to seek it, saying it lacked the evidence to open a criminal investigation against him.
Purda, who fought in the eastern town of Vukovar, was detained earlier this month at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on a Serbian arrest warrant.
Authorities in Belgrade suspect him of involvement in war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar early in the war.
On Friday, BiH extended Purda's extradition detention by 22 days, at Serbia's request.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said Tuesday (18 January) that the UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutors have briefed the government on the tribunal's activities regarding the 2001 interethnic conflict.
Local media has been reporting that the prosecutors plan to indict former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski this week, in connection with a deadly police operation against ethnic Albanians in Ljuboten in the summer of 2001.
Buckovski says Hague prosecutors have told the justice ministry that no indictment has been issued, but that the investigation into the Ljuboten case continues.
Boskovski, who has dual Macedonian-Croatian citizenship, remains in custody in Croatia, where he was arrested on separate charges in August.

LUXEMBOURG -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte met with EU justice ministers Monday (14 October), telling reporters afterwards that the European alliance should put more pressure on the Yugoslav government to arrest and extradite former Bosnian wartime commander Ratko Mladic. 
She said that the general continues to enjoy the protection of the Yugoslav Army and reiterated that prosecutors are aware of his exact whereabouts in Serbia. 
The EU justice ministers agreed to step up the exchange of information on war crimes and to go after lesser suspects, many of whom are now living in the West.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday unsealed the indictment against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
The UN court said the aim was to ensure a swift trial if he is arrested. 
The amended indictment, issued in May 2000, reduces the number of counts to ten and covers only the most serious offences, including genocide.

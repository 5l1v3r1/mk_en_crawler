SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes trial against former Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic has been postponed until Thursday (May 8th), after the defendant refused to leave his cell and attend the start of the trial Tuesday, implying its outcome was pre-determined. 
"My presence is not necessary for this formality," Klickovic said in a statement to the court. 
Judge Zoran Bozic decided to try again Thursday, as long as Klickovic's lawyers are in court. 
He is the highest-ranking member of former Republika Srpska President Radovan Karadzic's administration to stand trial. 
Banja Luka accuses him of abuse of office and of embezzling funds from the entity's budget from 1997 to 1998 to help war crimes fugitives. 
He is also charged in connection with abetting murders and the deportation of civilians in the northwest Krajina region from 1990 to 1992.

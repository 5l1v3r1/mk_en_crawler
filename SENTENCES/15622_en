BELGRADE, Serbia â Briefing Belgrade's Second Municipal Court on Wednesday (October 25th), prosecutors said they want to investigate five more people suspected of aiding fugitive Ratko Mladic between June 2002 and January 2006.
They also asked that the proceedings remain closed to the public.
Eleven others, including several former Yugoslav and Republika Srpska officers, have already been charged with helping Mladic evade justice.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana visited Pristina on Tuesday (28 September) and urged all residents of Kosovo to vote in next month's general elections -- including the Serb community, which has threatened a boycott. 
Solana also warned that talks on the final status of Kosovo would not begin until the province has met a set of internationally established standards.
In other news, Kosovo and Serbian officials agreed at a Kosovo Contact Group meeting in Vienna that measures must be taken to improve security of Serbs in Kosovo. 
"Albanians and Serbs said the same thing: that security is a very important issue. 
Movement was made because the Albanians recognise that it is an issue," said Charles English of the US State Department. 
Participants failed, however, to reach agreement on a single decentralisation plan for Kosovo.

PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops conducted another raid Thursday (13 October) in a bid to crack on war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic's support network.
A store allegedly owned by Karadzic's son-in-law was searched and some equipment and documents were seized, in hopes of finding information about the network protecting the fugitive.
The action was carried out in Pale, where most of the Karadzic family lives.

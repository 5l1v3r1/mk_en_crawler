BUCHAREST, Romania -- The frontrunner in the weekend presidential run-off, Mircea Geoana of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) says Romania can expect a new government before Christmas.
On Tuesday (December 1st), he said the new cabinet would be "competent and fair", rather than serve party interests.
A coalition between the PSD and the National Liberal Party (PNL) means Geoana will likely defeat incumbent President Traian Basescu on Sunday, clearing the way to announce cabinet picks that are already being negotiated.
The PSD and the PNL control 65% of all parliamentary seats, and have managed to gain the support of smaller parties as well, including the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians and the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party.
Meanwhile, police reportedly used tear gas Tuesday after fighting erupted at a PSD rally in Timisoara.
As many as 3,000 people turned out for Geoana's campaign appearance, outside the city's opera theatre.
Trouble started when opponents of the party arrived, prompting police to separate the two groups.
The rally coincided with celebrations of Romania's National Day.
In Bucharest, about 10,000 people attended a military parade.

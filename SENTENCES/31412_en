PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Parliament opened debate Tuesday (28 January) on the new constitution of the future union with Serbia.
Discussions on it and an accompanying implementation law will continue Wednesday.
Parliament Speaker Filip Vujanovic urged the deputies to adopt the constitution.
But opposition lawmakers who favour closer ties with Serbia voiced fears that the ruling party would press ahead with a referendum on independence soon.
Under the EU-brokered deal, Montenegro will be free to leave the union after three years.
Passed by Serbia's Parliament on Monday, the constitution must also be approved by the Federal Parliament.
In other news, a new poll suggests next month's repeat vote for president of Montenegro will fail due to low voter turnout, as did the first attempt in December.
By law, a minimum of 50 per cent of voters must cast ballots.

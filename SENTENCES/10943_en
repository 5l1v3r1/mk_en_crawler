WASHINGTON, United States -- Croatia is optimistic about launching accession talks with the EU in the autumn, Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic told a gathering at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Voice of America reported Friday (29 July). 
Grabar-Kitarovic said that Zagreb is doing everything in its power to track down fugitive General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN tribunal's top three most wanted men. 
Croatia's failure to arrest him prompted the postponement of negotiations with the EU in March. 
Grabar-Kitarovic said her government is making a genuine effort that should be taken into account by UN prosecutors and the EU. 
As for her meeting with US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns, Grabar-Kitarovic said they had a "very open dialogue" covering bilateral and regional issues, the fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

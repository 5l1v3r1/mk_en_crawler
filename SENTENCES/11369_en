BUCHAREST, Romania -- Key new legislation on judicial reforms and property rights comes into force in Romania on Monday (25 July), after having been promulgated in the Official Monitor at the end of last week. 
The legislative package is aimed at making the domestic judiciary independent and more efficient, as well as simplifying property restitution procedures in the country. 
Its enactment was one of the commitments undertaken by the government under the EU accession process.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry announced on Monday (January 31st) that it is sending a government aircraft to evacuate Bulgarians from Egypt, which has been the scene of unprecedented massive protests against the rule of President Hosni Mubarak for a week now. 
At least 102 people have been killed since the protests began. 
On Sunday, Greece and Turkey also began evacuating their citizens. 
Cyprus, meanwhile, opened its airports to planes transporting evacuees from Cairo. 
The first flights carrying citizens of Canada, the US, Germany, the Netherlands, China and the UK arrived on the island Monday.
Greece said on Monday it is concerned the crisis in Egypt may lead to a fresh wave of illegal immigrants trying to cross into Europe through its borders. 
Citizen Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis said security along the border with Turkey has been beefed up.

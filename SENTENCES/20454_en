BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic are meeting on Monday (February 11th) to discuss the current political crisis.
Local media cast the meeting as the last chance to keep the ruling coalition intact.
Analysts say chances for reconciliation are minimal.
The major ruling coalition parties -- Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) and Kostunica's Democratic Party (DSS) -- agree regarding Kosovo's final status issue, but disagree about the importance of Serbia's EU integration.
Tadic insists that there is no point in self-isolation and that the country must continue towards EU membership.
Kostunica says that Serbia must be cautious and should not sign an interim political agreement offered by the EU, because it would represent indirect recognition of Kosovo's independence.
In a comment for Vecernji Novosti, DS member Dulic said early parliamentary elections are one option.

ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of people who work at the finance ministry and customs agency rallied in Athens on Wednesday (February 17th) against austerity measures aimed at slashing government spending. 
The protestors argue the current financial crisis was not caused by state employees, so they should not be paying to fix it. 
Employees of finance and customs are striking this week against measures to freeze their salaries and cut monthly bonuses.
Also Wednesday, Prime Minister George Papandreou summoned his cabinet for an informal session to brief them on measures the government plans to undertake. 
The effort, aimed at bringing Athens' finances in check within three years, was supported by the EU finance ministers Tuesday. 
It envisions slashing the country's huge budget deficit by 4% this year, with more measures to come.

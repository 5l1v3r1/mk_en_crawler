BUCHAREST, Romania -- The new left-centrist government coalition on Friday (December 19th) asked incumbent Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu to remain in the post.
His nomination came after intensive talks within the alliance of the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Liberal Party, which lasted until late on Friday, ahead of a no-confidence vote in parliament on Monday.
Prediou, 40, a member of the National Liberal Party, took over the justice ministry in March, after predecessor Tudor Chiuariu resigned amid corruption allegations.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) says Mladen Ivanic should remain BiH foreign minister until parliament decides on the next step.
Prime Minister Adnan Terzic recently dismissed Ivanic -- invoking a resignation offer from six months earlier -- because of a dispute over who should head the country's intelligence agency.
Ivanic's choice for the post was eventually backed by the OHR.

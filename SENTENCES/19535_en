ANKARA, Turkey -- Ten Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists and two Turkish soldiers were killed in armed clashes in southeast Turkey on Saturday (August 25th).
One soldier was wounded.
Fighting has been under way for three days in the province of Sirnak, near the border with Iraq.
Military sources say a growing number of PKK guerillas based in northern Iraq are trying to cross the border with Turkey, forcing the army to strengthen its position in the region.

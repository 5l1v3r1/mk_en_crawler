MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- About 300 Serbs blocked the bridge dividing the ethnic Albanian and Serb parts of Mitrovica on Monday (13 June) to prevent the reopening of the road that links the two parts of the city. 
The province's UN administration had planned to reopen the bridge for traffic for the first time since the end of the 1999 conflict. 
A spokesman for the UN said the international administrators understood the Serbs' concerns but were committed to ensuring freedom of movement in the province. 
The tentative reopening of the bridge came hours before the arrival of Kai Eide, a UN envoy sent to Kosovo to assess its readiness to begin negotiations on its final status.

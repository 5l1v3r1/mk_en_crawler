SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH will discuss the case of war crimes convict Branimir Glavas on September 20th, court spokesperson Selma Hadzic said on Saturday (September 11th).
A Croatian politician and former lawmaker, Glavas was sentenced in July to eight years in prison for war crimes against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict.
Glavas, who holds both Croatian and Bosnian citizenship, left Croatia last year for neighbouring BiH to avoid prison.

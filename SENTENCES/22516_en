ATHENS, Greece -- A powerful earthquake killed two and injured at least 192 as it rattled the Peloponnese peninsula in western Greece on Sunday (June 8th), according to the latest information published by Greek media on Monday. 
The quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale and was strongest in and around the city of Patras. 
Rescue teams continue to search for survivors. 
Residents also felt the quake in the town of Ioannina, the village of Gardiki and the region of Attica near the capital, as well as in southern Italy. 
Seismologists in Athens believe that the quake was very close to the earth's surface -- about 10km below ground -- sparking concerns about strong aftershocks. 
The Athens Geodynamic Institute announced that eight measuring more than 4.0 on the Richter scale have occurred so far.
Many old buildings in Ahaia, Ilia, Andravida, Amaliada, Pyrgos and Patras suffered damage. 
Buildings cracked at the military airport in Andravida , but it continues to function. 
Many places have no electricity. 
Authorities have warned residents to avoid entering cracked buildings and evacuated many villages and towns for that reason.
The government has announced it will pay 3,000 euros to each person affected by the earthquake, especially those who lost their homes. 
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis is cutting short a trip to Vienna and returning home.

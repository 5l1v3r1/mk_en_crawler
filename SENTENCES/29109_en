ATHENS, Greece -- Voters head to the polls Sunday (November 7th) for municipal elections described as a referendum on the policies -- particularly the austerity programme -- of Prime Minister George Papandreou and his cabinet. 
Papandreou threatened on Saturday that snap elections could be called if voters fail to back the measures Sunday. 
In an interview with the newspaper Ta Nea, he described the vote as an opportunity for the public to demonstrate whether they choose stability or "further adventures". 
He also warned that if the cabinet fails to receive necessary support, it would undermine Greece's credibility. 
"The worst thing we could do is to send a signal that there is a U-turn," Papandreou said. 
Sunday's local and regional races are the first electoral challenge for the PASOK government, which came to power in October 2009. 
Run-offs are scheduled for November 14th.

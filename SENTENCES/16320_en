BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Party (PD) has decided to withdraw Deputy Prime Minister Gheorghe Pogea from the Romanian cabinet, in a bid to force the government to restructure. 
To underline the need for such restructuring, PD will not nominate anyone else to the post, party leader Emil Boc explained.
The other parties in the ruling coalition have mixed opinions. 
Conservatives agree that some ministries should get restructured, while the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania say a personnel reshuffle is enough.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia reversed its decision on Thursday (December 9th) to boycott the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo honouring Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo and announced it was sending a representative.
Friday's ceremony will be attended by Ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, as a special representative of the prime minister.
By initially declining the invitation, Serbia broke with the 27 member states of the EU, prompting criticism from the Union and questions about Serbia's eventual accession.
The initial response also sparked criticism from several Serbian political parties and NGOs.
Explaining the decision, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic had said that although Serbia respected human rights, relations with China were more important.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decided on Tuesday (July 8th) that the 10% electoral threshold in Turkey does not constitute a violation of human rights.
Thirteen judges of the Grand Chamber upheld the ruling, while four opposed it.
With the decision, the court rejects an appeal filed in 2003 by two former Turkish lawmakers from the dissolved Democratic People's Party (DEHAP), which claimed the electoral threshold violates European human rights law.
In other news, Turkish media reported Tuesday that the justice ministry has appointed two inspectors to investigate the death of businessman Kuddisi Okkir, whom police detained during a probe of a hard-line group suspected of plotting a coup.
Okkir, incarcerated for 13 months, died of cancer on Sunday, six days after a hospital began treating him.
His wife claims delays in diagnosis and treatment led to his death.

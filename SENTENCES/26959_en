STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- EU presidency holder Sweden announced on Friday (October 2nd) that the Union and the United States will convene a meeting with leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in Sarajevo on October 9th, in an effort to overcome the stubborn political stalemate in the country.
The EU and the US want to work together to support BiH's Euro-Atlantic ambitions, Sweden said in a statement, noting that Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg have decided to call the meeting to encourage political dialogue in the country.
The current situation is affecting the pace of reforms, resulting in BiH lagging behind other countries in the region, the statement said.

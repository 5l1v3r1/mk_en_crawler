BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers resumed their normal workload on Wednesday (September 3rd) with a debate on ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
Signed in April, its ratification has been stalled by dissension within parliament. 
Parliamentary sessions were suspended in July after days of obstruction by the opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and Democratic Party of Serbia.
After the summer recess, the SRS finally agreed to observe the initial agenda. 
Ratification of the SAA is a first step the country must take before it can receive EU candidate status.

In early May, Zagreb's Technical Museum unveiled the country's first Lego exhibition. 
By the time it closed 45 days later on Sunday (June 27th), 30,000 people had visited it.
The young were impressed with the colourful bricks and constructions, while their parents enjoyed the nostalgia. 
Legos turned 50 this year.
"The response was great and we were surprised to see how many came to visit the exhibition," Matija Grguric, Lego ambassador to Croatia and president of the Croatian Lego Club Kockice [Bricks] told SETimes.
He exhibited a model of the Zagreb Arts Pavilion, the yellow-coloured landmark of the city's centre that he constructed with Legos. 
It took more than 25,000 bricks and a year and a half to complete the work. 
Grguric has been a Lego fan since childhood.
"I took my three-year old daughter to the exhibition because I'd like her to share my enthusiasm for Legos ... 
You can build whatever you want by carefully planning and constructing the bricks and the outcome is really sensational," one visitor told SETimes.
"Legos are special; they do not change much over the years. 
The principle is always the same and its creativity attracts all generations. 
You don't have to be technically talented to be a good Lego builder. 
It is great to see grandparents and grandchildren together building with Lego bricks," says Grguric, an architecture graduate.
The oldest member of the Croatian Lego club is over 60, while the youngest is just 7.
Club members presented their work in the form of Lego buildings, cars, film scenes and fairy tale scenes.

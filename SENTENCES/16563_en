PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic began consulting with political parties Monday (10 July), to set a date for the next parliamentary and local elections. 
By law, he must announce the date by the beginning of August. 
The next election must take place by 5 October. 
On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court is expected to rule on whether a new law on minority rights and freedoms complies with Montenegro's election legislation. 
If not, differences would have to be reconciled, requiring extra time before Election Day.

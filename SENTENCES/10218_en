PARIS, France -- President Jacques Chirac told the French cabinet on Wednesday (27 October) that it is "in the interests of France and Europe that Turkey can in the long term join the EU", adding that this would require "considerable effort â€¦ and a lot of time".
During a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week, Chirac said he would back the launch of accession talks with Ankara.
The EU is set to decide on the issue at its summit in December.

TIRANA, Albania -- The leader of the opposition Party of Social Democracy (PSD), Paskal Milo, urged President Alfred Moisiu on Friday (18 August) to mediate the resumption of political dialogue in the country.
Milo suggested that Moisiu convene a roundtable of parties in parliament to resolve the ongoing impasse.
Last week, the major opposition Socialist Party announced that it would boycott the winter municipal elections unless the parliamentary majority complies with its demands for electoral reform.

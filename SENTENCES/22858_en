ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian People's Party (HNS) is set to elect its new leader today (April 6th.) More than 1,500 delegates will gather at the party's 9th electoral congress to choose between three candidates for the post -- Radmir Cacic, Antun Kapraljevic and Josip Posavac.
One of the candidates will replace Vesna Pusic, who withdrew from the leadership of the party after eight years at its helm and nominated Radmir Cacic as her successor.
Cacic, who is former chairman of the party's Central Committee, is supported by the committee and is viewed as the likely winner in today's vote.

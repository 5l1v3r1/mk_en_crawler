BERLIN, Germany -- Transparency International has awarded Milica Bisic, former head of the tax department in Republika Srpska, one of its 2004 Integrity awards.
She "fearlessly took on corruption in this system, clamping down on those benefiting from a shadow economy by refusing to pay their share of taxes", the organisation said in a statement.
It also honoured posthumously Hasan Balikci, a Turkish electrical engineer murdered for his efforts to root out corruption in the state electricity company.

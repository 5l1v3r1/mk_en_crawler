SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Greek Ambassador to Macedonia Alexandra Papadopoulou on Monday (March 29th) condemned nationalist slogans chanted during a military parade in Athens. 
She was summoned to the Macedonian Foreign Ministry where Deputy Foreign Minister Zoran Petrov demanded a formal apology. 
"It should be condemned and it is being condemned. 
It doesn't represent the people of Greece, its position and mentality," Papadopoulou told reporters after the meeting. 
Greek personnel allegedly chanted "They are Skopjans, they are Albanians, we will make new clothes out of their skins" during a parade marking Greece's national holiday last Thursday.

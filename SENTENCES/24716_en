TIRANA, Albania -- A court in Tirana on Tuesday (March 3rd) fined Deputy Prime Minister Genc Pollo 2,300 euros for slander. 
In 2007, Pollo, who served as education minister at the time, accused the publisher of the newspaper Standard, Arjan Cukaj, of using the media to win a licence to open a private university. 
The court ruled the minister's claims were false and that he used abusive language to address the businessman. 
Cukaj incurred another fine of about 830 euros for using inappropriate language towards Pollo. 
This marks the first time an Albanian court has fined a member of the government.

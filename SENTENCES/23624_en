TIRANA, Albania -- Doris Pack, head of the European Parliament's committee for southeast Europe, said on Friday (March 20th) that Albania was not ready for EU accession.
"Albania has a long way to go before joining the EU, and it has to continue working to fulfil the EU conditions in all fields," Pack said at the end of her official visit to Tirana.
She encouraged Albanian politicians to continue their efforts to meet European standards, noting that holding free and democratic elections in June would be essential to the country's EU bid.
Albania is scheduled to join NATO early next month.

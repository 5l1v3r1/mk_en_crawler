BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Wednesday (December 26th) that the media misinterpreted a statement by war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic concerning the whereabouts of fugitive Ratko Mladic.
News reports had quoted Vukcevic as saying Mladic is in Serbia, while fellow fugitive Radovan Karadzic is in the region.
According to Ljajic, however, the prosecutor "did not say Mladic was in Serbia on the basis of operational data.
We are working as if Mladic is in Serbia, but at this point, no one can claim whether or not he is in the territory." (B92, Tanjug - 26/12/07;

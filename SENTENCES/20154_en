TIRANA, Albania -- After formally accepting the resignation of Justice Minister Ilir Rusmajli, Prime Minister Sali Berisha proposed on Thursday (November 15th) that his legal adviser, Enkeled Alibeaj, take over the justice ministry. 
Alibeaj, 34, says his main task would be to complete judicial system reforms. 
He must be approved by both President Bamir Topi and parliament. 
Rusmajli stepped down on Wednesday amid corruption allegations.
Meanwhile, the Makfax agency announced that the Albanian government has decided to extend the list of people banned from investing in Albania because of alleged links to terrorist organisations. 
Six more names were added, for a total of 42.

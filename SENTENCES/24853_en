TIRANA, Albania -- While the government still plans to submit the country's application for EU candidate status during the current Czech EU presidency, Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Monday (March 2nd) did not rule out possible delays in the process due to the EU's internal problems.
"Albania will have to wait but not for long," he told members of the ruling Democratic Party.
Berisha praised the fast ratification of Albania's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU by all 27 Union member states.
He credited the country's progress in fighting crime and corruption.
In other news, parliament's foreign policy committee adopted five draft laws representing the basis of Albania's NATO membership.
The full parliament is expected to adopt them soon.
Separately Monday, US Ambassador to Tirana John Withers called on Albanian magistrates to resist political pressure and guarantee judicial independence.
"There is nothing more important than a free and honest justice system," he told a meeting of the country's heads of courts.

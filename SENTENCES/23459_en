TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi signed several decrees Thursday (March 26th) on Albania's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
Parliament passed them earlier in the day, completing the legal framework for NATO membership, expected to become effective next week at the Alliance summit.
Separately Thursday, OSCE Ambassador to Tirana Robert Bosch visited Gerdec and said his organisation will help Albania dismantle and destroy old ammunition.
Bosch said that by assisting, the OSCE will prevent accidents similar to explosions a year ago that killed 26 people and injured hundreds.

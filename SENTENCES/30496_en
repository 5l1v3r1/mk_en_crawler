ANKARA, Turkey -- The Chief Prosecutor's Office announced on Wednesday (May 11th) it found no evidence of cheating during the national university entrance exam administered in March.
The statement came after organisers of the exams admitted to flaws in the system.
The scandal broke out after codes were discovered that seemed to allow students to determine the right answers without solving the problems.
Prosecutors recommend investigating the head of the examination board, Ali Demir, and other officials for neglect of duty.
Demir denies any cheating took place.
A court in Ankara is to decide soon, possibly Thursday, whether that first round of the exam in March should be nullified.
A second round is scheduled for June.

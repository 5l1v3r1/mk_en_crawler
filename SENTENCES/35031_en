BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said on Tuesday (29 June) that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal will now resume.
"The fact is that we had an interruption .
for the simple reason that there was a round of elections in Serbia," he said, adding that co-operation would include the transfer of indictees.
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has said all investigations would be wrapped by the end of the year, resulting in six more indictments against 11 individuals.
She indicated that some would be prosecuted jointly, as co-defendants.

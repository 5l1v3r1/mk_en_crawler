BERLIN, Germany -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier agreed that KFOR's presence remains crucial to Kosovo.
Troops should remain there to guarantee the co-existence of the Albanian majority and the Serbian minority, de Hoop Scheffer said after the meeting in Berlin, where they discussed global military missions.
Steinmeier expressed hope that ongoing negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, mediated by the EU-Russia-US troika, would result in a compromise on Kosovo's final status.

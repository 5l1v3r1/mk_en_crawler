THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (March 17th) reduced the sentence of former Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajisnik from 27 to 20 years in prison after cancelling the counts convicting him of the murder, extermination and persecution of non-Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict. 
However, the Appeals Chamber upheld the earlier sentence convicting Krajisnik of "deportation, forcible transfer and persecution based on these crimes". 
The new sentence will take into account the time Krajisnik has spent in custody since April 2000. 
He was considered former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic's right hand during the conflict.

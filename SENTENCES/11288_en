BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Local media reports Thursday (24 March) quoted EU security chief Javier Solana as saying the Democratic Party (DS) should join the Serbian government. 
Solana met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and President Boris Tadic in Brussels earlier this week, calling for them to accept Tadic's party in the cabinet. 
There are reports that some preliminary talks are under way, though no details have been released.
Also Thursday, Kostunica expressed confidence over prospects for a positive EU feasibility study on the stabilisation and association process. 
He predicted that the biggest obstacle, war crimes co-operation, would be resolved.

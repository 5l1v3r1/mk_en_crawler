LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- In a surprise move, parliament failed to ratify neighbouring Croatia's entry into NATO on Thursday (January 29th).
A delay was requested by former Prime Minister Janez Jansa's Slovenian Democrat Party (SDS), which suddenly announced it won't back the ratification.
Although the ruling coalition in Slovenia backs ratification, a two thirds majority is required, which means the SDS votes are needed.
Due to parliamentary regulations, a new vote is at least two weeks away.
Prime Minister Borut Pahor was visibly disappointed with the latest development, saying he didn't see how Slovenia's interests are served by Croatia and Albania remaining outside of NATO.

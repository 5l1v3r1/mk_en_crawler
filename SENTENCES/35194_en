ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul reiterated on Sunday (22 February) the official government stance that the resolution of the Cyprus dispute is not connected to Turkey's EU accession bid.
Asked whether a positive outcome to negotiations on Cyprus would speed up the accession process, Gul said the two issues are unrelated.
But last week he said that Kofi Annan's peace plan for Cyprus would not be properly implemented if Turkey were not on its way to EU membership.

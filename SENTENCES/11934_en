LONDON, Britain -- British troops seized 27kg of heroin, worth more than $12m, on the first day of an operation against crime in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Using tactics perfected in Northern Ireland and Iraq, the unit surrounded a car that had stopped at a roadblock near a bridge linking BiH and Montenegro.
The driver surrendered and was taken away by helicopter.
In other news, with the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords approaching, Russia -- as one of the guarantor states for implementation of the accord -- will propose that the Office of the High Representative be transformed into an EU Office in BiH.
Russian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Vladimir Cizov discussed the idea Thursday during a meeting with BiH Presidency Chairman Borislav Paravac in Sarajevo.

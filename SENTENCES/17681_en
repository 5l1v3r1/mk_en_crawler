BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik denounced on Sunday (March 25th) the decision by Srebrenica municipal councillors to begin seeking special status for the town, outside of RS jurisdiction.
Dodik says this would directly violate the RS Constitution.
He warned that the entity government would not hesitate to take legal action to defend its rights.
Bosniak politicians began demanding special status after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that genocide was committed against Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995.
In other news Sunday, international community High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling told the Nezavisne Novine newspaper that he is not pessimistic about the possibility of BiH's two entities reaching an agreement on key police reforms.
He noted that, in principle, Dodik has agreed on state-level control over police forces, a sticking point now for months.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Technical preparations for reopening the fourth unit at the Kozloduy nuclear plant are under way, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Friday (January 16th). 
He added Bulgaria would launch the unit only in co-ordination with the EU, though he did not specify when or how this would happen. 
The government decided to proceed in light of the ongoing natural gas crisis. 
But that may end this week, following an agreement Russia and Ukraine struck late Saturday. 
As Bulgaria's power system had not come under threat and as electricity exports have continued during the crisis, the European Commission has indicated it does not approve any restarting of Unit Four.

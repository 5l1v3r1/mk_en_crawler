SPLIT, Croatia -- Families of the killed victims vowed Sunday (24 November) to file an appeal with the International Court in Strasbourg, France, following the acquittals of eight military police officers accused of 1992 war crimes in the Lora prison.
A panel of judges in Split ruled in favour of the defendants Friday (22 November).
An association of Montenegrin soldiers called the proceeding a "farce".
Two NGOs held a press conference in Split on Sunday, citing irregularities in the trial.
Officials from the Centre for Development of Democracy and the Altruist said testimony was manipulated to present the officers as national heroes.

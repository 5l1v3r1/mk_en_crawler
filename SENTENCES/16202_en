ANKARA, Turkey -- A gunman stormed into a meeting at Turkey's highest administrative court, the Council of State, on Wednesday (17 May) and opened fire, wounding five judges, the Ankara governor's office said.
The attacker, a lawyer who was detained, reportedly chanted, "God is Greatest!" as he fired his weapon, private NTV television reported, citing witnesses.
The governor's office said two of the five judges were in critical condition.
In other news, the editor of an Armenian-Turkish newspaper went on trial in Istanbul on Tuesday on charges of attempting to influence the judiciary.
Hrant Dink, a Turkish citizen, ran articles in his Agos newspaper, which criticised a law that made it a criminal offence to "insult Turkishness".
Three other journalists from the same newspaper are on trial on similar charges.

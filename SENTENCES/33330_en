BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- According to British Ambassador to Belgrade Charles Crawford and NATO official George Katsirdakis, two conditions need to be met for Serbia to enter NATO's Partnership for Peace programme (PfP).
The country must fully co-operate with the war crimes tribunal and must drop its case against NATO members, relating to the 1999 military action.
Speaking Friday (6 June) in Belgrade, the two officials called for Belgrade authorities to shed more light on state institutions' protection of war crimes indictees.
Katsirdakis added that the case of former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic remains a major obstacle.
Crawford and Katsirdakis agreed that entry into the PfP could be expected in a couple of weeks if all conditions are met.

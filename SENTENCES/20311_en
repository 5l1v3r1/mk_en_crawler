ISTANBUL, Turkey -- At least 40 people were injured when a passenger ferry collided with a Ukrainian ship in the Bosporus Strait on Monday (August 13th).
A spokesman for the Turkish coast guard said traffic on one of the world's busiest waterways was not affected by the accident.
The ferry made it to port, where all passengers were taken off.
Local media reported later that none of the injuries were life-threatening.
There were 448 people aboard the ferry, which operates out of the town of Yenikapi, 110km southwest of Istanbul.
According to initial reports, the Ukrainian ship was anchored when the ferry struck it.

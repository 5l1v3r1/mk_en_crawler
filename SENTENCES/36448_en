BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The National Council for Co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia wants information from the federal foreign ministry about progress in the cases involving four indicted generals, said the council's chairman, Rasim Ljajic, after its session on Wednesday (11 August).
He said the ministry must obtain this information from the Belgrade District Court, which has jurisdiction over the cases.
Prosecutors at The Hague are seeking the extradition of retired generals Nebojsa Pavkovic, Vladimir Lazarevic, Sreten Lukic and Vlastimir Djordjevic.
They have been indicted for crimes committed against Kosovo Albanians in 1998 and 1999.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN special envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer is telling both Turkey and Greece that 2009 will be the last chance to reunify Cyprus, according to media reports Sunday (December 21st).
During visits to Ankara and Athens last week, Downer said the UN could scrap its efforts if the Cypriot leaders fail to reach an agreement by the end of next year.
Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat is ineligible to run in the 2010 presidential elections in northern Cyprus, further hampering reunification efforts.
"The UN would be forced to start all over again, but it is already tired of the Cyprus problem," he said.
"Everybody should know that this is the last chance.
Either this problem will be solved or the island will be divided forever," Downer was quoted as telling Turkish officials.
He confirmed that progress has been made in ongoing talks but described the pace as "very slow".

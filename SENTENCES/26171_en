NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The UN Security Council voted on Monday (December 14th) to extend by six months the mandate of its peacekeeping mission in Cyprus, the UNFICYP, until June 15th, 2010.
The vote was 14 to 1, with Turkey the sole dissenter.
The resolution also urged Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on the divided island to resolve their long-standing dispute and reunify Cyprus, under UN-mediated talks that began more than a year ago.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic confirmed on Thursday (February 14th) that the presidency has lost the original copy of the Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Komsic said the presidency discovered it was missing from its archives and has no idea how or when it disappeared. 
Investigators are working on the case and prosecutors are joining the search.
"I don't know if the news is more sad or funny, but I do know that the other original copy of the Dayton Agreement is located in Paris," High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said.

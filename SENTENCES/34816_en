BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During his recent visit to Washington, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic offered to send Serbian troops to join peacekeeping missions.
The proposal was made in an interview with CNN on Tuesday (5 August).
Zivkovic affirmed the country's readiness to help the United States as a strategic partner and said it was willing to extend peacekeeping participation beyond Iraq.
He added, however, that such decisions would need to be made by union authorities.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Both presidential and local elections will be announced by the end of the year, regardless of whether there is agreement reached within the ruling coalition, Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic said on Saturday (September 8th).
Officials in Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party have called for elections to be postponed until after the final status of Kosovo is resolved, but Dulic says life in Serbia cannot grind to a halt due to Kosovo.

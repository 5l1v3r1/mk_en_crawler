STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- The government decided on Thursday (October 22nd) to release former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic on October 27th. 
Last month, The Hague war crimes tribunal approved her early release, now that she has served two-thirds of her 11-year sentence. 
Plavsic was convicted in 2003 after pleading guilty to a single count of persecution, a crime against humanity, as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive Muslims and Croats out of Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi signed a decree Tuesday (September 21st) to appoint Judge Bashkim Dedja as the new head of the Constitutional Court, ending a two-month row with the government.
Topi's office says it was following procedures but the cabinet insisted it wanted a fully functioning court since it is negotiating with the opposition Socialist Party to decide on further steps regarding the disputed 2009 general elections.
Dedja became a member of the Constitutional Court only four months ago, due to a vacancy.
His promotion requires parliamentary approval.
By law, appointees need 50%+1 of the votes.

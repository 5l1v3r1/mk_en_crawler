VIDIN, Bulgaria -- Following years of delay, construction of a second bridge over the Danube between Bulgaria and Romania finally began on Sunday (May 13th).
Speaking at the ceremony in Vidin, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said the bridge would be completed within 36 months, under the helm of the Spanish company FCC.
Stanishev stressed that the EU-supported project, which will cost 236m euros, is one of the country's biggest infrastructure initiatives yet and represents an important part of the trans-European Corridor 4 route.

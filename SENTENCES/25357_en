BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday (November 24th) upheld the sentences handed to the killers of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
The court turned down the appeals of Milorad Ulemek and Zvezdan Jovanovic, both of whom were sentenced to 40 years in prison.
Belgrade's Special Court for Organised Crime convicted the two in May 2007.
"The Supreme Court has determined that ...
the sentences were passed according to the law," the court said in a statement.
Tuesday's decision means that the two have no other venues in which to appeal.
Djindjic was killed on March 12th 2003.
Judges have concluded that Ulemek, a former commander of the notorious special police unit known as the Red Berets, orchestrated the sniper attack, while Jovanovic pulled the trigger.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Charles English said on Friday (October 26th) that Republika Srpska (RS) authorities should stop issuing misleading statements about reform measures introduced by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. 
English said these statements contribute to radicalisation and spur nationalism in BiH. 
Any act of leaving the state institutions will be considered an unnecessary provocation, he added.
Reacting to English's statement, RS President Milorad Dodik said he could not accept any violation of the constitution and the Dayton Accords and would not back down from his position.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Friday (January 7th) that the upcoming dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina could be an opportunity for an historic compromise between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians. 
Djelic was speaking in Prizren where he attended the Christmas liturgy. 
He voiced expectations that the dialogue will focus on topics related to peoples' daily life and the status issue. 
Djelic reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence, but also said Belgrade is aware of the need to find a compromise solution for the sake of its EU future.

ATHENS, Greece -- Coastal guards on Tuesday (August 4th) briefly arrested three Turkish journalists who were trying to film Greek troops on a disputed island in the Mediterranean.
The journalists made their way to the island -- called Rho in Greek and Karaada in Turkish -- near the resort town of Kas in Turkey's Antalya province after they heard that Greek soldiers had raised their country's flag there.
Another group of journalists who had headed to the island saw the arrests and notified Turkish coastal guards, who quickly secured the journalists' release.

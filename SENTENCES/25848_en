THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is asking the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution that would recognise the immunity deal he says he struck years ago with former US envoy Richard Holbrooke, media reported on Saturday (October 17th).
In a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, Karadzic noted that the Appeals Chamber at The Hague has refuted his claim of immunity because it did not include "a resolution from the Security Council".
He insists Holbrooke promised him in 1996 that the UN tribunal would leave him alone if he resigned from power.
Holbrooke has repeatedly denied any deal.
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
His trial at The Hague starts on October 26th.

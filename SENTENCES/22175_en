TBILISI, Georgia -- The defence ministry announced on Monday (April 14th) that it will be pulling its 159 troops from Kosovo. 
"The peacekeeping contingent withdrawn will be sent to Afghanistan to join the peacekeeping force there that will take part in the operation within the Dutch and French contingents," ministry spokeswoman Nana Intskirveli said. 
She did not provide the exact date for the redeployment but said participation in NATO activities in Afghanistan would be important to Georgia's bid to join the Alliance.

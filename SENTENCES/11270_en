PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegro's parliament adopted amendments to the Serbian-Montenegro constitutional charter on Thursday (23 June), after three days of debate. 
The changes, agreed on earlier by Montenegrin and Serbian officials, extend the mandates of federal deputies until the next elections. 
According to the amended charter, these are to be held separately in each republic when elections for their respective parliaments are organised.
The changes also addressed Montenegro's potential independence referendum, stipulating that it should be organised in line with international democratic standards and with the EU's co-operation. 
Since the Serbian Parliament has already adopted the amendments, they move next to the federal parliament for approval.

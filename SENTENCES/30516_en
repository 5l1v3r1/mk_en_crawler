BERLIN, Germany -- Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on Thursday (January 13th) criticised Greece's decision to send representation to The Hague-based International Court of Justice in a lawsuit seeking German war reparations. 
The plaintiffs are relatives of those massacred in the Greek village of Distomo during World War II. 
Greece had until Friday to decide whether to join the case, which will decide whether the relatives are entitled to compensation from Germany over the 1944 massacre that left 218 people dead. 
Westerwelle says reparation obligations were established in detail in agreements signed after the war and predicted Germany's immunity under international law will be respected.

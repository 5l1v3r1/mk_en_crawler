SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH confirmed on Monday (September 10th) that 25 defendants facing war crimes charges have begun a co-ordinated hunger strike, for the second time this year. 
They are demanding to be tried under the old Yugoslav law in effect during the 1990s when the maximum prison term for such offenses was 15 years. 
Current Bosnian law provides for sentences of up to 40 years. 
Their first hunger strike effectively blocked all trials at the Sarajevo war crimes chamber in January.

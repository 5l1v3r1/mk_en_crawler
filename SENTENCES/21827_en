BELGRADE, Serbia -- The small opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said on Sunday (November 23rd) it will not support a no-confidence motion filed against Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic's government. 
Observers largely expected the LDP's decision, as it has already allied itself with ruling coalition parties on the Belgrade city council. 
The no-confidence vote will take place on Friday. 
Opposition parties including the Serbian Democratic Party, New Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party accuse the government of negotiating with the EU over the deployment of the EULEX judicial and police mission to Kosovo as a first step towards recognising Kosovo's independence.

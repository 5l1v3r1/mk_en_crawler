ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu urged Syria and Iraq to take concrete steps Thursday (September 17th) to overcome their differences and prevent future terror attacks in the region. 
The statement came after a closed door meeting in Istanbul between Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem and his Iraqi counterpart, Hoshyar Zebari. 
Also on hand was Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa. 
Ties between Syria and Iraq have been strained since Baghdad accused Damascus of a series of terror attacks, including bombings outside ministry buildings that killed 95 people last month. 
Both countries have recalled their ambassadors.
After the meeting Thursday, Davutoglu also said that any purchase of Patriot missiles from the United States would only aim to modernise Turkey's army and would have nothing to do with any particular threat from any neighbour. 
According to Turkish media reports, Ankara ordered 13 Patriot missiles and equipment for a ground-based air defence.

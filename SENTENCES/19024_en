KENNEBUNKPORT, United States -- National Security Adviser Steve Hadley said on Monday (July 2nd) that bilateral talks with Russia on the Kosovo status issue are continuing.
Hadley held a news conference after US President George W. Bush and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin ended their two-day summit in Kennebunkport.
Hadley said the presidents agreed that discussions must continue under the supervision of the two countries' top diplomats, Condoleezza Rice and Sergei Lavrov.
Moscow insists on new negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, disagreeing with former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence, which Washington views as the best solution to the status issue.

ATHENS, Greece -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Saturday (7 August) that it has suspended Ivan Slavkov, the chief of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee, and revoked his credentials for the Summer Games in Athens.
BBC reporters -- posing as businessmen supporting London's bid to host the Olympics -- videotaped Slavkov discussing "favours" that could be used to sway the votes of IOC members.
The BBC broadcast the tape last week.
Slavkov, who is also president of the Bulgarian Football Union, is the son-in-law of the late communist dictator Todor Zhivkov.
In the Bulgarian Parliament, several opposition lawmakers called on Slavkov to resign from both posts.

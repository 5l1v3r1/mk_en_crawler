BUCHAREST, Romania -- Labour unions vowed on Sunday (September 19th) to launch protests Monday, after an apparently unsatisfactory meeting with Prime Minister Emil Boc. 
Union representatives say the government failed to demonstrate responsibility during Saturday's talks, which skirted financial issues. 
Protests are planned in several regions Monday. 
The one in Bucharest begins on Wednesday, outside the government building. 
The unions are demanding an end to government austerity measures, including job cuts, and want the minimum wage boosted.

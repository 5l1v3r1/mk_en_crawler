ATHENS, Greece -- Most of Southeast Europe remains in the grip of a sizzling heat wave, with temperatures soaring into the 40s in many areas.
Three people died and at least 33 were hospitalised with heatstroke in Greece, the Health Ministry said in a statement.
Greece is also facing acute power shortages as people across the country increase their use of fans and air conditioners.
Demand reached 10,372 megawatts on Monday, trouncing the old record of 9,962 megawatts set last August.
On Monday, Greece imported 1,300 megawatts from Bulgaria and Italy, which are also suffering.
Bulgaria reports at least 100 people were hospitalised as a result of the heat.
Heavy trucks have been banned from some highways during daylight hours to prevent damage to melting asphalt.
In Romania, the heat has affected 60% of crops.
Wheat farmers expect the harvest to be 40% smaller than anticipated.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo Albanians reject any solution that would establish a confederation between Kosovo and Serbia, the leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo and member of the Kosovo negotiating team, Hashim Thaci, said on Saturday (September 15th).
He reiterated the prevailing public opinion that independence is the only solution acceptable for Kosovo Albanians.
A recent editorial piece in the Kosovo daily newspaper Koha Ditore cited several Western diplomats who believe that establishing a federation would be acceptable, if suggested by Serbia.

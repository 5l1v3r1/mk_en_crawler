ATHENS, Greece -- The PASOK-led government of Prime Minister George Papandreou on Tuesday (January 18th) refuted an earlier statement suggesting it would seek an extension of the period to repay the country's outstanding debt, beyond its 110 billion-euro EU/IMF bailout loans.
"There is a decision in principle on extension of the repayment of the 110 billion euros, and the government is not discussing anything beyond that," government spokesperson George Petalotis said.
On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Theodore Pangalos told a local TV channel that the "debt repayment extension may refer not only to the 110 billion euros [of emergency EU/IMF funding], but the entire debt." (AP, Reuters - 18/01/11)

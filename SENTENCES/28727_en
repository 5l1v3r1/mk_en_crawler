ANKARA, Turkey -- Four regular and three reserve members of the 11-seat Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) resigned on Monday (October 11th) to protest government efforts to reform the system. 
The move followed citizen approval last month of a series of constitutional amendments proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party. 
Included in the referenda was an overhaul of the HSYK and the Constitutional Court. 
Some analysts say the reforms will strip the judiciary of its role to oversee the executive power. 
"Our opinion on the changes made to the constitution was never even asked," said Kadir Ozbek, HSYK vice chairman, who also resigned. 
He was due to retire in December.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government and the World Bank completed negotiations Friday (16 September) on a new, three-year agreement worth a total of $90m. 
The agreement was sealed in Skopje by Finance Minister Nikola Popovski and World Bank mission chief Bruce Courtney. 
The Bank's board is expected to endorse it in November.

The funds are designated to support the company's restructuring and improve its operations and efficiency.
In other news, the main partners in the ruling coalition For Macedonia Together -- comprised of the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and the Liberal Democratic Party -- have sealed a new co-operation agreement ahead of next year's parliamentary elections.

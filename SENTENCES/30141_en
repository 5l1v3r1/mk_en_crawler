THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serbian Justice Minister Snezana Malovic and President of the International Criminal Court (ICJ) Sang-Hyun Song will sign an agreement Thursday (January 20th) that will allow people convicted by the court to serve their sentence in Serbia. 
The ministry issued a statement noting that Serbia will be the first country from the region to conclude such an accord with the ICJ.

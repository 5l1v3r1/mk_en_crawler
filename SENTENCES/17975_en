SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister designate Nikola Spiric said on Friday (January 19th) that he has submitted the names of all candidates for ministers and deputy ministers to the BiH Central Election Commission (CEC) and the State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA) for verification. 
CEC and SIPA should check the compliance of the nominees with the BiH electoral legislation and their security background, respectively.
Spiric voiced hope that the verification procedure would be completed swiftly and that the new coalition cabinet could be endorsed by the BiH Parliament and assume office in early February. 
He was reluctant to disclose any names until all proceedings are finalised.

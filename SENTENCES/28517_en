ZAGREB, Croatia -- Darinko Kosor, leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), announced on Saturday (November 13th) that his party will run on its own in the parliamentary elections. 
He also ruled out the possibility of any post-election coalition with the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
The HSLS left the ruling coalition in July because it was unhappy with the government's work. 
The next parliamentary elections are about a year away.

STRASBOURG, France -- European Commission Vice President Jacques Barrot, responsible for Justice, Freedom and Security, said in Strasbourg on Thursday (September 17th) that no dialogue at all is taking place on visa liberalisation for Kosovo. 
Since 1999, he said, the population of Kosovo has not been under Serbian government control, and the bloc cannot assume responsibility for the resulting security vacuum.
Neighbouring Macedonia, meanwhile, has met all the conditions for visa-free travel, while Serbia and Montenegro have both made "significant progress", Barrot told the European Parliament.

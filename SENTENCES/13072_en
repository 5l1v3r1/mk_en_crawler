SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) Parliament endorsed the appointments Tuesday (27 September) of two new members of the entity government -- Zahid Crnkic as FBiH Minister for Veterans and Vjekoslav Mandic as Minister of Health.
Their predecessors resigned at the beginning of the month, but the vote on replacements was delayed by problems between FBiH President Niko Lozancic and FBiH Vice President Sahbaz Dzihanovic.
Dzihanovic blocked the procedure, claiming he had not received all the required documents.

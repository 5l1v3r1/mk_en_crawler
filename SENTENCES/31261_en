BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) will hold an anti-government rally on April 16th calling for early elections, SNS Vice President Aleksandar Vucic announced on Tuesday (March 1st).
He blamed the government for the poor economic, political and social situation in the country.
Vucic said that the April 16th rally will attract even more people than the mass demonstration on February 5th, which drew tens of thousands of people.
A recent poll by Factor Plus agency suggests that the SNS has boosted support and is now more popular than the ruling Democratic Party (DS).
The SNS-New Serbia coalition drew the support of 34.4% of potential voters, followed by the DS with 29.1%.

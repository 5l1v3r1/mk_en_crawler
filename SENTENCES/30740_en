NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Two Polish European Parliament (EP) member and two Greek Cypriots were arrested on Saturday (March 12th) for trespassing on a military area in the northern part of the divided island.
The group explained they wanted to visit destroyed Orthodox churches there.
Northern Cypriot authorities said later that the two EP lawmakers have been released.
But Greek Cypriot media said four EP members had been arrested -- Cypriot Eleni Theocharous, Poles Jaroslav Walesa and Artur Zasada, and Bulgarian Maria Nedelcheva.
Media reports suggested the EP members have been released, but that the Greek Cypriots would likely be released on Sunday after paying a fine.

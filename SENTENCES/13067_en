ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The government may ask parliament to approve the issuing of special bonds that comply with Islamic norms during its next session, which begins in October. 
Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan said on Tuesday (27 September) the move is intended to attract investors from the Middle East. 
These bonds would pay them a regular coupon from the cash flow of projects, rather than from interest earned on money -- thus complying with the Islamic ban on usury. 
The government is seeking ways to reconcile the idea with the country's secular constitution.

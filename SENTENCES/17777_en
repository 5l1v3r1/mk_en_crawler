PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament's panel for constitutional issues and legislation called on Tuesday (January 23rd) for the cancellation of an extraordinary session next week that would focus on the 2004 murder of journalist Dusko Jovanovic. 
Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic said he scheduled the session at the request of opposition parties to determine who is responsible for failing to solve the case. 
But the panel for legal issues says such a session would violate the constitution, as it would represent judicial interference. 
Late last month, the Montenegrin High Court acquitted defendant Damir Mandic of the murder, despite significant evidence.

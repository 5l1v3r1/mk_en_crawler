ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Bursa on Monday (3 May) charged nine men with planning to bomb next month's NATO summit in Istanbul. 
Bursa Governor Oguz Kagan Koksal said that the nine suspects belong to the Iraq-based radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam, which is thought to be an ally of al-Qaeda. 
He said the group also planned a strike against a synagogue in Osmangazi and a bank robbery to fund its operations. 
Police monitored the suspects for more than a year and finally arrested 16 individuals. 
Seven of them were later freed.
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans a three-day official visit to Greece this week to discuss bilateral relations, ways to boost co-operation, as well as relevant international issues.

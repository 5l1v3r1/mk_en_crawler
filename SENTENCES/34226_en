ANKARA, Turkey -- Officials reported on Monday (7 July) that the United States military has released 11 Turkish soldiers held since Friday.
The troops spent the night at a guesthouse in Baghdad and were due to be transported to Sulaymaniyah later in the day.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called US Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday to discuss the incident.
Erdogan is planning an official visit to Washington later this month, and Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said the issue of troop arrests would not alter those plans.
He also denied reports that the United States has asked Turkey to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq.

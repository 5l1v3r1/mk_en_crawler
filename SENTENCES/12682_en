SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) party have said they expect incumbent Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg's NMS-II party to reply to an invitation for a coalition cabinet by Wednesday (6 July).
The BSP won the 25 June parliamentary elections but not by a wide enough margin to form a government on its own.
Together, the BSP and MRF jointly control 116 seats in the 240-member parliament, out of 121 needed to have the new cabinet approved.

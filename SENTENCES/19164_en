ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A powerful explosion shook the Zeytinburnu district in Istanbul early Thursday (January 31st) killing at least 17 people and injuring at least 68 others. 
The blast happened in a five-story textile factory which collapsed, trapping several people under the debris. 
Preliminary reports suggested the incident was caused by a natural gas leak. 
Later, however, Istanbul's Governor Muammer Guler blamed an illegal fireworks factory in the building.
In other news, an earthquake measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale rocked Ankara early on Thursday. 
No injuries or damage were reported.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Media giants joined forces Thursday (3 October), asking the UN war crimes tribunal to allow reporters to refuse to testify. 
A group of 34 international media groups, including The Associated Press, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the BBC, signed a statement supporting former Washington Post reporter Jonathan Randal, who is fighting a subpoena. 
They argue that the personal safety of reporters would be compromised and their neutrality questioned if they were to testify against their sources. 
The media group maintains that the tribunal should only question journalists when the information is essential to resolving a case and is impossible to obtain elsewhere. 
Prosecutors argue it would be unfair to grant special privileges to any one group of potential witnesses.

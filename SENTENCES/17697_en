STRASBOURG, France -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis outlined his government's position on several major issues in Southeast Europe (SEE), including Kosovo and the Greek-Macedonian name dispute, during a speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (CoE) on Wednesday (January 24th).
Regarding Kosovo, he said there "still remains a great deal to be achieved" and that the future solution to the Kosovo status problem must be acceptable to both sides.
As for Macedonia, he said resolution of the name dispute is a condition for Greek support of the neighbouring country's EU bid.

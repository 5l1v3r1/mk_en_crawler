BELGRADE, Serbia -- An agreement on police co-operation between EULEX and Serbia should be signed by the end of September, Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic told the Belgrade-based daily Blic on Wednesday (September 9th). 
He added that the document is in the interest of all Kosovo citizens, as it regulates co-operation in fighting all forms of criminal activity, including human trafficking, weapons and drugs smuggling. 
Bogdanovic noted that while Pristina opposes the EULEX agreement with Serbia, it did not object to similar agreements between the EU mission and Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. 
Pristina insists that under the Kosovo Constitution, only the government has the right to conclude such agreements with other countries.

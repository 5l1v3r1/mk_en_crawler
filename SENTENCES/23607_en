TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) is ready to deliver the final results of the June 28th general elections, having reviewed all complaints from political parties through the Election Council, local media reported on Sunday (July 26th). 
But various parties still have another week to file complaints related to the post-election process. 
According to unofficial results, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and its coalition are the winners, leaving the Socialist Party in opposition again. 
The DP formed an alliance with the Socialist Movement for Integration days after the election, securing itself a majority in the 140-seat parliament. 
The Socialists say they will not recognise the election results since the CEC has declined their request for a recount in some regions.

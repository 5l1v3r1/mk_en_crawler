THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's Trial Chamber approved on Friday (July 13th) the provisional release of two former senior Bosnian Serb army officers, Radivoje Miletic and Milan Gvero, allowing them to stay in Serbia until their trial resumes a month from now, following a summer recess for the tribunal.
They are charged with atrocities against Bosniaks in Srebrenica and Zepa in 1995, along with five other former Republika Srpska army officers.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's new Education Minister, Daniel Vulchev, pledged Wednesday (24 August) that the new school year would start on 15 September for all pupils, despite complications caused by flooding.
He told bTV that a total of 331 schools across the country were affected by the floods, but voiced hope that most of the buildings would be rebuilt by mid-September.
In some cases, pupils might be redirected to neighbouring schools.

Four foreign companies have been shortlisted for the sale of public power utility ESM-Distribution, according to the Greek business portal reporter.gr.
The procedure is due to be completed by late March.
Austria's EVN, the Czech firm CEZ, Germany's RWE and Italy's ENEL will compete to purchase a 90 per cent stake in the firm, which has 110m in capital and is considered the most valuable of the Macedonian public enterprises that have been put up for sale.
Three other companies -- the US-based firms AES and Prism Energy, as well as EnBW of Germany -- reportedly picked up the required documentation in December but did not make it through the qualification stage.
The tender was announced on 9 December and published in the Financial Times in London and the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia.
Companies had until 12 December to obtain the tender documentation, for which they had to pay 50,000 euros.
The bidders are to submit their offers by early March.
Under the terms of sale, the purchaser must have assets exceeding 1 billion euros, shareholding capital of more than 500m euros, and more than 150m euros in profits over the past three years.
In addition, it must be experienced in power distribution to more than 700,000 users.
The winning bidder will be required to invest up to 42m euros in the company over the next three years, as well as honour collective agreements.
It will also have to deposit a bank guarantee that the government can withdraw in case the investor does not fulfil its investment commitments.
Immediately before launching the privatisation process, the Macedonian government split ESM into three companies:
ESM-Distribution, the transmission firm ESM MEPSO, and the power producer ESM ELEM.
Austria's Mainel Bank is the main consultant in the privatisation.

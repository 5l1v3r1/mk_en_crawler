ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Thursday (January 18th) rejected a no confidence vote filed against Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul by the opposition centre-right Motherland Party (ANAP). 
Last week, ANAP deputies submitted the motion, accusing Gul of breach of duty and misconduct. 
They say he made too many concessions to the EU, has harmed ties with the United States, failed to pursue farsighted policies on Iraq and Cyprus, and inadequately countered Armenian claims regarding WWI era genocide.

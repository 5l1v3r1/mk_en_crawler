ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The Croatian Parliamentary delegation attending the 48th session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Istanbul objected Saturday (16 November) to two claims about nationalism and discrimination against minorities in Croatia.
The delegation also objected to remarks that described the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia as "nationalistic".
The statements were presented in a declaration by NATO's sub-committee on CEE, NATO enlargement and the Partnership for Peace programme.

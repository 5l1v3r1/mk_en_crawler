SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Experts have discovered the remains of nearly 280 civilians in a mass grave in eastern BiH, in what may be the largest such grave from the four-year war.
In all, it may hold 500 bodies.
Exhumation work began a month ago at the site in Crni Vrh, near the Bosnian border with Serbia, and is expected to continue for at least two more weeks.
In other news, BiH presidency member Sulejman Tihic discussed the country's investment climate and other economic issues Friday (29 August) with British Ambassador Ian Cliff.
They also discussed structural reforms and the international community's role in the process.

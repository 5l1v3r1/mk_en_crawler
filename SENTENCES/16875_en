ANKARA, Turkey -- Labour unions and leftist groups staged demonstrations in Turkey on Monday (4 September) to protest the government's plans to send troops to Lebanon. 
Parliament is expected to vote on the government's motion late Tuesday evening. 
Monday's protests were largely peaceful.
In other news, a small percussion bomb went off in front of the offices of the ruling Justice and Development Party in Izmir. 
No one was injured in the blast. 
As in several other recent bombings, the explosive device was placed in a garbage bin.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, meanwhile, warned Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq about their plans to officially replace the Iraqi national flag with a Kurdish one. 
He urged the Iraqi government to take action to block the move. 
Turkey views it as a step towards the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

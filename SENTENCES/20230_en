ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Thursday (September 13th) that Greek-Turkish relations have improved considerably over the past few years and expressed hope this would continue. 
She stressed that Greece fully supports Turkey's EU integration bid and believes it would boost regional stability and development.
As for Greece's longstanding name dispute with Macedonia, she insisted that Athens cannot and will not rule out exercising any of its rights and options as a member of NATO and the EU. 
She was responding to a comment Wednesday by Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski, who said Skopje will withdraw from talks on the name issue if Greece blocks Macedonia's NATO bid.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The Balkans remain a major transit route for drugs moving from production to consumer countries, despite efforts by local governments to combat trafficking, the US State Department concluded in its annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report published on Monday (March 1st).
According to the document, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey are major transit countries for narcotics smuggling.
To a lesser extent, the report said, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo and Montenegro are also smuggling routes.
Albania is seen as a cannabis supplier, while Bulgaria produces amphetamine-type stimulants.
The report warns of a surge in drug use in Croatia, Cyprus and Kosovo.
Macedonia is singled out as neither a big producer nor a major regional transit point for illegal drug trafficking.

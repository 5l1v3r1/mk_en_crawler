SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Relations in the ruling coalitions in both the Federation of BiH (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS) grew more strained at the weekend, newspapers reported on Saturday (January 19th). 
The two main Bosniak parties -- the Party of Democratic Action and Party for BiH -- clashed last week over the FBiH government's decision to appoint a new board of directors in the state's largest company, the power utility, Elektroprivreda BiH.
In RS, the minor ruling coalition ally, the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP), seeks new talks with the Union of Independent Social Democrats about implementation of the coalition agreement. 
PDP General Secretary Gavrilo Antonic acknowledged that relations between the two parties have deteriorated and demanded that urgent talks be held.

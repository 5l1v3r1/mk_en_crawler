SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Lawmakers approved on Saturday (July 26th) the new government led by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who promised to speed up reforms that would help the country join the EU.
Gruevski's party, the VMRO-DPMNE, won a convincing victory in the June 1st snap elections, gaining a majority in the 120-seat parliament.
It then formed a coalition with the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration.
Members of the other main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), as well as the opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), were not present at Saturday's session, as they are boycotting parliament.
The SDSM walked out about ten days ago after the arrest of one of its leaders, Zoran Zaev, for alleged links to organised crime.
The DPA has also refused to take part, citing concerns over the legitimacy of election results in areas populated primarily by Albanians.
In other news, European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso sent a letter to Gruevski on Friday, saying the EC is unable to intervene in issues related to what Skopje describes as a Macedonian minority in Greece.
Gruevski had asked the EC to help Skopje in its efforts to make Greece recognise the minority, which Athens says does not exist.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro stands at a very important crossroads, Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Terry Davis said on Thursday (6 April) in a speech to members of the federal parliament. 
Regardless of the outcome of Kosovo status negotiations and the Montenegrin independence referendum, "Albanians, Montenegrins, Serbs and other nations in the region would still have to live next to each other, to live together," Davis said.
Also Thursday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Bucharest. 
Rehn told reporters that he encouraged Kostunica to face the numerous challenges confronting Serbia, including co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
Kostunica described the talks with Rehn as friendly and constructive.

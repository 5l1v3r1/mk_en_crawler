PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A fraction of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) called the Ibrahim Rugova List reached a pre-election coalition agreement with former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj's opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) on Wednesday (November 10th).
The List, led by the son of former president and political icon Rugova, considered previous agreements between the parties before reaching the agreement.
"Unfortunately, all doors for our inclusion to the LDK were closed," Uke Rugova said after newly elected LDK Chairman Isa Mustafa failed to include the group in their structures.
The List issued a press release saying the LDK has nothing in common with Rugova's vision.
The response from the LDK was fast, confirming the readiness of the party to bring Rugova back to the structures of the party.

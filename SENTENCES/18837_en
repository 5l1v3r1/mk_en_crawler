KRUSEVAC, Serbia -- The Serbian police detained 27 persons on Saturday (May 5th) after a gathering of nationalists in Krusevac.
Participants were allegedly seeking to form a volunteer fighting group in Kosovo, to be known as "Guard of Prince Lazar".
According to the interior ministry, the detainees were dressed in black uniforms with the insignia of its former Unit for Special Operations (JSO), which was dissolved after the 1990s conflict.
A check established that none of the detainees had ever been a JSO member or a ministry employee.

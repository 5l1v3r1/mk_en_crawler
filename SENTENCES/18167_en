BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Christian Schwarz-Schilling and EU security chief Javier Solana condemned on Wednesday (January 17th) any attempt to link the future of BiH's Republika Srpska (RS) with the Kosovo status issue. 
Following talks with Solana, as well as with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Brussels, Schwarz-Schilling said the EU was unhappy with comments from Belgrade suggesting the outcome of the Kosovo status issue would impact RS. 
He reiterated that BiH is a sovereign state, whose territorial integrity is guaranteed by the Dayton Peace Accord and said that Serbia, as a signatory to Dayton, must respect its international commitments.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's tiny Assyrian population was allowed to officially celebrate its New Year for the first time, The New York Times reported Saturday (9 April).
A crowd of 6,000 people converged on a hill in Anatolia to mark the holiday on 1 April.
Organisers received permission from the government to stage the event, in light of democratic reforms adopted in support of Turkey's EU membership bid.

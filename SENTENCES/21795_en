TIRANA, Albania -- The Human Rights Union Party (HURP), a ruling coalition ally, has asked the government to replace its current party representative, Minister of Work, Social Welfare and Equal Rights, Kosta Barka. 
During a meeting with Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Monday (September 22nd), HURP leader Vangjel Dule called for Barka, whom the party says no longer serves its interests, to be replaced by Andrea Marto. 
Barka says he only learned of his proposed replacement from media reports.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Senior EU representatives met with an Albanian government delegation headed by Foreign Minister Kastriot Islami on Tuesday (1 February). 
The EU officials stressed the importance of conducting fair and transparent elections, as well as implementing enhanced measures against corruption. 
They described these as the two major conditions the country must meet before the enforcement of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
In Tirana, meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Sali Berisha, called on the United States to deploy monitors to oversee voting later this year.

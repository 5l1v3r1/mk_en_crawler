ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) demanded the dismissal Friday (May 25th) of Interior Minister Ivica Kirin, accusing him of making unacceptable statements and misappropriating his authority. 
The party's call followed the posting of video on YouTube that seemed to suggest Kirin has property -- such as expensive watches or houses -- that far exceed his official income, leading to allegations of corruption. 
Kirin pushed back however, saying it appears SDP was responsible for the video. 
When other senior officials at the Interior Ministry said no formal investigation had been launched into the source of the video, SDP suggested its computers might have been tapped. 
The party demanded that Kirin either show a court order authorising surveillance of its offices, or resign immediately.

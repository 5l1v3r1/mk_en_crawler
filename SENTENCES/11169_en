ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has suggested holding new trilateral talks on regional security with Bulgaria and Romania.
Meeting with Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu in Ankara on Friday (25 March), Sezer reportedly proposed that a trilateral summit be held this year to focus on Black Sea security issues, in order to identify security risks and possible solutions.
Also Friday, Turkey's top human rights adviser Yavuz Onen resigned from his post, citing what he described as the government's insincerity on the subject.
Five other members of the board have left their jobs, embarrassing the government as it works to convince the EU that human rights are being better protected.
In other news, five members of the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) resigned from the party on Monday.
They were protesting an effort by the CHP Discipline Board to expel Mustafa Sarigul, mayor of the wealthiest district of Istanbul, Sisli.
Sarigul ran against CHP leader Deniz Baykal for the party presidency in late January.

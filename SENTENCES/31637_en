BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Pierre-Richard Prosper told Yugoslavia's <I>Vecernje Novosti</I> newspaper on Wednesday (15 January) that the Bush administration was contemplating the suspension of financial assistance to Belgrade. 
He explained that the State Department insists on the arrest of Ratko Mladic and two other suspects believed to be hiding in Yugoslavia. 
In March, Secretary of State Colin Powell must certify before Congress that Belgrade is co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The absence of certification would result in the suspension of assistance. 
Prosper explained that the arrest of the three fugitives could be vital to the release of funds.

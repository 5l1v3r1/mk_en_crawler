SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The next director of the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) must be of the highest calibre and integrity, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Monday (September 17th). 
He dubbed recent statements by officials implying otherwise as "wholly inappropriate". 
The agency is responsible for fighting organised crime, war crimes, terrorism, serious financial crime and human trafficking. 
Success in any of these areas would be a step forward in BiH's EU integration process, the envoy said.
Lajcak's comments came in response to a growing debate over whether the SIPA head should be a Serb or a Bosniak. 
The previous director was from the Federation of BiH, so Serbs insist it is their turn to elect an agency chief. 
But Bosniaks say the agency would not prosecute war crimes if a Serb takes over.

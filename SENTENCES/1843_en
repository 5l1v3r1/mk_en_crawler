On 5 September, an unprecedented event took place in Romanian politics. 
For the first time, a political party -- the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) -- held a primary to select its candidates for the 28 November parliamentary elections.
The primary was intended to reinvigorate the party and to provide a new and more democratic way of nominating candidates. 
However, it also appears to have stirred up the tensions that surfaced after the PSD's poor showing in local elections last June.
In general, key party figures at the national and local level received the lion's share of the votes. 
As a result, they will be placed at the top of the candidates' lists and can be relatively sure of being elected senators or deputies.
But some politicians were not so lucky. 
Culture Minister Razvan Theodorescu and Education Minister Alexandru Athanasiu got fewer votes than expected. 
In all, about half of the PSD senators and deputies were disappointed by the results.
Prime Minister and PSD leader Adrian Nastase, who won first place on the list for the Chamber of Deputies in Bucharest, said he was surprised that "some people, who I thought would have the support of their organisations, weren't too successful."
"For a politician like Athanasiu, who was a valuable deputy, [we] will find a solution to keep him in parliament," Nastase added. 
"I'm sure the results will create nervousness. 
But I believe all dissatisfactions will be overcome."
Such assertions have led some to question the real significance of these elections. 
An agreement signed between the PSD and the Romanian Humanistic Party (PUR) on the day of the primaries further decreases the opportunities for those who didn't do well in the vote.
Under the deal, PSD and PUR will run a joint campaign for the parliamentary elections. 
PUR will get 22 eligible places on the lists for the chamber of deputies, and 10 for the Senate race.

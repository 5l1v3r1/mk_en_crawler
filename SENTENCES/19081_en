ANKARA, Turkey -- The row between the cabinet and the military deepened on Thursday (March 1st), amid comments confirming serious differences over Turkey's policy towards Iraq.
In an interview with CNN Turk, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced recent remarks by General Staff Chief General Yasar Buyukanit, in which he accused Iraqi Kurdish leaders of helping Turkish Kurdish militants hide in northern Iraq.
Buyukanit ruled out any contact with them.
Erdogan stressed that while that might be Buyukanit's personal opinion, such foreign policy issues are the responsibility of the cabinet.
Shortly after Erdogan's interview, however, the general staff issued a press release backing Buyukanit's position.
In other news Thursday, the foreign ministry issued a statement protesting a military co-operation accord France and Cyprus signed earlier this week.
Ankara says it would only harm efforts to reunify Cyprus.

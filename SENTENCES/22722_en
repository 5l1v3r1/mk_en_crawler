PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition parties on Sunday (September 7th) demanded Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni's resignation, in part for failing to lobby successfully for Kosovo's international recognition.
The opposition insisted Hyseni report to parliament on his policy failures, likely the first issue lawmakers will discuss during parliament's autumn session.
In other news, the OSCE's latest report on human rights, ethnic relations and democracy --between August 2007 and July 2008 -- criticises Kosovo authorities for attempts to influence institutions such as the police, judiciary and the media.
The report, however, does not address the violence in northern Kosovo which followed Pristina's unilaterally declared independence in February, local media said.

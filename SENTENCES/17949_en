TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj on Saturday (December 16th) urged Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority to preserve the province's multiethnic character.
The Albanian government, he added, opposes any action that would exclude Kosovo's minorities.
He wrapped up a two-day visit to Pristina on Sunday, reiterating his government's stance that Kosovo's independence could lead to stability and peace in the Balkans.
Invited by UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker, Mustafaj met with international representatives, Kosovo interim government officials and members of various political parties.
In other news, Kosovo police announced at the weekend that a 27-year old woman had been detained for the burning of Serbs' property during the 2004 ethnic riots.
She was arrested on the Pristina-Kosovo Polje road and transferred to custody in Pristina.

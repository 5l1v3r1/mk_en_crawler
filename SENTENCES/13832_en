THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's trial chamber on Friday (19 August) rejected former Republika Srpska (RS) Parliamentary Chairman Momcilo Krajisnik's motion for acquittal. 
His lawyers had argued there was insufficient evidence to charge the former Bosnian Serb leader with genocide. 
The Chamber noted point by point the soundness of each of the eight counts in the indictment. 
It also stressed that as one of the key political figures in the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) leadership, Krajisnik played a central role in formulating the SDS policy for persecution of non-Serbs in Serb-controlled municipalities. 
Krajisnik has been in custody since April 2000.
In other news, UN tribunal prosecutors reportedly have objected to a recent request from lawyers representing former Bosnian Croat officer Ivica Rajic to transfer the case to Croatian instead of BiH authorities. 
Rajic, who commanded a unit of the Croatian Defence Council during the war, is charged with October 1993 crimes against Bosniaks, including murder, inhuman treatment, unlawful confinement of civilians and sexual assault.

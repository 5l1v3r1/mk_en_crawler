BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Momcilo Perisic, the former Yugoslav Army chief-of-staff, said he will surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (7 March), local news sources reported Thursday.
He said this is the only way to "defend his honour".
The cabinet praised his decision and said the government would provide him with financial support.
Perisic's was one of six indictments issued by the tribunal last year.

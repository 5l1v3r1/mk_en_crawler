TIRANA, Albania -- Police arrested three Afghan citizens Wednesday (June 18th) at the Kapshtica border checkpoint after they attempted to illegally enter Albania from Greece. 
The three were hiding in the trunk of a truck driven by an Iranian citizen, whom police also arrested. 
Police are investigating the matter as evidence of a possible human trafficking ring since this was the second such case of the month. 
Recently, they caught another two illegal Afghan immigrants at the same checkpoint attempting to reach Italy and the EU via Albania.

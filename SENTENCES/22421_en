SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski sent a letter to his Greek counterpart Costas Karamanlis on Monday (July 14th), asking him to recognise the Macedonian minority in Greece. 
Gruevski urged Karamanlis to permanently resolve the "historical mistakes of the past", which, according to him, would improve ties between the two countries. 
He wants the Macedonian minority to receive education in its mother tongue, be allowed to preserve its culture and traditions and be allowed to use its own language in local government institutions in areas heavily populated by Macedonians.
On Tuesday, Karamanlis responded by saying that Athens has no intention of discussing such issues, which he says fall outside the scope of ongoing efforts to resolve the long-standing name dispute between the two countries.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US soldiers under KFOR are replacing a Turkish military unit in northern Kosovo on Tuesday (January 5th).
The US army unit will be deployed in a KFOR camp near Leposavic, the NATO-led force said in a statement, describing it as a regular and planned rotation of international military forces.
Meanwhile, Slovakia says it is planning to withdraw 139 of its soldiers in KFOR and leave 20 soldiers to work in the intelligence services.
"By the end of 2010, the motorised unit which is serving in Kosovo under the NATO flag, could return home.
There is no longer a need for the multi-national group centre in which our soldiers are serving," Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Baska said.
The Slovak soldiers have been in Kosovo for 11 years.
NATO plans to reduce the number of KFOR soldiers from 15,000 to 10,000 by the end of January.

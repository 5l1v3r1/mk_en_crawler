ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said Monday (3 February) Turkey would ask parliamentary approval for the deployment of US troops on Turkish territory by the end of the week. 
Gul remained vague on what extension of the authority of his government he would require and whether Turkish armed forces would be allowed involvement in actual combat. 
Gul met key opposition leader Deniz Baykal Monday to brief him on the latest developments. 
Local media, meanwhile, are producing mixed messages concerning the support that Turkey would provide, the number of troops involved and the permissions they will have.

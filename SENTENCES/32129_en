PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Miodrag Vukovic, a co-chairman of the committee drafting the constitutional charter of the future state of Serbia and Montenegro, said Thursday (14 November) that only with EU mediation would the two sides resolve their deepening differences.
He urged the Union to make clear that it is dissatisfied with the way in which certain members of the Constitutional Commission have approached the problem.
Talks ended in another deadlock earlier this week.
In other news Thursday, the Yugoslav parliament adopted a declaration on the protection of Yugoslavia's interests in the process of defining the border with Croatia in the Boka Kotorska region, asking the UN to extend the mandate of its peacekeepers on Prevlaka by another six months.
Only a day before, Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic insisted that Montenegro and Croatia negotiate the issue without Belgrade's mediation.

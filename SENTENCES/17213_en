BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, says the EU has unofficially set three conditions for resuming Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Serbia. 
The talks were frozen in May over Serbia's failure to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
In comments published in Thursday's (December 28th) Vecernje novosti, Ljajic said the conditions are the formation of a democratic government after the January 21st parliamentary elections, a firm statement by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that fugitive Ratko Mladic would be detained, and the provision of convincing evidence that Belgrade's action plan to arrest Mladic is advancing.
In other news, prosecutors announced on Wednesday plans to investigate five more people suspected of helping Mladic evade capture. 
A separate trial already is under way in Belgrade against 11 alleged Mladic aides.

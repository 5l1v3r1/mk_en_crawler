SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Tuesday (July 15th) that RS stopped the handover of authority to state-level institutions some time ago and may revisit some of those efforts.
Dodik explained that RS has transferred about 50 duties to state-level institutions but only under pressure from the international community.
Right now, BiH is far from consensus on constitutional changes, he said, adding that he doubts talks on the issue will succeed.
They are due to begin after the October 5th local elections.
The EU and the international community have repeatedly called for amendments to the current constitutional framework, saying it complicates the decision-making process and could hamper EU-related reforms, thus slowing BiH's integration process.

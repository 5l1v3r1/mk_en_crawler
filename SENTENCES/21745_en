BUCHAREST, Romania --Vandals tore through Bucharest's Jewish Cemetery early Thursday (October 23rd), damaging hundreds of graves and monuments in what some say was an organised attack. 
According to representatives of Romania's Jewish community, the incident was the worst of its kind in recent times. 
Later Thursday, the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania filed an official complaint with the justice ministry over the desecration of graves. 
The ministry has promised a full investigation. 
The government "firmly condemns all kinds of manifestations of this kind, as well as other anti-Semitic, xenophobic and racist acts", according to a statement Friday.

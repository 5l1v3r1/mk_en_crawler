BUCHAREST, Romania -- The prince of Hohenzollern-Veringen, Radu Duda, son-in-law of former King Mihai I of Romania, announced his candidacy for president on Thursday (April 9th).
The election will be held in November.
He explained he will run as an independent, which he says will guarantee his impartiality as president.
He also stressed he has no plans to re-establish the monarchy.
A former actor, Prince Radu Duda started his political career in 2002, when he was appointed the special representative of Romania's government, a post he retained until last year.
He married Princess Margareta, King Mihai's daughter, in 1996.

Other likely candidates are ruling Social Democratic Party leader Mircea Geoana and the National Liberal Party's new leader, Crin Antonescu.

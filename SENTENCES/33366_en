ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish Central Bank cut interest rates by three points to 41 per cent on Wednesday (4 June), following strong criticism from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Turkey's leader blasted the bank for not intervening to stop the appreciation of the lira against the US dollar, which is hurting exports. 
The bank said it decided to cut the interest rate because of the fall in inflation, rather than to reflect developments in the foreign exchange market. 
According to official figures, consumer prices rose by 1.6 per cent in May, bringing inflation in the past 12 months to 30.7 per cent.
Also Wednesday, Turkey and the World Bank reached an agreement on the draft of the Public Procurement Law. 
The law will be submitted to parliament by next week. 
The draft law provides for public institutions operating in the energy, water, transportation and telecommunications sectors to be excluded from its provisions.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Friday (March 14th) there is neither room nor time for remarks that question the existence of BiH and its entities.
"There is no question that under Dayton Republika Srpska (RS) is a constitutionally recognised category.
The territorial integrity and sovereignty of BiH must be respected by all, including the RS," Lajcak said in a video statement published on the www.reci.ba website.
Also on Friday, Lajcak praised RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik for his contribution to the preservation of peace and stability in BiH after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia.
Speaking at a news conference in Sarajevo, Lajcak said Dodik was right to request that other partners in the state-level ruling coalition acknowledge and guarantee the existence of RS, since this would put an end to any secession and referendum speculations.

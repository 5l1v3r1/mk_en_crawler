CHISINAU, Moldova -- Prime Minister Vasile Tarlev voiced support Thursday (16 February) for Croatia's initiative to expand the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
After meeting with visiting Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader, Tarlev said Moldova wants to become a CEFTA member and considers co-operation within that framework important for the common European future.
Sanader said he has agreed with leaders of the other two CEFTA members -- Romania and Bulgaria -- that the enlargement should occur during the first half of this year.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The country faces a series of technical requirements before the process of lifting its visa regime with EU countries begins, reforms that include "reintegration and repatriation", Khaldoun Sinno, chief of the Political, Economic and European Integration Section at the European Commission (EC) Liaison Office in Pristina said on Monday (April 19th).
The EC office said that the negotiation process will focus on improving border management, immigration management, fighting organised crime, terrorism and corruption, human and minority rights, free movement and issuing of personal documents.
Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi predicted on Sunday that Kosovo will see the visa regime lifted by 2011, or 2012 at the latest.

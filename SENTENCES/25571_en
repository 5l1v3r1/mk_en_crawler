BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu issued a statement Thursday (September 24th) calling for a referendum aimed at reforming parliament by turning it from two chambers into a unicameral structure. 
This would reduce the number of lawmakers from 471 to 300. 
Basescu stressed the change would be essential to ongoing efforts to slash spending. 
He wants the referendum to take place on the same day as the presidential elections, November 22nd, again to lower costs.
In the same statement, Basescu called for broader constitutional reforms, describing the introduction of a unicameral parliament as the first step. 
His call, two months before the election, was criticised by most political parties.

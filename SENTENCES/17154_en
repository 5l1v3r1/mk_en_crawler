THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Macedonia sealed a readmission agreement Tuesday (30 May) with the Benelux countries -- Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 
Under the deal, signed during a working visit to The Hague by Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva, the signatories agreed to readmit expelled nationals, including suspected criminals or illegal migrants. 
Signing readmission agreements with EU member states is seen as key to the liberalisation of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens, Mitreva noted.

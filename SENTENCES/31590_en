WASHINGTON, United States -- Both the United States and the EU oppose starting talks on Kosovo's status, an idea suggested by Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic late last week. 
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters Friday (17 January) that Kosovo would need to make more progress in meeting the UN benchmarks before any negotiations could start. 
Both the EU and the US reiterated their position that UNMIK must first finish its job of rebuilding institutions, ensuring refugee returns and improving security in the province before the status issue is raised.

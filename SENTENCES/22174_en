SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Unless the country improves its image during the ongoing campaign and on election day, Macedonia can expect a negative assessment and no date to launch its EU accession negotiations this year, EU Ambassador to Skopje Erwan Fouere told the Alsat-M television channel Thursday (May 15th). 
"There will probably be a negative influence without a doubt. 
This is a tragedy, considering that two months ago, the EU commissioner [for Enlargement Olli Rehn] came here and said this year may be historic for Macedonia and its citizens regarding their EU aspirations," Fouere said. 
He urged authorities, particularly in the interior ministry, to find those responsible for incidents that marred the official launch of campaigning last weekend, including an assassination attempt.

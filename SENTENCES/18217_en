SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leading officials from the main four parties -- the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the Democratic Party of Albanians, and the opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and Democratic Union for Integration -- met on Wednesday (December 13th) to discuss key issues in the country's reform agenda. 
EU envoy in Skopje Erwan Fouere and US Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic also attended. 
The talks focused primarily on VMRO-DPMNE's proposal for constitutional changes aimed at restructuring the education sector, as well as amendments to parliament's regulations, which the parties agreed must result from political consensus.

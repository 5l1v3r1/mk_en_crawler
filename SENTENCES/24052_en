LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Borut Pahor announced on Wednesday (December 17th) that Slovenia will use its right of a veto to block Croatia's further EU accession talks in light of the long-standing dispute between Ljubljana and Zagreb over the maritime border in Piran Bay. 
On Friday, Croatia and the EU are expected to announce that five of the country's pre-accession negotiations chapters are closed and ten new ones will open, if all members agree.
At a news conference Wednesday, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said that blocking ten negotiation chapters is an unprecedented move. 
"I am not a big optimist, but I expect Slovenia to reconsider its decision," Sanader said.

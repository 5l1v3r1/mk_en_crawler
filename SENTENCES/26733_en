PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A new survey finds that 28% of Kosovo Serbs will participate in the November 15th local elections, compared to 32% who won't and 40% who say they are undecided.
The survey was conducted in Gracanica, a Serb-dominated town in the outskirts of Pristina, and was released on Sunday (November 8th).
Belgrade is urging Kosovo Serbs to boycott the vote and support the parallel structures financed by Serbia instead.
But Momcilo Trajkovic, the Serb candidate for mayor of Gracanica, has said the most important reason for participating is local self-administration, to better influence everyday life.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Three former generals investigated for their alleged involvement in the bloody "Miners' Crusade" of June 1990 will be brought to trial, local media reported on Thursday (August 9th). 
Military prosecutors say former President Ion Iliescu personally issued orders to disperse a crowd that had gathered for a peaceful anticommunist demonstration in Bucharest. 
NGOs say more than 100 people were killed during three days of violence. 
Over 1,000 were wounded.
Retired generals Mihai Chitac, Gheorghe Andrita and Dimitru Costea, charged with homicide and participation in the manslaughter 17 years ago, said they were only obeying Iliescu's orders. 
They held senior posts in the defence and interior ministries, and claim Iliescu ordered them to use war ammunition and tanks to handle the crowd. 
There were about 260 arrests, most of them passersby and students taking exams in the university building. 
Iliescu denied the allegations Thursday, calling them "absurd".

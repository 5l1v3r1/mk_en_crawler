BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic said Wednesday (19 January) that he expects a political agreement by the weekend on forming a new cabinet. 
Bukejlovic is holding talks with the parties in parliament and has already received backing from the Serb Democratic Party. 
The RS government resigned last month, following sanctions by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
In other news Wednesday, a US judge ruled that former Bosnian Ambassador to the UN Mohamed Sacirbey should be extradited to his home country to stand trial for financial misconduct. 
Sacirbey, 48, who holds dual Bosnian and US citizenship, is charged with stealing $600,000 from the accounts of the Bosnian mission in New York as well as $1.8m from a Bosnian investment firm.

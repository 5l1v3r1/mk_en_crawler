SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia will not pull its troops from Iraq despite the reported deaths of two of its nationals employed as construction workers there, Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva told reporters Wednesday (20 October).
"The latest tragic event â€¦ does not put in question the continued presence of our soldiers in Iraq, nor our participation in the international allied coalition," she said.
Macedonia has 32 soldiers and a number of civilians in Iraq.
Meanwhile, the head of the Bulgarian Army's general staff, General Nikola Kolev, visited Skopje on Wednesday and reaffirmed his country's support for Macedonia's NATO accession bid.
The visit was also aimed at bolstering bilateral co-operation in the defence sector.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb Court on Friday (21 July) rejected a demand by prosecutors to place former Croatian Democratic Union leader Branimir Glavas, currently under investigation for war crimes, in custody. 
The prosecutors placed the request the previous day, citing Glavas's public revelation of witness testimony. 
In rejecting the demand, investigative judge Zdenko Posavec said the parties in the case have now signed statements, committing not to disclose any details from the court proceedings to the public. 
The prosecution said it would appeal.

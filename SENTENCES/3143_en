Every city has its unique attractions: cuisine, picturesque sights, galleries and museums -- and in Belgrade's case, a high-tech public parking system.
Desperate Serbwife lauds the city's innovative approach, which relies on text messaging instead of old-fashioned metres.
"When you park your car downtown, you pay for your parking by texting your license plate number to the parking officials and pay via your cell phone bill at the end of the month. 
You can buy one hour at a time and it's enforced by a metre maid coming along with a handheld computer and typing in your license number -- if your number is not entered, you get a ticket. 
If it is, then the metre maid just moves along.
"Why can't they come up with such a cool system in the United States? 
This is just so simple and better than having to pay a machine or a metre because you can pay the bill each hour from your phone sitting at your desk," she adds.
Bg anon at Belgrade Blog posts excerpts from a Blic article on what tourists find most attractive about the Serbian capital. 
Everyone loves Kalemegdan Park, it finds, but otherwise visitors from different parts of Europe have distinct preferences. 
While the English like Belgrade's riverboats and nightlife, the French prefer its architecture and museums, while the Germans appreciate both. 
The Italians, meanwhile, are interested in Serbian fashion and the women who wear it.
"In my opinion, there is never enough study done on the habits of tourists. 
Serbia will of course never be able to live from tourism in the way that our neighbours Croatia and Montenegro do, but the tourism industry is a crucial part of Serbia's future," writes Bg anon.
Elsewhere in the blogosphere:
Dictionary of the Serbian Mess posts the Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian versions of a Wikipedia entry -- all three of which look uncannily alike. 
"I wrote in my CV that I speak fluently five languages," jokes one commenter. 
"Three of them were Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian. 
I'm hoping to get another one in there soon, Montenegrian, or whatever the spelling will be."
Future of Kosovo is a multicontributor blog that aims to promote multiethnic co-existence and provide a "means of information for the life of Kosovar Albanians and Kosovar Serbs".
One contributor, WARchild, maintains his own blog at Free Kosova, with recent entries about plans for a highway linking Kosovo to the Albanian port of Durres, an EU package of incentives meant to convince Serbia to accept "limited sovereignty" for the province, and the possible repercussions of the status issue on Serbian politics.
And that's all for this week.

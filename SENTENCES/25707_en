SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko warned on Tuesday (September 22nd) that the political situation in BiH has worsened over the past few months and most reforms have stalled. 
Addressing the EU's Political and Security Committee in Brussels, he noted that the lack of dialogue and rising tensions among local political leaders have affected the work of political institutions, especially those at the state-level. 
Inzko said that since June, BiH authorities have made no substantial progress in meeting the five objectives and two conditions required before his Office of the High Representative is turned into the Office of the EU's Special Representative.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said he sees the future BiH as a federal, asymmetric state and does not believe the Bosniak parties' proposal for division of the country into several multiethnic regions would provide a viable constitutional model.
During a meeting Thursday (August 30th) with Cardinal Vinko Puljic, head of the Croat Catholic community in BiH, Dodik said he thinks Croats should have their own territorial entity in BiH and indicated RS would support them if they demand a third federal unit. 
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak has urged Dodik to refrain from such comments.

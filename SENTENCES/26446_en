BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government rejected on Tuesday (August 11th) media reports that suspected terrorists held at the US detention camp of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba could serve their sentences on Serbian territory. 
Government spokesperson Milivoje Mihajlovic says no minister in the cabinet has considered this scenario. 
Belgrade-based daily Danas reported on Tuesday that former Guantanamo detainees could be transferred to the Zabela prison in Pozarevac, a suggestion purportedly relayed by the US Embassy in Belgrade.

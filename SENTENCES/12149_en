ZAGREB, Croatia -- To fully implement the action plan to arrest fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has banned all those involved in the operation from taking summer leave. 
Government spokesperson Ratko Macek told the Vjesnik newspaper Monday (11 July) that an alert has been raised for all security agencies and that Sanader will not allow the summer recess to delay measures aimed at apprehending the retired general. 
The start of Croatia's EU talks has been delayed because of failure to resolve the Gotovina issue.

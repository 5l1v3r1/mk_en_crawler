ZAGAREB, Croatia -- Croatia has entered a new stage in ties with the EU and the time for real reforms has come, according to a top European Commission official.
Fabrizio Barbaso, head of the European Commission Directorate-General for Enlargement, met in Zagreb on Friday (11 November) with Croatian Foreign Affairs and European Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic to discuss the EU's latest progress report.
While reforms so far have been voluntary, Barbaso said, they will now be obligatory and take place according to a timetable.
The accession process might be painful, but will ultimately have a very positive impact on the country, he added.
In other news, the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) held a two-day party meeting on Friday and Saturday.
Addressing the event, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader expressed satisfaction with the results achieved during two years in power.
He rejected the possibility of early elections, saying neither the HDZ nor the opposition Social Democrats are ready for them.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- President Ibrahim Rugova on Thursday (2 December) formally nominated Ramush Haradinaj for the post of prime minister of Kosovo.
The nomination was the result of an agreement between Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo and Haradinaj's smaller Alliance for the Future of Kosovo.
Under the deal, the president would serve one more term, while Haradinaj would get the prime minister's post.
Haradinaj, a former KLA commander who has been questioned by the UN war crimes tribunal, said Thursday that as prime minister he would focus on meeting the democracy standards that the international community has set for Kosovo.

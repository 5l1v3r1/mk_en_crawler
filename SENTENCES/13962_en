ANKARA, Turkey -- Three people died and 11 were injured in clashes between a group of protestors and police in the southeast town of Yuksekova, in the Hakkyari province, according to local media reports Tuesday (15 November). 
Fighting erupted after the demonstrators -- who gathered to protest in front of the pro-Kurdish Democratic People's Party headquarters in the town -- started throwing stones at police and set up street barricades. 
Last week, two people died and more than ten were injured in a bombing in the neighbouring town of Semdinli.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- After nine years of existence, the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) ceased operation on Monday (January 19th) to make room for the Kosovo Security Forces (KSF), which become operational Tuesday. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu described the last day as both emotional and historic in terms of Kosovo's progress and development.
In other news Monday, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said in Brussels that he is ready to consider abolishing the military safety zone around Kosovo. 
Belgrade first suggested removing the safety zone late last year. 
NATO established it in the wake of the its 1999 air strikes on Serbia.
Meanwhile, the second largest opposition party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Dardania (LDD), has joined the other opposition party, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, in rejecting Sejdiu's decision to hold general elections in 2011. 
Sejdiu's office announced last week that general elections should occur after the mandate of the current parliament expires, in 2011. 
LDD leader Nexhat Daci rejected that as totalitarian.

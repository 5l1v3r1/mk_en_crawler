TIRANA, Albania -- Dutch Ambassador to Tirana Henk Van Del Dool urged political leaders Sunday (September 26th) not to block Albania's European agenda. 
The longstanding conflict between the government and the opposition is disappointing and should be resolved as soon as possible, he said. 
"This is not a situation that helps Albania's European perspective or the [May 2011] local elections," he added. 
The opposition Socialist Party (SP) continues to insist on a thorough investigation into the June 2009 general elections, arguing the vote was marred by serious violations. 
The SP has warned that it will stage new anti-government protests in October.

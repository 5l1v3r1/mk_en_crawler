ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament is facing a busy week loaded with important debate, local media reported Monday (12 July).
Legislation intended to further pave the way to meeting EU standards is expected to be the main focus.
Among the reforms sought by the Union is the removal of all references to capital punishment from regulatory and legal documents.
Another important item on the agenda is the action to be taken against former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, former State Minister Gunes Taner and former Energy Ministers Cumhur Ersumer and Zeki Cakan.
Parliament's justice committee has recommended that all four be brought before the Supreme Court on charges of corruption.

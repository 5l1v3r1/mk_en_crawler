ANKARA, Turkey -- The military prosecutor's office has launched an investigation of several army officers over forming an illegal organisation, the daily Aksham reported on Friday (July 18th). 
The case may be connected to a probe of the shadowy secularist group Ergenekon, which allegedly was plotting a coup against the pro-Islamic government. 
According to the news report, in 2005 the National Intelligence Agency investigated more than 20 air force officers who were allegedly conspiring to form an illegal organisation. 
The Turkish General Staff described the story as "an attempt of some circles to portray the military as an enemy of the state".

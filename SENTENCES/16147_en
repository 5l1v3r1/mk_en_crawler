BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new survey finds that most members of the public oppose keeping former agents of the Communist-era security services Securitate in senior state positions.
According to the results of a poll by the INSOMAR agency, 83 per cent of respondents said that a politician found to have collaborated with Securitate must leave his or her current post.
The other 17 per cent said they were undecided.
The findings coincide with efforts by the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives to check the files of 29 politicians for possible collaboration.

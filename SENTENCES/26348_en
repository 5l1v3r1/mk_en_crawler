BELGRADE, Serbia -- EULEX signed a protocol for co-operation with the Serbian Interior Ministry on Friday (September 11th), EULEX spokesperson Christophe Lamfalussy announced. 
The document will become effective on September 19th. 
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that the document deals with police co-operation and does not contain "a single word that has anything to do with politics". 
He explained that the document regulates co-operation in the fight against organised crime, the illegal drug trade and all other forms of cross-border crime between the two countries.
Meanwhile, several NGOs in Kosovo announced that they plan to hold a rally in Pristina on September 16th against the protocol. 
"Together, we will say no to the violation of Kosovo's sovereignty. 
This is a no to EULEX, not to the EU," the organisations said in a statement.

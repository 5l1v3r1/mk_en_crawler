PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Former UNMIK employee Callixte Mbarushimana was arrested on Tuesday (October 12th) in Paris on suspicion of committing serious war crimes in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Several years ago, Mbarushimana spent six months working as an electronic data processor in the UNMIK Office in Gjilan, western Kosovo. 
The alleged leader of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda was arrested after a secret order released two weeks ago from the International Criminal Court in The Hague. 
Although Mbarushimana was arrested in Kosovo in 2001, he was released in less than a month because Rwanda failed to properly prepare his indictment. 
After his release on June 12th 2001, he headed to Paris, where he was granted political asylum.

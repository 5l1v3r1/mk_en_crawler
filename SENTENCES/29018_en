NEW YORK, United States -- A Bosnian immigrant has pleaded not guilty to charges of planning a terrorist attack on the New York subway system.
Adis Medunjanin, 26, appeared on Friday (August 6th) before a Federal Court in Brooklyn after the indictment against him was amended to include new charges.
Medunjanin has been charged along with two other people with plotting to bomb the subway in September 2009.
Two of the suspects have already pleaded guilty.
Medunjanin, who lives in New York, was arrested in January.

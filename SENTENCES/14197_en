TIRANA, Albania -- Tirana began hosting a three-day regional conference Tuesday (14 March), sponsored by the US Defence Department, ahead of a joint drill aimed at improving interoperability in dealing with emergency situations. 
Participants from Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania are attending, as well as representatives of Armenia, Denmark and Serbia-Montenegro, who are there in an observational capacity. 
The planned joint military exercise is to be held in May and would simulate simultaneous flooding and terrorist acts at a port.
In other news, Albania and the United States sealed an agreement Tuesday providing for $2.5m in assistance for mine-clearing activities in the Balkan country. 
The project will continue for 18 months.
Also Tuesday, senior Finnish parliamentary official Jari Vilen visited Tirana and urged the main Albanian political parties to stop arguing and start working together. 
Legislative work has ground to a halt due to the wrangling.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Statements at the weekend by Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Italian counterpart Giorgo Napolitano suggest that recent tension in bilateral ties is subsiding, according to local press reports Monday (February 19th). 
Relations were strained last week after Mesic criticised Napolitano's remark regarding WWII crimes commited by Tito's guerillas against Italians in Croatia. 
He accused Napolitano of racism. 
Italy in turn implied that Croatia might face problems in EU accession negotiations if such issues were not resolved. 
Now, both presidents' offices have issued statements saying neither wanted to revisit arguments regarding the peace agreements between the two countries after WWII. 
Both also expressed a readiness to continue dialogue and partnership.

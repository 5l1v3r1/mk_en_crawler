SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Karl Lamers, head of a delegation from NATO's Parliamentary Assembly political commission, says BiH has achieved significant progress towards membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme. 
Speaking on Thursday (27 October) in Sarajevo, Lamers said the political commission would support BiH's bid for membership in PfP during the next session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, from 11 November to 16 November.
For her part, Seada Palavic, deputy chairwoman of the BiH parliamentary commission for defence and security, said she hopes NATO will invite BiH to join the programme in November.

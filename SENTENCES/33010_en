ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Tuesday (24 June) that his government would allow members of the US-led coalition to use Turkish ports and facilities in the rebuilding of Iraq. 
He added that since the decision was made within the framework of the UN Security Council resolution on the reconstruction and humanitarian aid for Iraq, it requires no parliamentary approval. 
Gul also announced that his government would allow foreign peacekeepers to use military bases in Turkey, likely the southern air base of Incirlik and the Mediterranean port of Mersin, due to their proximity to the Iraqi border. 
The offer apparently refers to the passage of troops and the transiting and storage of equipment.

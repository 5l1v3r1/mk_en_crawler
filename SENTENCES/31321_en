PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier was quoted as saying on Wednesday (December 1st) that the UN supports dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and will be involved in it. 
"For me, it is important to periodically send reports to the UN Security Council on how the dialogue is progressing and we will see how to prepare for these talks," Zannier said. 
Zannier met with State Secretary in the Serbian Ministry for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic in northern Mitrovica. 
Ivanovic said UNMIK's role in the talks is very important. 
He added the UN and UNMIK are the only organisations accepted by both sides and as such are irreplaceable for unresolved issues. 
The talks are expected to begin in February.

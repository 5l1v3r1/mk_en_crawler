SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Council of Ministers Chairman Nikola Spiric appealed to parliament Thursday (March 13th) to approve the police reform laws as soon as possible.
He expressed disappointment that no consensus exists on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), which, he views, as second only to the Dayton Peace Accord in terms of importance.
Failure to adopt the reform laws would prevent the signing of the SAA in April, as proposed by the EU.
At Thursday's state-level government session, the cabinet ordered respective ministries to prepare a project for integration by May 8th.
Part of the document is to set a timetable for the implementation of reforms stemming from the SAA.
They suffered a setback earlier this week when a parliamentary panel rejected the draft law on the directorate for the co-ordination of police forces and support agencies, as well as the draft law on independent and supervisory bodies for police.

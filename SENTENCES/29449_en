ATHENS, Greece -- An explosion rocked the Swiss Embassy in Athens on Tuesday (November 2nd), though no casualties were immediately reported.
Earlier in the day, the Bulgarian Embassy notified police of a suspicious package it had received, sending bomb squads over to the building.
The incidents came a day after four parcels containing explosives were seized in Athens.
One of them addressed, to the Mexican Embassy, exploded in the hands of a worker, who was hospitalised with burns.
Two Greek men, aged 22 and 24, were arrested near the scene in downtown Athens.
Police say the men were armed and disguised.
The three unexploded bombs were found at another delivery service and in the backpacks of the suspects.
The packages were addressed to the embassies of the Netherlands, Belgium and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Parliament is ready to support the opening of negotiations between the EU and BiH on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), according to Elmar Brok, chairman of the EP foreign affairs committee. 
Leading an EP delegation to Sarajevo that met with BiH Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Security Barisa Colak on Thursday (7 April), Brok praised the progress BiH is making. 
But he called for more efforts to implement reforms necessary for launching SAA talks and fulfilling the criteria for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
On a related note, High Representative Paddy Ashdown and EU security chief Javier Solana agreed in Brussels Thursday that after nine years of obstruction, Republika Srpska is demonstrating constructive co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
They commended the recent voluntary surrenders, but again called for the arrest of fugitives Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic.

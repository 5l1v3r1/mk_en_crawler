SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia City Court refused to allow the outlawed OMO Ilinden-Pirin to register as a political party on Tuesday (October 31st). 
The group had requested to register as the political party United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden -- Party for Economic Development and Population Integration. 
According to the court, a number of registration requirements were not met.
OMO Ilinden was registered as political party in 1999. 
In municipal elections the following year it won two local governor seats. 
Several months later, however, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court pronounced the party illegitimate. 
That decision was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which later ruled in favour of OMO Ilinden.

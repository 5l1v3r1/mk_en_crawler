TIRANA, Albania -- Romania on Tuesday (October 21st) ratified the protocol of Albania's NATO membership, becoming the Alliance's sixth member state to do so.
Albania received in April an invitation to join the Alliance, pending completion of the ratification process.
Senior NATO officials recently urged members to accelerate it.
Albania is expected to become a full-fledged member at NATO's spring summit.

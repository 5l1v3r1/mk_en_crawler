SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The number of employees in Macedonia's public administration sector will be reduced by 1,000 this year, according to Finance Minister Nikola Popovski.
Local media quoted him Monday (9 August) as saying the reductions would be carried out through retirements and closure of job vacancies. 
He cited the Macedonian government's commitments to the IMF, which include trimming the number of public sector employees by 2,000 before the end of this year, in order to reduce budget expenditures by 4 per cent annually.

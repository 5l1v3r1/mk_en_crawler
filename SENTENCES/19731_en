PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel visited Pristina on Thursday (October 25th) and insisted that the EU has not abandoned former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence of the province. 
He, however, insisted that the 14-point document, proposed by the international troika at last week's round of final status negotiations, aims to close the gap between Belgrade and Pristina and provides an even better basis for compromise. 
Rupel added that despite different stances within the EU regarding Kosovo, he expects Union members to come up with a common position on the province's future after negotiations end in December.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown on Friday (28 October) lifted some of the financial restrictions imposed on Republika Srpska's (RS) ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS) earlier this year, citing the progress achieved by RS in co-operation with The Hague tribunal as well as improved SDS control over party finances. 
Ashdown confirmed he has lifted a ban on incoming payments to SDS from public sources, backdating the move to 1 October. 
However, he added, the funds collected will remain frozen unless fugitive war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic is arrested and extradited to the UN war crimes tribunal by the end of the year.
Also on Friday, Ashdown discharged RS Education and Culture Minister Milovan Pecelj, citing non-compliance with an earlier ruling that required the dismissal of the dean of the University of Eastern Sarajevo's law school. 
In addition, Ashdown announced a new legal procedure has been set in place on the renaming of public facilities of an international or inter-entity character. 
The move is intended to forestall problems such as the recent dispute over a proposed renaming of Sarejevo's international airport in honour of the late Bosniak leader Alija Izetbegovic.

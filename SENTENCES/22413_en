BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, on Thursday (September 11th) confirmed that some information war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic submitted for his ID card application is missing.
Ljajic said that in 1999, Mladic submitted an application for an ID card in Serbia, which had granted him citizenship, but that some documentation, including his fingerprints, has disappeared.
He added that authorities are investigating the matter.
Local media reports say the fingerprints are vital in proving whether Mladic, like Radovan Karadzic before him, is using an assumed identity and documents.

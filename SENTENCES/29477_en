ATHENS, Greece -- Truck drivers decided on Sunday (August 1st) to terminate a six-day strike that left petrol stations in short supply across the country. 
The decision was taken with a narrow majority at a four-hour meeting of the Federation of Overland Commercial Transporters. 
The drivers were set to start returning to their jobs early Monday. 
The action began in protest against the government's plans to liberalise the transport sector by opening it to new licenses, a process that has been frozen for decades. 
According to the plan, the liberalisation is to begin in September.

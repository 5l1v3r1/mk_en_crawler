SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A ceremony held on Friday (December 1st) marked the first Day of the Joint BiH Armed Forces. 
In a speech, the BiH Presidency's Serb member, Chairman Nikola Radmanovic, praised those involved in the defence reform process, stressing that the best indication of success was NATO's recent invitation to join the Partnership for Peace programme.
In other news, Dirk Lange, head of the BiH unit of the European Commission Western Balkans directorate, called on officials Saturday to push ahead with talks on police reform. 
Lack of progress on the issue is the main obstacle to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), he noted. 
If signed this winter, the SAA could be in effect by summer.

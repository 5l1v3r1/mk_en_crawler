MADEIRA, Portugal -- NATO Parliamentary Assembly President Jose Lello listed Kosovo and Afghanistan as the Pact's top priorities, as he opened the four-day spring session in Madeira, Portugal on Friday (May 25th).
According to Lello, the Kosovo status settlement process, currently under way at the UN Security Council is "significant for Alliance security and will have far-reaching consequences for stability in the region and in Europe".
As for Afghanistan, he said the continuing presence of the Alliance would be the "best hope for the Afghan people and is also a decisive test for NATO to live up to its new role".
On Saturday, the Assembly approved associate member status for Montenegro.
The country was admitted to the Partnership for Peace programme a few months ago.

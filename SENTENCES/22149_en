BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Friday (October 17th) told representatives of the major political parties that a 50% pay hike for all public servants is unaffordable and would precipitate an economic crisis. 
Tariceanu met with party officials to discuss wages in the public sector after the Constitutional Court deemed the law granting teachers a 50% wage hike constitutional. 
Last month's decision by parliament to increase teachers' wages triggered protests by other public servants demanding similar raises.

ATHENS, Greece -- The highest EU court ruled on Tuesday (25 October) that feta cheese is a traditional Greek product deserving special protection.
Germany and Denmark, backed by France and Britain, had fought the designation of origin for nearly 20 years.
The decision of the European Court of Justice would force Danish and German producers to use a different name for their white cheese.

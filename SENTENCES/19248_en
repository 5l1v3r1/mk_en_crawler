PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Serbian National Council (SNC), the most influential Serb NGO in Kosovo, called on Russian peacekeepers Wednesday (February 27th) to return to the former Serbian province.
Moscow withdrew its troops from the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo in mid 2003, four years after they were deployed.
In other news, dozens of Serb police officers in Kosovo's Gniljane region skipped work on Wednesday to protest the February 17th unilateral declaration of independence.
Serbian Infrastructure Minister Velimir Ilic said establishing a separate police force in parts of Kosovo heavily populated by Serbs is part of his government's action plan.

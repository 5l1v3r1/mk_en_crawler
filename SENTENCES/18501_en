TETOVO, Macedonia -- Former members of the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA) held a rally in Tetovo on Saturday (December 9th), demanding that authorities settle their status. 
Some 100 demonstrators participated in the rally, seeking pensions and state aid for the families of rebels killed or disabled during the 2001 interethnic conflict. 
The main ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union for Integration recently urged the government to adopt a special law determining the status of the rebels, similar to the one settling the status of government troops in that conflict.

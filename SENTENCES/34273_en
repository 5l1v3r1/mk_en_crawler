ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government said Monday (30 June) that it would appoint a defence attorney to represent Gen Ante Gotovina before the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Zagreb lawyer Goran Mikulic, who also represented the government in the case of the late Gen Janko Bobetko, will likely be tapped during the cabinet's next session. 
The retired general has been hiding for two years since the tribunal unsealed an indictment for war crimes committed against Serb civilians in a 1995 Croatian Army operation. 
Last month he indicated he might surrender.

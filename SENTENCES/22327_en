ANKARA, Turkey -- The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party on Wednesday (July 16th) proposed cutting the 10% electoral threshold.
If approved, the bill will allow parties that gain at least 1% in general elections to receive government funding.
Critics say the restriction blocks fair representation in parliament.
It also mostly affects pro-Kurdish parties.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Wednesday (November 14th) it is giving Romania one more month to fix its Agriculture Payment and Intervention Agency (APIA), extending the deadline to December 16th. 
The EC said Romania could face implementation of a safeguard clause unless it corrects issues with the software system used to administer and control direct aid the EU grants to Romanian farmers. 
The EC will make its final decision on whether to activate that safeguard clause on December 20th. 
Applying it would mean the loss of 110m euros for Romania.

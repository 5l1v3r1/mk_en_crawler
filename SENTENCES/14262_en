BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission reportedly has voiced readiness to open Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with BiH as soon as a deal for restructuring the country's police sector in line with three set EU principles is reached, local media reported late Monday (12 September).
According to the Fena news agency, negotiations on police reform that resumed Monday were suspended later that evening after Brussels' offer was made known.
The RS Parliament was due to hold an emergency session Tuesday to consider the latest developments.
In other news, a new statewide organisation has been established in BiH to determine the fate of people still missing from the 1992-1995 war.
The Missing Persons Institute pledges to pool -- for the first time ever -- the resources of all three ethnic groups in this effort.
It also plans to set up a central database that would account more accurately for victims.

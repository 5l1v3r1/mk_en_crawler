ANKARA, Turkey -- People in Turkey may say "no" to EU membership just like the Norwegians did, President Abdullah Gul warned ahead of a visit to Austria that starts Monday (May 2nd). 
The warning came in three interviews with leading Austrian media. 
"Referendums will take place when Turkey comes to the point of becoming a member. 
We respect referendums. 
The path leading to the EU is a long process," Gul stated. 
He recalled that the EU made a common decision in 2005 to start accession talks with Turkey and said the bloc "should be true to this". 
While in Vienna, Gul will attend a Turkish-Austrian business forum.

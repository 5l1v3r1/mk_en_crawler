PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serb leaders in Kosovo said Wednesday (2 February) that Belgrade was excluded from discussions on the province's decentralisation process, conducted by the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo in Pristina earlier in the day. 
According to Serb representative Goran Bogdanovic, who attended the Pristina meeting, Contact Group members made it clear that Belgrade could provide advice and assistance to the Kosovo Serbs, but could not directly participate in the decentralisation process. 
Separately, influential Kosovo Albanian politicians voiced dissatisfaction with the decentralisation proposals, saying the plan would deepen ethnic division.

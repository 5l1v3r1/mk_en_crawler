ATHENS, Greece -- Another Danish company announced on Sunday (May 30th) it is withdrawing its products from the Greek market after the government decided to cut medicine prices by 25%.
Leo Pharma said it decided to stop offering two popular drugs because the price cuts would cause job losses across Europe.
Days earlier, another Danish company, Novo Nordisk, withdrew the sales of 17 types of medication for treating diabetes for the same reason.
The government criticises the moves as unfair.
Others describe it as blackmail, since the firms essentially monopolise the market for certain key drugs.

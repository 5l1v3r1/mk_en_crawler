PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Central Bank chief economist Nikola Fabris said on Saturday (August 29th) that his country needs additional money and getting it from the IMF would be the cheapest way to go. 
"By joining the IMF programme, we would gain access to additional funds from the World Bank and the EU. 
Therefore, I think that we should enter this arrangement, although I do understand opponents ... 
who are afraid it would limit our abilities to conduct an independent economic policy," Fabris told the Podgorica-based daily Dan. 
So far, the government has avoided an agreement with the IMF because of the Fund's strict requirements, especially those aimed at slashing public spending.

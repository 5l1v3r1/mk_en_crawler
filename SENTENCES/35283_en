ATHENS, Greece -- Britain is confident in the Greek authorities' ability to protect British athletes during the Summer Olympics, according to David Vennes, Scotland Yard's head for security and international terrorism.
In an interview broadcast Thursday (22 April), Vennes described co-operation with the Greek security establishment as "outstanding".
In other news, Greek Police Chief Fotis Nassiakos said Thursday that there is no information to suggest that al-Qaeda is planning attacks during the Summer Games.
But he urged police to remain vigilant.
Also Thursday, Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis and Transport Minister Mihalis Liapis met to discuss security operations in Athens.
Liapis stressed the desire to maintain an aura of celebration while safeguarding the Games.
Meanwhile, the Greek travel industry says that an anticipated boom in hotel bookings ahead of the Olympics has failed to materialise.
In fact, the Panhellenic Federation of Hoteliers reports a steep decline in hotel reservations in the first four months of 2004.

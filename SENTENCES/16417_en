SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian border police discovered a large illegal arms depot near the Skopje village of Blace on Saturday (13 May), the interior ministry announced. 
Weapons and explosives were packed and hidden in a cave in the region, according a ministry statement.
In other news, the interior ministry is denying media speculation about a new possible security threat related to a supposed concentration of armed ethnic Albanians in the Tetovo villages of Neraste and Neprosteno. 
Media reports have alleged that a group of Albanians from Kosovo was seeking to destabilise Macedonia ahead of the 5 July parliamentary elections. 
The interior ministry says there is no intelligence information to back such claims.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court confirmed on Friday (October 13th) an indictment against a former Bosniak paramilitary member, Niset Ramic, who is accused of committing war crimes against Serb civilians in the Visoko municipality in June 1992. 
He is currently serving a 20-year prison term for another crime. 
The new proceedings against him followed an open letter he wrote to the press in February, saying he wanted to confess all his actions and disclose the names of the Visoko victims.
Separately Friday, the BiH Court also confirmed an indictment against a former member of the Serbian military, Radmilo Vukovic, charged with war crimes against the civilian population in Foca -- specifically, the torture and rape of a Bosniak woman in June 1992.

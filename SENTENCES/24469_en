PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Parliament (EP) member Doris Pack on Tuesday (April 7th) voiced support for Kosovo's EU integration but at the same time expressed disappointment with the government's efforts to fight corruption. 
Pack, who is leading an EP delegation to Pristina, signed a co-operation agreement Tuesday with members of parliament. 
Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said the EP delegation confirmed its commitment to boost collaboration with Kosovo's parliament and to ensure clear EU prospects for Kosovo.
Also on Tuesday, EP member Angelika Beer said institutions in Serbia must understand that the EU integration process cannot be achieved through division but rather through mutual recognition. 
"Thus, if Serbia wants to join the EU, it must recognise Kosovo's independence," Beer said after meeting with President Fatmir Sejdiu in Pristina.
Gambia, meanwhile, became the 57th country to recognise Kosovoâs independence, according to a statement issued by its embassy in Washington on Tuesday.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Speaking to a meeting of the Confederation of Turkish Labour Unions on Thursday (December 6th), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said parliament would pass the controversial social security reform bill.
He insisted that during the drafting process, the government took into consideration the opinions of all interested parties.
The announced reforms are not popular with various labour unions, mainly because of a proposal to remove severance pay for certain sectors.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Sunday (May 23rd) that EU officials assured him recently the bloc will accelerate the enlargement process after the world economic crisis eases.
He blamed the stalemate in the integration of new members on the shift in EU focus to its economic troubles.
Tadic also said he expects next month's EU-Western Balkans summit in Sarajevo to give new momentum to various bids.
Serbia filed its membership application in December, hopes for EU candidate status by June 2011 and to start accession talks in 2012.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament wrapped up debate Monday (May 14th) on a new bill on cabinet ministries, submitted by the newly formed democratic majority of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia coalition and G17 Plus.
The draft envisions boosting the number of ministries from 18 to 22.
After a likely vote on that Tuesday, lawmakers are expected to debate and vote on the new coalition government of Prime Minister-designate Vojislav Kostunica.
If the MPs fail to endorse it, new parliamentary elections will have to be called.

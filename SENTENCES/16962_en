STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution Tuesday (October 3rd), urging the international community and the EU in particular to assume greater responsibility for the democratic development of the Western Balkans. 
The document stressed the need for a "clear road map for EU integration" and urged the EU to remove the current visa restrictions on countries in the region.
Prior to the adoption of the resolution, the PACE deputies heard speeches by Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and his BiH counterpart, Adnan Terzic. 
Both expressed concerns that Europe was losing interest in the Western Balkan hopefuls.

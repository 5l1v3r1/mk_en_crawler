ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's top administrative court, the Council of States, rejected on Wednesday (November 25th) a government-supported decision that would have allowed imams -- students who graduated from religious secondary schools -- to go on to university.
The Istanbul Bar Association challenged the move after the Higher Education Board approved it in July.
Wednesday's court decision cited concerns the practice could result in serious and irreversible consequences to the Turkish educational system.

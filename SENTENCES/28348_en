ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Thursday (May 13th) it is establishing a crisis committee to deal with thousands of cancelled tourist bookings that have followed violent protests in Athens. 
Government spokesman George Petalotis estimates the cancellations have cost the country tens of millions of euros in losses. 
Earlier in the day, the Athens Hoteliers Union announced that since May 5th, when three people died in a fire caused by protesters in the capital, nearly 17,000 bookings have been cancelled. 
That number is climbing, despite the approaching summer travel season.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Although six high-level indictees remain at large, The Hague war crimes tribunal is a successful initiative that has achieved remarkable results, chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Thursday (February 8th).
Addressing an international conference in Zagreb on establishing the truth about wars and war crimes, del Ponte noted that presidents, prime ministers and senior military commanders had been brought before the tribunal, and the most serious crimes, the massacres in Srebrenica and Ovcara, were and are being addressed.
Del Ponte used the opportunity to again recommend that the tribunal's mandate, set to expire in 2010, be extended.

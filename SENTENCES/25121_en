DAVOS, Switzerland -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday (January 29th) that the grave financial crisis that has hit his country could happen to any European state.
In an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore from Davos, where he attended the World Economic Forum, Papandreou reiterated that Athens will not seek the EU's help in dealing with its situation, and will not quit the eurozone.
He stressed that Greece has already begun implementing a set of austerity measures aimed at ending the crisis.
On Thursday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso urged Greece to meet obligations to its EU partners and bring its double-digit budget deficit within the bloc's 3% of GDP ceiling.
EU Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Joaquin Almunia says Greece will not become insolvent.
"There is no such thing as insolvency in the eurozone," he said at the Davos forum, reiterating that Athens will not exit the eurozone.

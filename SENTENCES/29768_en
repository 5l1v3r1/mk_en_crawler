TIRANA, Albania -- Edi Rama, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP), is defying calls from the international community to cancel demonstrations planned for Friday (January 28th) and will be heading the crowd gathered outside the government building. 
Rama said on Thursday that the rally will be a tribute to the three people killed a week ago during another protest organised by the opposition. 
The protesters will carry candles and flowers, Rama said.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha cancelled a pro-government protest, planned for Saturday, after the international community urged parties to look for a political solution to the governing crisis instead of bringing large crowds into the streets.
Tirana police, meanwhile, warned on Thursday that they cannot guarantee Friday's rally will run smoothly. 
They described the protest as a threat to national security and public safety. 
Barbed wire has reportedly been installed to protect important state buildings.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis denied a report in the <I>New York Times</I> that said his government has granted the United States permission to deploy troops on Turkish territory.
Yakis said Tuesday (21 January) that while Turkish military officials were free to contact their US colleagues, this did not suggest an agreement was in place.
He added that he did not believe parliament would grant such permission.
On Thursday, the government will host a regional summit on Iraq in Istanbul.
In other news, an Ankara-based court on Tuesday dropped charges against ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He had been accused of illegally acquiring property.
This was only one of several trials that have been launched against Erdogan, who is also under investigation for alleged corruption during his term as Istanbul mayor.
He was removed from the post in 1998 for promoting Islamist values.

ATHENS, Greece -- The Federation of Greek Sailors decided on Saturday (November 27th) to extend its strike until Tuesday, leaving sea connections from the mainland to the islands blocked.
The protest, which started last Tuesday, is aimed at reaching a collective labour agreement that won't deprive sailors of any benefits or rights.
Crete, the country's biggest island, is affected most by the action.
Agricultural products shipped there are being blocked in the ports.
Many of the 100 islands have no air connections.
Ferryboats to Italy, however, are not affected.
The federation and its 20,000 members have warned they will continue their protest beyond Tuesday, unless ship owners satisfy their demands.

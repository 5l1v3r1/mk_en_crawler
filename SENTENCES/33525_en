LONDON, England -- Parliament will ratify Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU only after the arrest or voluntary surrender of war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina, according to British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane. 
He reiterated that stance during talks Tuesday (23 September) with his Croatian counterpart, Neven Mimica. 
The two met to discuss Croatia's progress towards EU integration. 
Noting significant headway towards full membership in the Union, MacShane stressed that Gotovina's detention is crucial to meeting the political criteria.
In other news, Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic is to meet Thursday with UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte at The Hague. 
She too recently insisted that Croatia arrest and hand over Gotovina.

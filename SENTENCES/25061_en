ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors pressed charges Saturday (November 28th) against three army officers suspected of involvement in a plot to topple the government.
The three are accused of "membership in a terrorist organisation".
Prosecutors are investigating their links to a secret weapons depot, found in April at an army firing ground near Istanbul.
The army said the ammunition and weapons found there did not belong to it.

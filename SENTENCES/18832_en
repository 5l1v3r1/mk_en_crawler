BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic says he expects his visit to Brussels Tuesday (March 6th) to focus on outlining the direction of bilateral ties with the EU in the months ahead.
On Saturday, Tadic said he expects this round of regularly scheduled political talks to focus on frozen Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations with the EU, the formation of a new Serbian government, the Kosovo status process and Serbia's level of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Tadic stressed that any indictee hiding from justice is protecting his own interests and harming those of Serbia.
Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte has written to German Chancellor Angela Merkel urging the German presidency of the EU to keep pressure on Serbia to arrest indictees.
Del Ponte says she urged Merkel not to reopen SAA talks until Ratko Mladic and other fugitives are arrested and transferred to the UN court in The Hague.

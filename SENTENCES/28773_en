PARIS, France -- An internal letter issued this summer by the French Interior Ministry was leaked to the media Saturday (September 11th) and appears to contradict recent government statements insisting that its controversial expulsions of illegal immigrants did not target the Roma. 
The note, sent to prefects in the beginning of August, said that "within three months, 300 illegal camps are to be dismantled, predominantly those of the Roma." Just last Thursday, Immigration Minister Eric Besson said the crackdown did not specifically target Roma. 
"The treatment given these people has no connection with their real or supposed membership of the Roma community," Besson said, amid growing international criticism against the expulsion of hundreds of Roma to their homelands: Bulgaria and Romania. 
On Friday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by phone with Romanian counterpart Traian Basescu. 
They agreed "to provide an efficient response to the problem posed by the integration of the Roma", Sarkozy's office announced.

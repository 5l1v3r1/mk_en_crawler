SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragan Covic, the Croat member of BiH's tripartite presidency, said Wednesday (23 March) he would not resign his post despite his indictment on corruption charges.
Covic's trial is due to start on 30 March.
Paddy Ashdown, the top international representative in BiH, and EU and US officials have called for his resignation.
The judiciary is affected as well, since Mato Tadic, the president of the Constitutional Court, is a co-defendant in the case.

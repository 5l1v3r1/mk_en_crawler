ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou ruled out on Sunday (May 23rd) the option of defaulting on the public debt or restructuring that debt. 
In an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais, Papandreou said the government has decided instead to pay back the loans Greece took out. 
He also welcomed efforts by the EU to prevent the Greek crisis from spreading into other countries using the euro, though he chided "The EU took a while to understand that the attack of speculators in Greece is only a first step before an attack on other countries and the threat to stability throughout the euro area."

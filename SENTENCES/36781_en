TIRANA, Albania -- The parliamentary commission on electoral reform started working Monday (19 July).
Jemin Gjana from the major opposition Democratic Party and Elmaz Sherifi from the ruling Socialist Party were elected co-chairmen.
The junior parties in parliament boycotted the meeting and are not represented.
"The commission is made up of 16 members and we were voted by nine members present in the meeting, which constitute the majority," said Gjana, responding to accusations from the junior parties.

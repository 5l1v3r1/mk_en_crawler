BELGRADE, Serbia -- The EU Council of Ministers said on Monday (December 8th) that while Serbia has made progress in co-operating with The Hague war crimes tribunal, full co-operation is necessary for ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia. 
The Netherlands insists that it will not allow closer integration until the arrest and Hague prosecution of fugitive Ratko Mladic and that it will use its veto power if necessary. 
Serbia hopes to receive official EU candidate status next year.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal is allowing former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to filed an appeal against the appointment of Britain's Richard Harvey as his lawyer, local media reported on Wednesday (January 13th).
The court has decided that a ruling by the Appeals Chamber will accelerate proceedings against Karadzic, whose first request was rejected last month.
Karadzic said he wants a lawyer who shares his cultural tradition and language.
His trial started on October 27th but was suspended until March, due to his refusal to attend the sessions.

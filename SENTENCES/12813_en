SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Local media are reporting that High Representative Paddy Ashdown will visit Belgrade on Wednesday (5 January) for talks with senior officials about problems in Republika Srpska (RS) and the need for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Last month, Serbian leaders were strongly critical of measures Ashdown imposed on RS as a result of its failure to meet its international obligations.
On Tuesday, the RS Interior Ministry said co-operation with the tribunal and apprehending war crimes suspects would be priorities in 2005.
Also Tuesday, talks resumed among RS's largest parties about forming a new entity cabinet, in the wake of Ashdown's sanctions.
No agreement was reached, however, and some parties are now attaching conditions to their participation in the cabinet, which must be formed by Saturday.

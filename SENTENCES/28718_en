BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities said on Monday (October 11th) that hooligan attacks in Belgrade during Sunday's Gay Pride Parade were organised and politically inspired. 
Police Director Milorad Veljovic said one of the main masterminds appears to have been Mladen Obradovic, leader of the ultranationalist group Obraz. 
Police have detained him and have a list of suspected riot organisers. 
Justice Minister Snezana Malovic concurs that the violence was orchestrated. 
About 250 people were detained for violent behaviour during and after Sunday's protests. 
More than 140 police officers were injured during clashes with thousands of far-right supporters and football fans. 
Hooligans attacked the headquarters of the ruling Democratic Party and the Socialist Party of Serbia, which makes politicians suspect political motivations. 
The opposition Serbian Progressive Party condemned the violence and said the perpetrators should be brought to justice. 
Another opposition party -- the Democratic Party of Serbia -- said authorities are responsible for the violence as they failed to restore peace and order. 
The Radicals also blamed authorities, arguing they should not have allowed the parade.

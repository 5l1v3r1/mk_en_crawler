BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor's office in Belgrade said on Thursday (December 24th) it is investigating five former police officers for suspected involvement in war crimes against non-Serb civilians in Croatia.
Prosecutors say the five may have killed at least six civilians in the northeast town of Beli Manastir in 1991.
Other allegations against them include torture, intimidation and terror.
Four of the suspects have been arrested, while one remains at large.
The case was tuned over by Croatia.

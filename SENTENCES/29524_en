SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the EU mission warned that parliament's failure to adopt a law on holding a national population census risks further isolation of the country.
Their statement came on Friday (July 30th), one day after the main party in Republika Srpska, the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), walked out of a parliamentary session, leaving it without the quorum needed to approve the legislation.
All other parties in the state-level parliament, including the other Serb parties, were ready to support the bill.
The SNSD, however, opposed a clause stipulating that power sharing among the three main ethnic communities will continue to be based on a census held just months before the 1992-95 war and that the situation will remain so until the refugee return process is finalised.
If BiH succeeds in holding a census next year, it will be the first since the war.
The countries' political parties have been haggling over the issue for more than a year.

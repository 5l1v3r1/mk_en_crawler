BELGRADE, Serbia -- The police announced on Saturday (December 19th) that they arrested three more hooligans, after thousands chanted threats and insults against B92 reporter Brankica Stankovic during a football match between Partizan Belgrade and Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday.
Three other arrests were made previously in the case.
Stankovic also received threats via Facebook after reporting on criminal activities involving leaders of football fan groups in Serbia.
Meanwhile, a soccer hooligan was convicted on Friday of first-degree murder.
Bojan Hrvatin, 24, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for stabbing a fan of a rival club to death in a brawl in 2006.
Judges at the Belgrade District Court ruled that the attack that happened on a train had been planned in advance.

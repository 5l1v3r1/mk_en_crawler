BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb Deputy Finance Minister Zarko Mionic told reporters on Tuesday (16 September) that the entity's public debt has reached 971m euros. 
This amounts to 60 per cent of Republika Srpska's GDP.
In other news, local and international experts completed work Tuesday on a draft law that would merge the intelligence services of the two entities in BiH. 
Paddy Ashdown said it would demonstrate that leaders are serious about fighting organised crime and terrorists.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb Minister for Refugees Jasmin Samardzic said the government is committed to returning the property of all refugees by year's end. 
According to official data, 85 per cent of abandoned properties have been returned to their original owners.
In The Hague, meanwhile, a judge entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of former Bosnian Serb prison guard Mitar Rasevic. 
He had refused to enter a plea of his own.

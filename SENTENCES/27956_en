BELGRADE, Serbia -- Slobodan Milosevic's son, Marko, has received political refugee status in Russia, Prosecutor's Office spokesman Tomo Zoric said on Wednesday (September 22nd). 
Zoric added that regardless, Marko Milosevic will be arrested immediately if he turns up in Serbia or any other country, as the arrest warrant issued for him remains in effect. 
Serbia has been investigating Milosevic's son for cigarette smuggling between 1996 and 2001. 
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor's Office announced it has decided to amend charges against Marko Milosevic's mother, Mirjana Markovic, to prevent them from expiring. 
The former first lady is charged with abuse of office for illegally allocating a state-owned apartment to her grandchild's babysitter in 2000.

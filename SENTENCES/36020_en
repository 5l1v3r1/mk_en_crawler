BUERGENSTOCK, Switzerland -- Turkish and Greek leaders, facing a three-day deadline to strike a peace deal uniting Cyprus in time for EU membership on 1 May, will meet on Monday (29 March).
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has taken personal charge of the four-party talks with Greece, Turkey, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
He is expected to submit a final version of the reunification plan on Monday.
Negotiators are expected to approve it by Wednesday, clearing the way for a referendum on the final draft in Cyprus on 20 April.
The plan is expected to restrict the number of Greek Cypriots allowed to resettle in northern Cyprus and to provide for the continued but reduced presence of Turkish troops on the island.

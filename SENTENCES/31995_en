SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Activities related to implementing the election results in BiH have intensified in recent days, now that more than six weeks have passed since the general elections. 
The BiH Parliament's House of Representatives will hold its constituent session on 3 December, while the inaugural meeting of the Republika Srpska (RS) Assembly will be held sooner, on Thursday. 
At the session, the 83 members of the Bosnian Serb Parliament will be sworn in, as well as newly elected RS President Dragan Cavic. 
He will then have ten days to nominate a prime minister.

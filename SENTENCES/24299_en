TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling coalition led by the Democratic Party on Monday (May 11th) opposed the appointment of Audrey Glover as head of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) mission, to monitor the June 28th parliamentary elections. 
Glover headed the mission between 1994 and 1997 as well. 
In 1996, the same right-wing coalition criticised her report on May elections as "unreal".

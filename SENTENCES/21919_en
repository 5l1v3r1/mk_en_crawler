NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias is expected to propose a rotating island-wide presidency and vice presidency when he meets on Friday (July 25th) with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. 
According to media reports Tuesday, under Christofias's plan, the future central state would have one sovereignty, one citizenship, one economy and one international identity, while the two communities would have political equality. 
Christofias also will insist on demilitarising the island, reducing the number of Turkish settlers and restoring the property of Greek Cypriots who left the northern part after Turkish troops arrived in 1974. 
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, however, insist the solution must be based on two equal states and two equal communities, the daily Cyprus Mail noted.

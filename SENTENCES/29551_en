BUCHAREST, Romania -- Senator Catalin Voicu of the Social Democratic Party was arrested late Tuesday (March 30th) on corruption charges.
Voicu will spend 30 days in custody, based on a decision by the high court.
Prosecutors say he accepted 260,000 euros in bribes from a businessman last summer, money he intended to use to pay bribe judges.
Early Wednesday, Voicu, who has denied all charges, was admitted to hospital with heart problems.

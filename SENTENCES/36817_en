SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling coalition partners reached an agreement on decentralisation after talks late Wednesday (14 July). 
The draft package of laws will be tabled and discussed at Thursday's government session; the opinions of Prime Minister Hari Kostov and Local Government Minister Alexandre Geshtakovski are considered key. 
Adoption by the government and approval by parliament must be fairly quick in order for local elections to proceed as scheduled this autumn.
In other news, parliament on Wednesday appointed Dane Iliev as chairman of the Macedonian Supreme Court. 
The main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE opposed Iliev's nomination and walked out before the vote.

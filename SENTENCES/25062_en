BRUSSELS, Belgium -- As expected, Croatia closed three more negotiation chapters of its acquis on Friday (November 27th) at an intergovernmental conference in Brussels. 
That makes 15 of the total 33 chapters. 
Croatia may close one or two more during the next conference scheduled for the second half of December. 
It also expects to open three negotiation chapters -- foreign, security and defence policy, environment and fisheries -- by the end of the year, and to open the last two early next year. 
Croatian authorities hope to complete accession negotiations by mid-2010.

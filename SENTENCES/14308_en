BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Saturday (10 December) that his country backs Moldovan authorities in efforts to resolve a continuing dispute with Russia over the separatist Moldovan Transdniester region.
He said Moldova must "have full control over its entire territory".
During a meeting with Moldovan counterpart Vladimir Voronin, both leaders voiced their disappointment with an OSCE summit in Ljubljana last week that failed to convince Russia to withdraw its troops from the Transdniester area.
In other news, a new poll suggests the ruling coalition between the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party (PD) retains its lead among Romania's political parties.
The results, widely quoted in the local press Monday, show that the PNL-PD alliance is still on top with 45 per cent of voter support.
Second is the major opposition Social Democratic Party with 32 per cent, followed by the Greater Romania party with 15 per cent.

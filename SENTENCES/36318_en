PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE on Tuesday (25 May) published a new report analysing the human rights situation in Kosovo. 
The report concludes that the mid-March riots further complicated the situation in the province. 
The report says several human rights challenges remain and urges that measures be undertaken in four major areas: security, the judiciary, property protection, and education and health services.

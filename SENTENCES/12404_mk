BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Italian Parliament will soon ratify the EU accession treaties of Romania and Bulgaria, Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini affirmed Thursday (9 June) in Bucharest. 
Meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, Fini said final procedures are under way for parliament to discuss the treaty. 
He added that in his view, the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands on the European Constitution should not affect the two countries' efforts for EU integration. 
Tariceanu, in turn, stressed Romania will meet all commitments made to the Union, in order to become a full member on 1 January 2007.

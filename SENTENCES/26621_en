PRISTINA, Kosovo -- German Lieutenant General Markus Bentler took over as commander of KFOR from his Italian predecessor, General Giuseppe Emilio Gay, on Tuesday (September 8th).
During the ceremony in Pristina, Bentler said that KFOR will continue its co-operation with Kosovo institutions and international missions.
KFOR plans to reduce its force from the current 14,000 to about 10,000 troops early next year, with further reductions to follow.
In other news, a blast was reported late Monday near a private house in the northern, Serb-dominated part of Mitrovica.
Police have found pieces of explosive at the site and have questioned witnesses.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu summoned on Tuesday (September 29th) the leaders of the two ruling coalition members -- the Social Democratic Party's (PSD) Mircea Geoana and Prime Minister Emil Boc, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), for talks. 
At issue are tensions within the coalition over the sacking this week of Interior Minister Dan Nica. 
Basescu told reporters afterwards that both Boc and Geoana had discredited the interior ministry for no reason, creating a lack of trust in law enforcement. 
Geoana, in turn, accused Basescu of orchestrating Boc's move to sack Nica because of comments he made about the potential for fraud in the upcoming November 22nd presidential election.

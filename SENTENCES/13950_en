SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The joint military commission for BiH -- including BiH, EUFOR and NATO representatives -- met at Camp Butmir on Tuesday (17 January) and said reducing the number of military facilities in the country would be a priority this year. 
The defence ministry briefed commission members on the planned timetable for reforms and restructuring. 
Participants also discussed issues related to the transfer of more responsibilities from EUFOR to BiH authorities.
In other news Tuesday, EUFOR announced that its troops found about three tonnes of arms and munitions hidden in an underground depot in Kozarska Dubica. 
A tip from someone in the community led them to the site.

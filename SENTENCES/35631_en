SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chairman of the Defence Reform Commission in BiH, James Locher, said Wednesday (7 April) that he believes BiH could meet all the criteria for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
At a news conference in Sarajevo, Locher said the country has met the military conditions.
It is the political conditions -- such as full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal -- that remain elusive, he said.
In other news, BiH Deputy Foreign Minister Lidija Ropic announced Wednesday that Sarajevo will host a forum of the defence ministers of the South East Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP) countries on 21 April.
The event will also mark the transfer of the one-year rotating SEECP presidency from BiH to Romania.

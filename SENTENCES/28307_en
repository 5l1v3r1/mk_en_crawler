SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Saturday (April 17th) that BiH's EU visa liberalisation process may be delayed by three or four months, beyond the summer timeframe.
"Some were hoping, including myself, that this will happen on July 1st, in the beginning of the holiday season," Inzko told Deutsche Welle.
He said that there is a certain degree of fatigue in European countries and institutions over the lack of progress in reforms.
He added that some European officials and experts believe that in the months before the October presidential and parliamentary elections, no significant progress can be expected in terms of implementing reforms.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri implied Tuesday (18 May) that he might step down from his post, according to B92 Radio.
"It remains to be seen," said Holkeri, whose yearlong mandate expires in August.
Last week, he was admitted to an intensive care unit in Strasbourg after feeling ill at a diplomatic dinner.
Holkeri, 67, was diagnosed as suffering from exhaustion and possible heart problems.

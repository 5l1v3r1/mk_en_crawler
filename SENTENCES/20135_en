PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Thursday (February 14th) urged Kosovo Albanians to celebrate Kosovo's independence in a dignified manner that sends a positive message to the world.
He stopped short of specifying an exact date for the declaration, though many expect it on Sunday.
In other news Thursday, a powerful explosion rattled the ethnically-divided town of Mitrovica.
The blast occurred in a house next to the EU offices in the Serb-controlled part of the town.
Police spokesman Besim Hoti said international officials were not targeted.

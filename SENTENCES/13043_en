BUCHAREST, Romania -- The next six months are crucial to Romania's EU entry bid, requiring intensified reform efforts, British Ambassador to Bucharest Quinton Quayle said on Friday (30 December). 
By June, the EU is expected to decide whether the accession date remains 1 January 2007 or will be postponed by one year. 
Quayle noted that the latest EC monitoring report on Romania contained a number of recommendations that must be taken seriously.
In other news, Austrian President Heinz Fischer said in an interview Thursday that Romania and Bulgaria would be joining the EU "soon", though he did not make clear whether he meant in 2007 or 2008. 
Austria is to take over the EU's rotating presidency in January.

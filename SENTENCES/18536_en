SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev is vowing to conduct a fast probe into the corruption scandal that has implicated high-ranking government and investigative officials. 
During a meeting with Parliament's anti-corruption committee on Tuesday (May 8th), he said the probe would last no more than a couple of weeks. 
The scandal has already resulted in the dismissal of two deputy ministers and the suspension of Deputy Prime Minister Rumen Ovcharov.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR) filed a vote of no confidence Wednesday (September 16th) against the cabinet. 
This was after Prime Minister Emil Boc presented three bills aimed at reforming the public sector. 
They cover a single wage system in the public sector, education reform and public administration reform. 
The PNL, which is unhappy that none of its amendments were included, was unable to start the procedure alone, so it negotiated help from the UDMR. 
Together they hold 121 out of 471 seats in parliament.
PNL president Crin Antonescu told reporters Wednesday that he is sure the vote of no confidence has no chance of passing. 
However, he added that this is a democratic procedure and they had the number of signatures required to start it. 
If the vote of no confidence fails, the three bills presented on Tuesday will be adopted and take effect as soon as the president signs them into law.

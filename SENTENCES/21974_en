BELGRADE, Serbia -- United Serbia leader Dragan Markovic said on Monday (June 16th) he is optimistic that the coalitions led by the Democratic Party (DS) and the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) will form a government, possibly within 15 days.
Official talks between the two sides are expected this week.
Local media reports suggest talks between the DS and the SPS have reached an advanced stage and that officials are already discussing the distribution of government posts.
Coalition talks began about a month ago, after no party won the majority needed to govern in the May 11th elections.

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih insisted on Sunday (May 27th) that Turkey and Iraq use diplomatic means to resolve the issue of terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) camps in northern Iraq. 
Salih met with a senior Turkish delegation to discuss the matter, particularly Turkey's threats to stage a cross-border operation against these PKK bases. 
Salih stressed that Iraq would not accept a breach of its sovereignty. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said a few days ago that Ankara's patience is wearing thin.
Also Sunday, Turkish security forces said they arrested two alleged PKK militants who were planning a terrorist attack on Turkey's third largest city, Izmir. 
Police found 10kg of plastic explosives, 15 hand grenades, two automatic rifles and two pistols in a house in Buca, a village near Izmir, where one of the men lived.

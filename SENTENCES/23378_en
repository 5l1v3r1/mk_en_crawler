PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) stopped short of calling for recognition of Kosovo's independence, but voiced their support for its development. 
In a resolution approved on Monday (May 25th), the ministers praised "the progress made towards strengthening democracy, by serving peace and stability in the country and the region". 
The document was initiated by Albania and tabled by Saudi Arabia.
Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha described the OIC resolution as a great success for Kosovo, and for Albanian diplomacy. 
In Pristina, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci attributed that success to the strength of Kosovo institutions and the support of Western countries.

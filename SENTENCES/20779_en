ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said Thursday (September 6th) evening that Greece will veto Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU if the longstanding name dispute between the two countries is not resolved.
Participating in a televised debate with the leaders of six main political parties ahead of the September 16th elections, Karamanlis said Greece has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to settle the issue, but insisted Macedonia has not responded appropriately.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government announced on Friday (January 15th) that it has established diplomatic relations with Kosovo through an exchange of letters between foreign ministers.
Montenegro recognised Kosovo's independence on October 9th 2008.
Last month, Serbia asked Podgorica to refrain from establishing diplomatic relations with Pristina until The Hague-based International Court of Justice decides on the validity of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia.

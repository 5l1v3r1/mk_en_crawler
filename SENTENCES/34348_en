ANKARA, Turkey -- The government plans to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq only if or when they are needed, Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said Saturday (25 October). 
He added that the government's only motivation is the welfare of the Iraqi people. 
Troops would therefore be sent only if an agreement is reached with Iraq's interim governing council.
On a related note, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday that talks with the United States on sending Turkish peacekeepers to Iraq are not over. 
The US administration has asked for some more time, possibly to persuade Iraqi interim authorities to agree to the deployment.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Ambassador Philip Reeker voiced hope on Thursday (October 7th) that Macedonia and Greece will soon find a solution to their long-standing name dispute.
He recalled that the message from the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest was clear -- Macedonia will be invited to join NATO once it has resolved the name row.
His comment came after Defence Minister Zoran Konjanovski suggested recently that the country should be admitted to the Alliance under the reference FYROM, if no solution to the dispute is found.

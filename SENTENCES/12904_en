ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government has sent a protest to Serbian authorities concerning the establishment in Belgrade of a Serb Croat parliament-in-exile.
Croatia said the parliament of the so-called "Republic of Serb-Krajina" casts a shadow over relations between the two countries.
Zagreb complained that the Serbian government had not adequately distanced itself from the action.
According to media reports, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party may be behind the Krajina initiative.
Some have also seen the move as an attempt to block Croatia's bid to join the EU.

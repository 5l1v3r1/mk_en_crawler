ATHENS, Greece -- British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said on Tuesday (May 26th) the two Cypriot communities need to speed up talks aimed at reunifying the divided island and achieve feasible progress in the next few months. 
Meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis in Athens, Miliband underscored the need for a solution to the Cyprus issue "by the Cypriots and for the Cypriots". 
He explained the UK is ready to play only a supportive role in the peace talks.
As far as Turkey's EU accession negotiations, Miliband said the UK supports the continuation of Ankara's preparations to join the EU. 
Bakoyannis stressed Turkey's EU bid is at a "turning point" and that it is up to Ankara to choose radical reforms that can bring it closer to Europe. 
"Greece would openly and clearly support this choice," she said. 
Bakoyannis again called on Turkey to implement the so-called Ankara Protocol, which expands the Turkish-EU customs union to include Cyprus. 
The protocol envisions free access of Greek Cypriot planes and ships to Turkish airports and ports. 
Ankara refuses to fully implement it until the EU fulfils its pledge to ease the isolation of Turkish Cypriots.

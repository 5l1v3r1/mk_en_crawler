ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament concluded on Wednesday (April 28th) the first reading of a package of constitutional amendments, approving all 30 articles. 
After a two-day break, lawmakers are expected to convene for the second reading late Saturday or Sunday, clearing the way for debate and voting next week. 
The ruling Justice and Development Party appears confident about getting the necessary 330 votes for each article, in both the first and second readings. 
Assuming that, the whole package will then be put to a public referendum. 
The main opposition Republican People's Party has made clear it intends to challenge the amendments before the Constitutional Court, if need be.

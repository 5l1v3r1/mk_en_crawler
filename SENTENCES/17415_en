SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A total of 16 Bulgarian firms have been certified to participate in NATO tenders, according to an announcement Monday (February 26th) by the State Commission for Information Security. 
Firm representatives met on Monday with military and trade attachÃ©s of the NATO and EU member states in Sofia, as well as with managers of Bulgarian defence industry companies.
In other news Monday, US Ambassador to Sofia John Beyrle rejected reports in some Western media that the US military plans actions against Iran via Bulgarian territory. 
He described the notion as absurd and stressed that there is room for diplomatic discussions over Iran's nuclear programme.

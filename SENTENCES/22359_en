NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are looking at establishing a telephone hotline for direct communication, Jose Luis Diaz, spokesman of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, said on Tuesday (July 15th). 
The hotline would aim to facilitate the two leaders' renewed efforts to reunify the island, Diaz added. 
This would be the first direct communication link between the two communities' leaders in more than three decades. 
Currently, telephone calls from the Greek part of Cyprus to the Turkish side must go through Turkey.

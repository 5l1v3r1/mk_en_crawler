SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government has announced pending shuffles in the special services' leadership.
Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov issued a statement Saturday (26 June) saying General Valentin Petrov will be appointed the new director of the National Service for Fight against Organised Crime.
He replaces General Roumen Milanov, who is retiring.
Petkanov says General Dimitar Vladimirov has resigned as head of the National Guard Service (NGO), amid reports linking several NGO officers to local criminal structures.
In other news, the government extradited Nenad Milenkovic, a reputed member of the Zemun clan, to Serbia last week.
He was arrested in Sofia on 11 June.
On Friday, a Belgrade court convicted 13 alleged members of the Zemun clan of drug trafficking and other crimes.
They were arrested during the sweeps that followed Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination last year.

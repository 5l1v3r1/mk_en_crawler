BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania were due to start talks Wednesday (5 July) on joining the European Economic Area, a free trade area including EU member states and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. 
Negotiations are expected to focus on issues related to farming, environment, statistics and companies.
Meanwhile, a new report by the Standard & Poor's rating agency suggests that Bulgaria and Romania, which face the risk of delayed EU entry because of accession reform problems, might end up beating EU member Hungary in joining the euro zone. 
Bulgaria and Romania have a stronger financial track than Hungary, the report says.

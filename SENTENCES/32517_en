SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson has called on the top war crimes indictees, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, to surrender, warning that the circle around them was tightening. 
In an interview published Wednesday (12 March) in the Sarajevo daily <I>Dnevni avaz</I>, Robertson declared that "there was no place in the world that can hide those indicted by The Hague tribunal for horrible crimes." On Tuesday, SFOR spokesman Dale MacEachern said recent raids on civil and military facilities in Republika Srpska resulted in collecting "significant information".

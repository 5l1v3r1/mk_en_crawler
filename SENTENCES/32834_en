SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Monday (3 February), the Macedonian government adopted a concrete action plan for the implementation of commitments taken under the Ohrid peace accord Monday.
The plan includes three segments:
the operation plan, procedures for decentralisation of power, and a programme for equal representation of all ethnic communities in pubic administration.
The document also sets a timetable for the adoption of some 90 bills.
The cabinet is likely to deal with the one of the most important of them, the law on passports, this month or next.(Utrinski Vesnik - 04/03/02;

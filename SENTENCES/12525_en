ANKARA, Turkey -- Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane and Olli Rehn, the EU's commissioner for enlargement, issued a joint statement Monday (7 March) condemning the use of excessive force by the Turkish police Sunday in dispersing a demonstration marking International Women's Day. 
"On the eve of a visit by the EU during which the rights of women will be an important issue, we are concerned to see such disproportionate force used against demonstrators," the three officials said. 
They were in Ankara for talks with Turkish leaders on the country's EU membership bid. 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul expressed regret over the incident and promised an investigation. 
Luxembourg currently holds the rotating EU presidency and will pass it on to Britain in June.

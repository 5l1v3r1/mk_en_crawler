THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Portugal signed an agreement Wednesday (December 19th) that allows those convicted by the UN war crimes tribunal to serve their sentences in Portuguese prisons.
The prison term cannot however exceed the maximum sentence for any crime committed under Portuguese law.
If parliament approves the document, Portugal would become the 13th country to sign such an agreement with The Hague tribunal.

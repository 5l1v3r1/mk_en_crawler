SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties have collected the 50 signatures required to appeal controversial amendments to the local elections act to the Constitutional Court, Stefan Sofiyanski, leader of Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, said on Thursday (August 2nd). 
At issue is the procedure used to pass several texts in the days before lawmakers went on summer recess. 
As a result, the predominantly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms managed to include a clause which would allow its supporters living in Turkey to cast votes, even if they haven't resided for at least ten months in local municipalities. 
Though he has criticised the measure, President Georgi Parvanov has scheduled local elections for October 28th.
In other news Thursday, the Bulgarian government announced it is writing off $56.6m in debt that Libya accumulated during the 1980s. 
The move will represent Bulgaria's contribution to the fund used to finance treatment for more than 400 children, infected with HIV at a Benghazi hospital. 
The move was a key factor behind Libya's decision to commute the death sentences of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, allowing their transfer to Bulgaria last month.

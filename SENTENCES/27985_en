ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Thursday (October 21st) that post EU accession, Croatia expects to have 12 representatives in the European Parliament (EP), one commissioner and one judge in the European Court. 
She added that next month, Zagreb expects to wrap up talks on the 34th chapter of its EU membership talks, which regulates Croatia's participation in the EU bodies. 
With accession, she noted, Croatian will become an official language of the bloc. 
The country hopes to complete its accession talks in the first half of 2011 and join the bloc in 2012.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's top defence panel, the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM), met on Friday (March 30th) to discuss $4 billion in procurements for modernising the defence sector. 
The SSM awarded $2.7 billion for the supply of combat helicopters to Italy's Agusta Westland, owned by Finmeccanica SpA.
Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul explained that the project involves an initial purchase of 50 ATAK helicopters, produced in Turkey. 
"The main contractor will be Turkish Aerospace Industries and the Italians will be the subcontractors. 
This means the helicopters will be produced in Turkey and will be called the T-129," Gonul said.

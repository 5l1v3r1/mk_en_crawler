ANKARA, Turkey -- French President Jacques Chirac expressed regret for the French Assembly's approval of a bill that makes it a crime to deny that genocide was committed against Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. "Chirac called me and told me he was sorry and he said that he is listening to our statements and he thinks we are right and he will do what he can in the upcoming process," Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said at a gathering of the ruling Justice and Development Party late on Saturday (October 14th).
To become law, the bill will have to be approved by the Senate.
Turkish politicians have warned that adoption of this legislation could deal a blow to bilateral relations.
In other news, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barosso said in an interview published on Monday that it may take Turkey another 15 to 20 years to join the EU.
He said reforms have been slowing down.

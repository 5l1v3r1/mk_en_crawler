BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Monday (April 11th) that Turkey is ready to host a political office for Taliban militants from Afghanistan in an effort to facilitate talks that would bring peace to that region.
He discussed the idea last month in Ankara with Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghani president, who leads a peace council set up by the Afghan government to work towards a political solution.
Arsala Rahmani, a member of that council, said Ankara is already planning to establish the office, but warned that implementation will take time.
Davutoglu was speaking in Budapest, where he met with Hungarian counterpart Janos Martony and President Pal Schmitt.
Discussions focused on bilateral relations and on Turkey's EU agenda.
Hungary is the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency.

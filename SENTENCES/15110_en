SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Health Minister Radoslav Gaidarski said on Wednesday (30 November) that Bulgaria would overhaul its healthcare system prior to EU accession in 2007.
The government, he explained, is determined to eliminate waste, slash debt in the sector and privatise the worst performing state-owned healthcare providers.
Hospitals have amassed debts of $120m in the last few years due to poor management and insufficient oversight.
In other news Wednesday, it was confirmed that Dimitar Tolev has resigned as deputy director of the customs agency.
Though he cited personal reasons, media reports suggested the decision was related to corruption investigations within the agency.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal unsealed the indictments Monday (12 September) against two Croatian journalists charged with revealing the identity of protected witnesses in tribunal trials. 
The two -- former editor-in-chief of the Slobodna Dalmacija newspaper Josip Jovic and Hrvatsko Slovo editor-in-chief Marijan Krizic -- are charged with one count of contempt, stemming from the case of General Tihomir Blaskic in November 1997. 
UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has repeatedly criticised Croatian authorities for leaking classified information to the media.

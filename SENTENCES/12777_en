SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Minister for Local Self-Government Rizvan Sulejmani announced on Wednesday (5 January) that the real start of the country's decentralisation process would begin on 1 July.
Sulejmani said implementation would be very difficult, but stressed that it was the only way to bring Macedonia closer to Euro-Atlantic structures.

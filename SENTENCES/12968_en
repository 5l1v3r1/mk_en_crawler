LONDON, United Kingdom -- Britain is strongly committed to making it possible for Turkey to join the EU, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told parliament on Thursday (30 June). 
He was briefing lawmakers on government plans for Britain's six-month presidency of the Union, which began Friday (1 July).
In other news Thursday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the BBC that Turkey must make European values part of everyday life if it wants to join the EU. 
He warned that this could be a long process that would not end automatically with accession.
Also Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan paid an official visit to Baku, Azerbaijan. 
In meetings with President Ilham Aliyev, Prime Minister Artur Rasizade and others, he stressed the need for strengthened trade, citing projects such as the new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The agriculture ministry on Sunday (April 26th) banned the import of pork and live swine from all countries because of the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico and elsewhere.
The head of the Veterinary Department at the ministry, Zoran Micovic, attributed the decision to recommendations by the World Health Organisation.
The new strain of the swine flu first appeared in Mexico, where it has claimed more than 100 lives.
Specialists believe around 1,600 people are ill with it there.
In other news, Serbia's government has formed a special commission to try to locate the grave of a World War II guerrilla leader executed as a traitor by the communists.
The location of Dragoljub Draza Mihailovic's grave has been a mystery since postwar communist authorities executed him in 1946, claiming he had collaborated with the Nazis.
A Chicago-based Serb group recently offered a 75,500-euro reward for help finding the grave.
Mihailovic, a Yugoslav soldier, launched a resistance movement in 1941 to fight German occupiers.
He also fought against communist guerrillas later in the war.

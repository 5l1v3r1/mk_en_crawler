BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Portugal, which takes over rotating EU presidency within weeks, would continue to work on behalf of Turkey's EU integration, Portuguese Foreign Minister Luis Amado said on Tuesday (May 15th). 
Citing the priorities of the Portuguese presidency, Amado said his country would try to strengthen co-operation between the EU, Africa and the Mediterranean. 
He said he is aware there would be opposition, especially with regard to Turkey, but added, "I am in favour of enlargement to Turkey â¦ we have a commitment and it will be difficult not to fulfil such a commitment." Amado said another major challenge would be the expected solution of Kosovo's final status.

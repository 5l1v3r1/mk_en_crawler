LUXEMBOURG -- Serbia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague has improved somewhat over the past year, but remains insufficient, Hague chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said in a report submitted to the EU foreign ministers. 
Addressing the EU Council in Luxembourg on Monday (October 15th), del Ponte stressed that Serbia must arrest former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic to prove it is meeting its obligations to the tribunal.
In light of her assessment, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn announced that the foreign ministers would like to postpone their decision on initialling the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia until the end of October. 
Rehn said the issue would be reviewed again after del Ponte's next visit to Belgrade, on October 25th. 
Serbia is now offering a 1m-euro reward for Mladic's arrest.

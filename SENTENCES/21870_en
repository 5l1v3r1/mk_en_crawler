PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The United States and the EU signed an agreement Wednesday (October 22nd) on US participation in the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo.
About 80 US police officers, judges and prosecutors will be deployed in Kosovo, the first time US staff are taking part in an EU mission.
"The EU and the US have a common wish to work together in supporting the development of democratic standards in Kosovo, especially in strengthening the independent and multi-ethnic system of the rule of law," US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried said after signing the accord.
The EU Council of Ministers approved US participation in EULEX last week.
The mission will also include officials from several non-EU countries such as Turkey, Switzerland, Croatia and Norway.

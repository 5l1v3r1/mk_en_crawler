ANKARA, Turkey -- More than 250 people were injured and three died during a second day of rioting in southeastern Turkey on Wednesday (29 March). 
The violence started when several hundred Kurdish protesters took to the streets of Diyarbakir, damaging shops and offices and setting cars on fire. 
About 30 people were admitted to hospital, one in serious condition. 
The riots broke out following the burial of four members of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
They were among 14 killed in an army operation last weekend. 
Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir has called for restraint, as have parties in parliament.

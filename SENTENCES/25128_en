THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will proceed as scheduled on March 1st, Presiding Judge O-Gon Kwon said on Saturday (January 30th). 
On Thursday, Karadzic said that although he is ready to make an opening statement then, he needs more time, reportedly over to payments to his legal advisers. 
According to Kwon, if Karadzic wants to seek a postponement, he must submit a written request as soon as possible. 
Karadzic's trial began in October, but was suspended almost immediately due to his refusal to attend the sessions.

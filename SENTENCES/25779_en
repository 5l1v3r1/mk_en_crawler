PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia is supplying northern Kosovo, including the northern part of divided town of Mitrovica, with electricity after the Kosovo Electric Corporation (KEK) disconnected the region from its grid Monday (October 19th).
Serbian officials said they intervened to avoid a humanitarian crisis, adding this is a temporary solution provided from the Novi Pazar power line.
KEK disconnected the Serb-dominated region from its network citing the risk of overload.
The company had previously warned that it would cut service due to non-payment of bills.
The government said Tuesday that Serbia's interference is a result of the lack of rule of law in northern Kosovo.

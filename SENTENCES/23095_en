NEW YORK, United States -- International troops in Kosovo should not have used force to storm a courthouse in Mitrovica in March, according to a UN internal investigation report, quoted by the media Saturday (August 2nd).
On March 17th, KFOR and UNMIK troops raided the court building to arrest Serb judicial workers staging a protest inside.
The raid triggered riots by local Serbs.
Clashes between them and international troops killed one UNMIK policeman and injured 200 people.
According to Reuters, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Edmond Mulet presented the internal report at a closed briefing.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said he was satisfied with the findings, which he says resulted from Belgrade's "persistent pressure".

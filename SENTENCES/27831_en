SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Parliament (EP) on Thursday (May 20th) approved allocating an additional 300m-euros in compensation to Bulgaria by 2013, for dismantling the four oldest units at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, local media reported. 
The decision was a formality, but it clears the way for the release of the first tranche, 75m euros, this year. 
The government plans to use 40% -- 120m euros -- of the compensation to invest in energy efficiency-promoting projects, and the rest to dismantle the four units.

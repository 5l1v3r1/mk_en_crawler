BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers decided on Monday (December 7th) to establish a working group this month to draft Croatia's Accession Treaty. 
The ministers also approved a financial package for Croatia that was proposed by the European Commission. 
The package, based on the assumption that Croatia will join the EU in 2012, envisions appropriations worth 3.5 billion euros in 2012 and 2013. 
The country is expected to contribute 1.2 billion euros to the EU budget during the first two years of membership.

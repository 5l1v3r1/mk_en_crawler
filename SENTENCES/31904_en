BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- EU security chief Javier Solana announced Thursday (28 November) that the leaders of Serbia and Montenegro have agreed on the constitutional charter of their new union. 
He said "total consensus" had been reached, following a meeting with Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and Montenegrin Prime Minister-designate Milo Djukanovic. 
The constitutional charter, which had been the final stumbling block to forming the new federation, is to be signed on Tuesday. 
Kostunica described the breakthrough as "one of those compromises in which everyone gains something and no one gains everything." He expressed the hope that adoption of the new charter would lead to eventual admission in the Council of Europe and to the start of accession talks with the EU.

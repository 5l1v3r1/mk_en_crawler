BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's ruling Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) rejected a Serb Democratic Party (SDS) proposal to form a coalition in the Federation of BiH for the October general elections. 
Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic, who leads SDS, had suggested the idea, arguing that RS parties stand a better chance if they join forces in the other entity. 
In response, SNSD deputy leader Velimir Kunic said that SDS had neglected the Serb people in FBiH and the problems of Serb returnees there for years. 
Other parties in RS have not commented on Cavic's proposal.

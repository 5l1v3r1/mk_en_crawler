SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski received a letter from US President George W. Bush, congratulating him on the election of the new government and voicing support for its reform programme.
Bush stressed that Washington is ready to collaborate with Gruevski's government to reach the common vision of a stable and prosperous Macedonia, integrated in the Euro-Atlantic structures.
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, which headed the former government, announced plans to hold a party congress next month, to examine the reasons for its defeat and to consider the future of top leaders.
Some in the party blame former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
In other news, the US embassy in Skopje donated video teleconferencing equipment Friday (1 September) to the public prosecutor's office.
The equipment will boost the law enforcement agencies' abilities to tackle organised crime and human trafficking cases by enabling witnesses to testify by long distance.

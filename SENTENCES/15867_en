HELSINKI, Finland -- At a meeting in Helsinki on Thursday (October 19th), the European People's Party (EPP) voiced support for Croatia's accession to NATO in 2008. 
The leaders of Europe's conservative parties said they will push for the country's admission into the alliance at the NATO summit in Riga next month.
Also on Thursday, the prime ministers of Croatia and Slovenia, Ivo Sanader and Janez Jansa, rejected speculations that Slovenia is blocking the start of Croatia's EU accession negotiations on the fisheries chapter of the acquis. 
Jansa said that although some open bilateral border issues exist, Slovenia is among the EU members that most strongly support Croatia's EU integration course. 
The officials were in Finland to attend the EPP summit.

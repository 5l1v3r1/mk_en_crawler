PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UN mission chief Michael Steiner said in a televised speech Monday (20 January) that it would not be possible to start talks this year on the future of the province. 
He reiterated the international community's stance, which is that negotiations could begin only when Kosovo becomes politically and economically stable. 
Addressing calls from local politicians for greater independence, Steiner said local institutions must first "work more seriously" in handling current responsibilities.

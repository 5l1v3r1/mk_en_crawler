ATHENS, Greece -- Restructuring Greece's debt would be disastrous to the country's economy, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said in an interview with the weekly Proto Thema, published on Sunday (June 20th).
"We fought to avoid the danger of a default and debt restructuring, and we made it, thanks to the EU-IMF support mechanism," Papaconstantinou added.
He also ruled out abolishing the euro in the country.
Papaconstantinou's statement followed his Russian counterpart Alexei Kudrin's speech at an economic forum in St Petersburg in which he said that he expects a restructuring of the Greek debt.

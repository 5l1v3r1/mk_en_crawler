BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Serbs may finally take part in the decentralisation process in the province, according to statements issued in Belgrade and Pristina on Tuesday (12 April). 
Former Kosovo Agriculture Minister Goran Bogdanovic says members of the Serb Ticket for Kosovo and Metohija have decided to join the decentralisation task force run by UNMIK. 
He said Serb representatives are no longer willing to take a passive role in the process. 
Separately, following the international Kosovo Contact Group's visit to Belgrade earlier this week, German member Michael Schaeffer said the Serb administration would encourage and back Kosovo Serb participation in working groups in the province. 
He noted signs of increased chances for compromise.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Leaders of two main political parties and government coalition partners -- President Fatmir Sejdiu of the Democratic League of Kosovo and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of the Democratic Party of Kosovo -- agreed on Thursday (October 22nd) that the November 15th municipal elections will not harm their partnership. 
During a visit to the Central Elections Commission (CEC), Sejdiu said the coalition serves stability. 
Thaci added that "nothing can shake the state-forming partnership." Both agreed that the election process is a big test, following last year's independence declaration.
Meanwhile, US Ambassador to Pristina Christopher Dell warned Kosovo institutions and political parties on Thursday against involving the CEC in their campaigns. 
"I ask the president and political parties ... 
to give the CEC space, time, and dignity to do its job with responsibility," Dell said.

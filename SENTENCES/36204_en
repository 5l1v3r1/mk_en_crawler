ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul says a few constitutional changes necessary to EU membership must be adopted soon.
Speaking Sunday (7 March), he said reforms implemented so far are a significant achievement, as both foreign and local officials have noted.
He added only a few more steps are needed to meet fully the Copenhagen political criteria for Union membership.
Gul said the remaining reforms must be completed by mid-year.
In other news, an estimated 80,000 civil servants gathered in Ankara on Saturday to protest a draft law that could result in thousands of layoffs.
The new law would allow local governments to make appointments in their areas, as opposed to a central body in Ankara.
Meanwhile, 15 people were reported dead in avalanches and flooding in central and eastern Turkey, including a British vacationer who was skiing.

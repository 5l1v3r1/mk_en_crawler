PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the International Civilian Office (ICO) in Kosovo, Pieter Feith, reiterated on Sunday (June 1st) that once Kosovo's constitution enters into force on June 15th, the government will receive further responsibilities, as spelled out in former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari's plan. 
Feith visited Gjakova on Sunday as part of the "Come to Europe" campaign that invites the public to embrace the idea of Kosovo's future in the EU. 
"Don't forget the destruction you've witnessed after the conflict. 
Achievements in developing Gjakova are visible, and together we will be part of the new family that is the EU," Feith said.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senior government partner Democratic Party (PD) will run alone in the May 13th elections for European Parliament (EP) members. 
PD leader Emil Boc told reporters Monday (January 29th) that the decision did not signal the breakup of Romania's ruling alliance with the National Liberal Party, since there is no provision regarding the EP elections.
However, Prime Minister and PNL leader Calin Popescu Tariceanu reacted strongly to the news. 
He described the PD decision as shocking and said it undermined the alliance.

CHISINAU, Moldova -- The government has officially complained to the Council of Europe (CoE) about Romania's recent refusal to sign an agreement confirming Moldova's borders.
It also requested CoE assistance in settling the dispute.
Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase publicly refused to sign the agreement during the session of the CoE Parliamentary Assembly earlier this month, saying that Romania recognised Moldova's independence in 1991 and there was no need to sign other documents.

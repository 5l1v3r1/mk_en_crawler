PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prosecutors have pressed fresh money laundering charges against Dusko Saric, brother of fugitive drug lord Darko Saric, local media reported on Saturday (May 14th).
Dusko Saric and Jovica Loncar, who was arrested several days ago, allegedly have laundered more than 2m euros made in cocaine trafficking.
Dusko Saric also faces charges of establishing a criminal organisation and drug trafficking.
He was arrested last November in Montenegro based on an arrest warrant issued by Italy for drug trafficking.

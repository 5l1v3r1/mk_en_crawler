ZAGREB, Croatia -- The defence ministry responded on Tuesday (October 2nd) to a report Monday by Jutarnji List that described Croatian soldiers in Afghanistan as "exhausted".
A statement on the ministry's website insisted the troops are performing tasks "in a responsible and professional manner", impossible to do if tired.

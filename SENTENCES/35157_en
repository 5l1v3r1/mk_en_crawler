SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Tuesday (27 April) urged the international coalition to provide substantial reinforcements to Bulgaria's 480 troops in the Iraqi town of Karbala, and suggested the troops be relocated to a nearby Polish base since their current location has come under repeated attack. 
Parvanov, who visited the Bulgarian battalion on Saturday, also called on the UN and NATO to play a greater role in Iraq. 
During his trip to Iraq, Parvanov reaffirmed Bulgaria's commitment to the US-led coalition.

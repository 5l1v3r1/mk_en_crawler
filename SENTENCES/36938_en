BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania assumed the presidency of the UN Security Council Thursday (1 July) for one month, in accordance with an alphabetical rotation principle.
According to Bucharest, the first item on the agenda is a debate on co-operation between the UN and regional organisations in furthering the stabilisation and conflict prevention process.
In other news, the ruling Social Democratic Party has asked members who lost in recent local elections to resign from the party by Saturday.
This is in an apparent effort to cultivate stronger candidates before the general elections in November.

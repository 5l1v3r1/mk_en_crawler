OXFORD, United Kingdom -- The latest developments in relations between the two communities in Cyprus will contribute to the successful resolution of their disputes, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Wednesday (7 May) at Oxford University.
He was referring to the recent easing of restrictions on crossing the border between the Greek and Turkish parts of the island.
These developments, Papandreou added, created an atmosphere of trust, respect and solidarity that had been lacking.

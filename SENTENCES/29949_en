PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday (May 20th) that the bloc is committed to the European perspective of Kosovo. 
Pristina should step up reforms, including fight against organised crime and corruption, he said after talks with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci in Pristina. 
He also assessed as positive development the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia and called for constructive approach in the talks. 
Thaci in his turn voiced hope that the EC's next progress report on Kosovo will be more positive that the last year's.

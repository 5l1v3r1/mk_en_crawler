ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Thursday (October 18th) that Turkey still hopes to find a diplomatic solution to the presence of terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases in northern Iraq.
Visiting Cairo, Babacan stressed that while Ankara wants to give diplomacy a chance, it is determined to end deadly PKK strikes on targets in Turkey.
Thousands of Kurds and their supporters took to the streets of large northern Iraqi cities on Thursday to protest Turkey's decision to launch a cross-border operation against the PKK camps.
An estimated 10,000 demonstrators rallied in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish regional government, while another 5,000 gathered in Duhuk.
The Kurdistan regional government said on Thursday that it had invited Turkish officials for talks to defuse the crisis.
The government in Baghdad is asking PKK guerrillas to leave the country.
In other news Thursday, police in Izmir arrested seven PKK members suspected of involvement in an October 2nd attack in the town.
One person was killed and 11 others were injured after two bombs exploded in Izmir's Buca district.
Police said the group was preparing new bombings that would have been three times more powerful.

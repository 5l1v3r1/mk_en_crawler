ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb regional court rejected an appeal Wednesday (5 July) by former parliament member Branimir Glavas, ruling that a probe into allegations of war crimes should continue. 
Glavas, a former Croatian Democratic Union official who later became an independent, is accused of crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. 
He lost his parliamentary immunity in May. 
Glavas tried to argue that the probe is groundless, but magistrates rejected the appeal.

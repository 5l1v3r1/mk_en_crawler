ZAGREB, Croatia -- Another fireman critically injured in the wildfire on the island of Kornati late last month died early on Sunday (September 16th), bringing the total number of victims to 12. 
Ante Juricev Mikulin was 22. 
Meanwhile, relatives of the victims announced on Friday their decision to react to "inappropriate" statements by some state officials regarding the Kornati tragedy. 
They insist on getting more information about the actual events on the island on August 30th and criticised Croatian Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic, who refused to talk about the incident Friday.

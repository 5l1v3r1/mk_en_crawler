ATHENS, Greece -- Speaking to reporters after a meeting with US President George W. Bush in Washington Friday (20 May), Greece's Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said the two leaders had a "very friendly and constructive" conversation.
Karamanlis said he reiterated his country's position on the name issue with Skopje.
In other news, the Greek government said Saturday it would suspend a law that restricts media-owning companies from receiving public contracts.
The legislation, part of the government's anticorruption platform, provoked protests from the EU -- saying that it violates the Union's competition rules.

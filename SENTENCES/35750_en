COMPTON, United States -- Dimosthenis Giannissopoulos, the security chief for Athens's subway system, attended a major anti-terrorist exercise in California on Friday (30 January) as part of his country's preparations for the upcoming Summer Olympics.
About 500 security officers took part in the drill, which involved terrorists using poison gas in a theatre and then trying to escape by car and a hijacked train.
In other news, a new poll by Greek company MRB, published Sunday, suggests Greece's main opposition party, New Democracy, is 3.7 per cent ahead of the ruling PASOK party.
Elections are scheduled for 7 March.

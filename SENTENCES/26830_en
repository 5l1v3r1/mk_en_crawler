ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (March 9th) that Turkey will not send its ambassador back to Washington until it gets a clear signal on the future of the so-called "Armenian genocide" bill. 
Ankara recalled Ambassador Namik Tan for immediate consultation after the US House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the bill on March 4th. 
"The US should not lose a strategic partner as Turkey because of such an issue," Erdogan told reporters in Riyadh, where he is visiting.

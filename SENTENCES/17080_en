SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The High Judicial Council decided on Wednesday (November 1st) to lift the immunity of two more regional prosecutors, Karen Beylerian and Toni Tomov from Varna, who are accused of attempting to influence criminal investigations. 
Last month, Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev requested their immunity be lifted.
Also Wednesday, Velchev announced the launch of a pilot project introducing the investigative prosecutorial post, required under the new penal code. 
During this trial period, five prosecutors from Sofia will work closely with investigators handling cases of high public interest. 
Bulgaria is seeking to emulate anti-mafia prosecutorial structures in Italy and Romania.

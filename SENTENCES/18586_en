BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albania must hold free and democratic elections if it wants to join the Alliance next year, a NATO spokesman said on Thursday (January 11th).
"NATO certainly sees the electoral process in the larger sense as a critical test for membership in the Alliance," James Appathurai said.
NATO is expected to invite Albania, Croatia and Macedonia to become members in 2008, but the spokesman warned that these countries have to meet the relevant conditions and said there are "no guarantees".
Albania's opposition Socialists and the ruling Democrats are currently locked in a dispute over a new election law.
The quarrel has prevented the local elections from being held on January 20th as planned.

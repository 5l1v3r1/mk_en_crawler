WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF announced on Friday (February 19th) it would give Romania $3.32 billion as part of a big loan to help the country recover from its deep recession. 
The IMF, the World Bank and the EU drafted a $27.2 billion aid package last May. 
The latest tranche, which will be disbursed "immediately", will bring the total amount received by Bucharest so far to $12.6 billion, the IMF said in a statement from its headquarters in Washington. 
The decision to allocate the money followed a review of Romania's economic performance under the programme.
In other news, Romanian police seized 100kg of heroin Saturday in a Bulgarian truck that was transporting aid to Haiti. 
The drugs, hidden in the truck travelling to Belgium, were found at the border with Hungary. 
An investigation is under way. 
The driver, a Bulgarian national, has been arrested.

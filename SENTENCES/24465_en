SOFIA, Bulgaria/SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)/BELGRADE, Serbia -- A row between Russia and Ukraine over unpaid gas bills continued to harm everyday life and industries across the Balkans on Friday (January 9th). 
All Russian gas deliveries via Ukraine ceased on Tuesday after Moscow accused Kiev of siphoning Europe-bound gas from pipelines that cross Ukraine.
In Bulgaria, a total of 64 elementary and high schools remained without heat. 
Thousands of households and 72 industrial enterprises were also affected. 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said to Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov on Saturday that his country was ready to supply Bulgaria with 1.5 to 2m cubic m of natural gas daily from its own reserves.
BiH's presidency said it will declare a state of emergency on January 12th if gas delivery does not resume. 
About 72,500 households have lost heat, and some factories had to halt production. 
On Friday, the country started to import gas from Serbia, BH-Gas said. 
Hungary said Saturday it will also supply BiH and Croatia with natural gas.
Serbia said Friday its gas supply was returning to normal after Germany and Hungary started delivering 5m cubic m of natural gas daily. 
Local media reported heat had resumed in all towns.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) remains fully committed to Turkey's EU accession negotiations, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday (March 26th) at a joint press conference with Turkish President Abdullah Gul in Brussels.
Barroso said the EU has a long-term strategic interest in its relations with Turkey, noting it is important that the country continue its political and technical reforms aimed at bringing it closer to EU accession.
He also urged Ankara to refrain from restricting media freedom and independence.
Gul, in turn, said his talks with Barroso were open and friendly, adding he hoped his visit to EC headquarters, the first by a Turkish president, will bring new impetus to the accession process.

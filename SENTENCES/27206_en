SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian authorities have failed to provide justice for thousands of women raped during the 1992-1995 conflict, Amnesty International said in a report published Wednesday (September 30th). 
The human rights organisation voiced its concern about the small number of investigations and trials involving sexually violent crimes. 
"It is a shame that the authorities have been neglecting the needs of the survivors for the last 14 years," Amnesty International official Marek Marczynski told a press conference in Sarajevo. 
He added victims have no access to adequate health care or psychological support. 
An estimated 20,000 and 50,000 rapes occurred during that timeframe. 
Amnesty International says only 18 such cases been prosecuted by The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
Bosnian courts have convicted only 12 people.

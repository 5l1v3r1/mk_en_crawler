NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN envoy to Cyprus Alexander Downer rejected media speculation Monday (March 15th) about an upcoming international conference on Cyprus.
According to the reports, the meeting would discuss the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, which regulates the status of independent Cyprus and made Britain, Greece and Turkey guarantors of the independence, territorial integrity and security of the island.
Representatives of both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island reportedly also planned to attend.
Downer said he never issued such invitations and stressed that the security and guarantees issue will be settled in direct talks between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat will hold another of their direct, ongoing talks on Tuesday.

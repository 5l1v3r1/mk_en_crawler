SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Monday (10 March), the Macedonian government debated the country's position on a possible war in Iraq but reached no consensus. 
Late last week, the United States formally requested Macedonia's support in a possible attack. 
The <I>Dnevnik</I> daily says it would be in the form of small-scale logistics support, to be deployed in Turkey.
Also Monday, Bulgaria's rightist opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) called for a unified state position on Iraq. 
The party asked President Georgi Parvanov to summon the National Security Advisory Council to discuss the issue. 
The request followed a call by the left-wing opposition Socialist Party for Foreign Minister Solomon Passy to resign over alleged discrepancies between his position and that of the state.

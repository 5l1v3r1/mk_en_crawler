BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The broadcast of a tape showing the 1995 execution of six young Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica "will mark a turning point in the minds of our public and make it easier for the government to fulfill its commitments to The [Hague] tribunal," a Serbian minister said Saturday (4 June).
Rasim Ljajic, who is in charge of human rights and co-operation with the tribunal, appeared to be signaling that the authorities were now prepared to arrest top war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic.
Police in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have already made several arrests in connection with the murders, and authorities are looking for more suspects on the tape.
Visiting Sarajevo on Friday, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said she wants Mladic and Karadzic in The Hague before 11 July, the day ceremonies will be held to mark the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.
She said their extradition would be the only "decent way to pay tribute" to the Srebrenica victims and their families.

ANKARA, Turkey -- European Commission President Romano Prodi on Thursday (15 January) urged the Turkish government to boost implementation of already-adopted democratic reforms and to help reunite divided Cyprus. 
Prodi added that Ankara is closer than ever to the EU, but still needs to persuade sceptics in Europe that it deserves to join the Union. 
In an address to parliament, he called on Turkey to use its influence on Turkish Cypriots in efforts to resolve the issue of Cyprus before 1 May. 
That's when the Greek part of the island is to be admitted to the EU. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan assured Prodi that his government is determined to meet the Union's criteria for democracy and "do its best, to expend all efforts to speedily reach a just and durable settlement (in Cyprus) before May". 
Turkish stocks rebounded Thursday after a steep decline on news of Prodi's arrival in Ankara. 
Accompanied by EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen, Prodi became the first commission president to visit Turkey since the signing of the Ankara Agreement in 1963.

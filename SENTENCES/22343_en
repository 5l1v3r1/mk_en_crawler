BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities have launched a probe of safety conditions at Romanian mines following Saturday's (November 15th) gas explosions in the Petrila coal mine in the southwest that killed 12 people and injured 13 others.
According to media reports Sunday, the inquiry will determine if all protective measures were in place before the deadly blasts, said Finance and Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian.
Authorities suspended mine managers to "allow an objective and transparent investigation", he said.
The first methane gas explosion killed eight miners.
A second blast killed four rescue personnel who went down the shaft to help.

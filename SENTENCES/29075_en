ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor on Sunday (June 6th) called on labour unions to return to participate in negotiations on amendments to labour-related laws.
She insisted that the proposed changes would strengthen -- not abolish -- collective bargaining, giving unions the chance to negotiate new terms.
In addition, she stressed that the economic recession necessitated a change in these agreements.
Under the proposal, all parties would have six months to conclude new collective agreements after the current ones expire, instead of automatic renewals.
After this deadline, workers' rights are to be cancelled and are to be separately agreed with employers.
Ozren Matijasevic, chairman of the trade unions association, called Kosor's invitation for talks "a positive reaction" on the part of the government and added that his association will attend a meeting scheduled for Tuesday.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Tuesday (29 October), the BiH central government ordered an indefinite suspension of all arms exports, following revelations of illegal shipments of aircraft spare parts to Iraq.
Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Azra Hadziahmetovic said the ban would remain in place until authorities develop an adequate system for licensing arms deals.
The controversy has already cost the jobs of Republika Srpska's defence minister and its army and air force chiefs of staff.
Senior defence officials in Yugoslavia have also stepped down.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown will brief NATO and EU officials on the scandal Wednesday in Brussels.

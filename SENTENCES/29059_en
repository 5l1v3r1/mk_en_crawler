PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament adopted a bill Tuesday (September 7th) on the status and rights of war veterans, martyrs, invalids, civilian victims and their families. 
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said the legislation will provide state support to all war-related categories; beneficiaries will get health and education services, and will be exempted from taxes, customs and fees. 
The effort is expected to cost the state budget about 16m euros annually, starting in January 2011.

TIRANA, Albania -- Mustafa Kercuku, the head of the High State Audit, criticised public administrators Thursday (5 August) for misusing public funds.
The misuse has resulted in damages totalling 370m euros over the past seven years, Kercuku said.
At the same time, he expressed satisfaction with the level of co-operation between the High State Audit and prosecutors, saying he hopes to further bolster it.

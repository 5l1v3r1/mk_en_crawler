SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) may discuss in either January or March possible sanctions against BiH for ignoring a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, Council of Europe representative Caroline Ravaud warned on Sunday (November 7th) at a conference in Sarajevo.
The European Court in Strasbourg ruled in December that BiH's constitution, created as an annex to the Dayton Peace Agreements, discriminates against minorities.
The Court urged BiH to reform the constitution and guarantee equal representation for all.
Ravaud warned against any further delays in implementing the ruling, and said any such failure could hamper Sarajevo's EU integration process.

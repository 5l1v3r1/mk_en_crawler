BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The chair of the Serbia-Montenegro National Council for Co-operation with International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Rasim Ljajic, said Monday (9 August) that failure to clarify relations with the tribunal would be costly.
Extradition of wartime Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic remains "the condition of conditions", Ljajic said, warning that lack of full co-operation with the ICTY could jeopardise Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration process.

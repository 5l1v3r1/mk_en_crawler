MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragan Covic will remain the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union BiH (HDZ BiH) despite his jail sentence, party spokesman Miso Relota said on Saturday (November 18th). 
On Friday, the BiH Court sentenced Covic, a former BiH presidency member, to five years in prison for abuse of office during an earlier term as a cabinet minister. 
His lawyers are appealing the ruling.

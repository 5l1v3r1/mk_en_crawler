SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The relatives of five Bulgarian nurses, sentenced to death by Libya in a controversial HIV infection case, have left for Tripoli with permission to visit the medics in prison there. 
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said on Monday (January 8th) that the relatives would be allowed to visit with the detainees every day until January 17th. 
A planned visit by Bulgarian Deputy Justice Minister Margarit Ganev has been postponed due to a lack of permission from Tripoli.
Meanwhile, the National Federation of Belgian Nurses announced that it has collected 16,000 signatures thus far in a petition to abolish the death sentence of the five nurses and a Palestinian doctor who was also tried in the case.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Kosovo Albanian negotiation team has set up an informal liaison office in New York, according to team co-ordinator Blerim Shala. 
On Friday (April 6th), he explained that since it was a temporary diplomatic office, Pristina did not need permission from UNMIK. 
UN Resolution 1244 bars interim Kosovar institutions from opening diplomatic offices. 
According to local media reports, the office would lobby and provide information to the UN Security Council as it considers the province's future status.

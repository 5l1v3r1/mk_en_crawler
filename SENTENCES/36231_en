TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE Presence in Albania released a report Wednesday (3 March), which concludes that pre-trial detention conditions in the country remain problematic. 
The document points to a lack of basic living conditions in the packed detention centres, and also cites mistreatment of juveniles and women. 
The report is based on the results of a survey conducted in 25 pre-trial detention centres throughout Albania.
Also Wednesday, Albania and Belgium signed a bilateral co-operation agreement aimed at boosting ties. 
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano says he would like to see the eventual removal of EU country visa requirements for Albanians.

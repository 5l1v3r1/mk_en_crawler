BUCHAREST, Romania -- The law on the majority voting system proposed by the Romanian government is considered adopted, as no party in parliament tabled a no-confidence vote over it. 
The cabinet formally offered it to parliament on Monday (October 29th), and the deadline for challenging it expired on Thursday.
Earlier, the main opposition parties -- the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party -- indicated they would not challenge the measure, in light of the November 25th referendum on the same issue. 
The law now needs to be enacted by President Traian Basescu, but he has said he would wait for the referendum's results before deciding how to proceed.

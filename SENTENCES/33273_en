BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Presidential elections in Serbia will be called only after the new constitution of the republic is adopted, according to Serbian Parliament Speaker and acting President Natasa Micic. 
On Monday (9 June), she said the constitutional commission is doing an excellent job, adding that she hopes the constitution will be adopted in the autumn.
In other news Monday, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic called on UNMIK to stop transferring powers to interim Kosovo institutions. 
He called for stricter international supervision, and linked last week's murder of a Kosovo Serb family to the acceleration of the transfer process.

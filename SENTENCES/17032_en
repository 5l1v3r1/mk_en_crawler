BUCHAREST, Romania -- Austrian President Heinz Fischer voiced support for Romaniaâs scheduled January 2007 accession into the EU, as he began a two-day official visit to Bucharest Tuesday (2 May). 
Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. 
Meeting with counterpart Traian Basescu, Fischer added that the simultaneous accession of Romania and Bulgaria next year would be "fair" and "in the interest of the EU". 
Basescu, in turn, said uncoupling the two countries would be a political mistake.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU said on Thursday (April 23rd) it supports a road map to normalise relations between Turkey and Armenia announced by the two countries Wednesday. 
"We are pleased to see progress in the normalisation of relations," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in a joint statement. 
Azerbaijan's foreign ministry also welcomed the move and expressed hope it would help resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
The road map envisions several steps to mend bilateral ties such as opening border crossings between the two countries, signing agreements to boost trade relations and establishing a joint commission of historians to deal with the so-called Armenian genocide issue, in which representatives of third countries would participate. 
Turkey and Armenia have had no diplomatic relations for more than a decade. 
Turkey closed its border in 1993 in response to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
Another contentious issue is the killings of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917, which Yerevan insists was genocide.
However, the drive to normalise Turkish-Armenian relations sparked angry reactions in Yerevan. 
The nationalist party Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) criticised the road map agreement Thursday, saying there should be no deal with Ankara before Turkey recognises the 1915 incidents as "genocide". 
The party threatened to leave the country's ruling coalition over the initiative. 
Several thousand protesters burned a Turkish flag during a traditional march in Yerevan to commemorate the 1915 incidents.

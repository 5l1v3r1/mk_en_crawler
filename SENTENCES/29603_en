PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of Kosovo's delegation in the dialogue with Serbia, Edita Tahiri, has acknowledged for the first time that problems in northern Kosovo can be part of this process.
There will be no division or a special status for the north, but the dialogue will tackle Martti Ahtisaari's proposal that involves blocking Belgrade's influence in that area, Tahiri said on Wednesday (April 27th) while visiting the American University of Kosovo.
Meanwhile, newspapers in Pristina quoted Serbia's chief negotiator, Borko Stefanovic, as saying that he is ready to talk about any topic but will not compromise regarding Kosovo.
He says Pristina has continuously reiterated its statehood, which has not been easy.
Stefanovic said that he will protect Serbia's Constitution and regard Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The European Investment Bank (EIB) and UNMIK signed an agreement Tuesday (3 May) that would enable the province to get loans from the EU institution despite its unresolved final status. 
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said the move should encourage other financial institutions to provide loans to Kosovo and facilitate the province's economic recovery. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi also sealed the document, indicating that the interim provincial government would serve as loan guarantor. 
The EIB finances investments that promote European integration.

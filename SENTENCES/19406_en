SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A BiH court sentenced former Bosnian Muslim soldier Idhan Sipic to eight years in prison Friday (February 22nd) for war crimes. 
Sipic, 40, confessed to murdering an elderly Serb woman in the northwestern village of Korjenovo Brdo in September 1995. 
This was the first war crimes case to be resolved under a plea bargain agreement with state prosecutors.
Also Friday, the court confirmed an indictment against Ivica Vrdoljak. 
A member of the Croatian Defence Council in 1992, Vrdoljak is accused of the mistreatment and torture of civilians in the towns of Polje and Bosanski Brod.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's right-wing opposition parties have not yet agreed on a possible coalition in elections later this year, Skopje A1 TV reported over the weekend.
It said the main obstacle to such a coalition would be deciding on who should assume the lead role:
VMRO-DPMNE chairman Nikola Gruevski or former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who formed the party VMRO-NP after splitting from VMRO-DPMNE.
On Saturday (25 February), Georgievski announced that he would be VMRO-NP's nominee for prime minister, if the party or its potential coalition wins the next elections.

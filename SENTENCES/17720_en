ATHENS, Greece -- Turkey is not ready to join the EU "tomorrow nor the day after tomorrow", but its membership negotiations should continue, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told Greece's Kathimerini newspaper on Sunday (July 22nd).
Barroso called on France and other member states to honour the decision to continue accession talks, describing it as a matter of credibility for the Union.
Turkey's accession negotiations began in 2005 but have been stalled due to Ankara's refusal to open its ports to EU-member Cyprus.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Thursday (September 17th) urged the new government to continue its efforts to advance along its EU path.
In a letter congratulating Prime Minister Sali Berisha on his re-election, Rehn assured the new government that it can rely on the European Commission's assistance, and urged the government to work with the opposition on further European reforms.
Rehn added that Albania must prove it has the capacity to take the next step in EU integration -- visa-free travel with EU countries -- by improving the rule of law and strengthening democratic institutions.

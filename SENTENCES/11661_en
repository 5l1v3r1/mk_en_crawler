BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During their meeting in Brussels Monday (18 July), the EU foreign ministers decided to postpone until September the debate on whether to launch membership talks with Croatia. 
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw reiterated that negotiations would start as soon as there is evidence Zagreb is fully co-operating with The Hague tribunal. 
The arrest of fugitive indictee Ante Gotovina is crucial to co-operation.
In Washington, meanwhile, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader meets on Tuesday with US President George W. 
Bush. 
The focus likely will be Zagreb's EU and NATO accession bids. 
The latest Eurobarometer poll, published on Monday by the European Commission, finds that among states in the region, Croatia is the most preferred potential EU member.

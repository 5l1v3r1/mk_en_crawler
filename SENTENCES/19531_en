ANKARA, Turkey -- The president of the Kurdish regional government in Iraq said in an interview published on Tuesday (October 30th) that he would not take orders from Turkey on how to deal with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Massud Barzani told Turkey's Milliyet newspaper that he regrets Ankara's refusal to hold talks with his administration on ending attacks by Kurdish guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
He came close to accusing Ankara of using the PKK as a pretext for launching an operation against the Iraqi Kurdish province, asking are "we ... 
the real problem in Ankara's eyes and not the PKK? 
We want assurances from Turkey that all these military measures are not against us." Turkey has amassed approximately 100,000 troops near the border with Iraq after a series of deadly attacks by the PKK.

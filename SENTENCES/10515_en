THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic's court-appointed lawyers told the tribunal Tuesday (14 September) that they would ask for a suspension of the proceedings, pending a ruling by an appeals panel. 
The two British lawyers have appealed the court's decision to appoint them to represent Milosevic. 
They are expected to file the motion for suspension later on Wednesday, when the judges are scheduled to hold a hearing on procedural matters.

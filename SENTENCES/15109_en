ANKARA, Turkey -- Court of Appeals chief prosecutor Nuri Ok asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday (30 November) to warn the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) that its statute contains undemocratic language, with certain clauses granting excessive power to the party's leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In June, the Court of Appeals called on AKP to amend the provisions in question but the party refused.

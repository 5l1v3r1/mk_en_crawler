ZAGREB, Croatia -- An estimated 15,000 people signed a petition to hold a referendum on the country's NATO bid Sunday (March 30th).
Effective Monday, citizens will also be able sign the petition online at www.natonareferendum.org.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Sunday that if enough signatures are collected, a referendum will be scheduled.
The latest polls show support for Croatia's NATO bid has been growing and is currently at around 70%.
Organisers of the petition have said that they neither support nor oppose accession to the organisation, but believe the public has the right to express its opinion.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU envoy Miroslav Lajcak said in Brussels Tuesday (14 February) that the Union is proposing two formulas regarding the margin needed for a successful "yes" vote in the upcoming Montenegrin referendum on independence. 
Speaking to local media, he said one formula would require at least 55 per cent of participating voters to back independence. 
The other calls for a minimum of 41 per cent of all registered, eligible voters in Montenegro to approve the split. 
Lajcak said either alternative would require acceptance both by the ruling coalition and the opposition bloc. 
He returns to Podgorica Wednesday (15 February) (Politika - 15/02/06; Mina, Tanjug, B92 - 14/02/06)

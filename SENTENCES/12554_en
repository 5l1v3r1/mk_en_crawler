ZAGREB, Croatia -- A joint operation by Croatian police, the counterintelligence agency and the commission against organised crime has resulted in the smashing of an international channel for illegal arms trade, interior ministry spokesman Zlatko Mehun announced on Monday (4 July).
He said the action, conducted over a span of two days, included searches of dwellings and cars, and that a significant amount of weapons was seized.
In all, 11 people were detained in Zagreb and the surrounding area.
In other news Monday, the outgoing head of the European Commission's delegation in Zagreb, Ambassador Jacques Wunenburger, met with Croatian President Stipe Mesic.
Wunenburger said that the country had made great progress over the past four years and that it was "a matter of weeks or maybe two or three months" before EU accession talks begin.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Finnish mobile-phone maker Nokia opened a new plant Monday (February 11th) in Cluj, western Romania, that is expected to create 15,000 jobs.
Output will be destined for European, Middle-Eastern and African markets.
Cluj Mayor Emil Boc said that with the opening, local industry has completely left behind communism.
Nokia, however, has been criticised recently for moving its production facilities out of Germany, leaving 2,300 people jobless.

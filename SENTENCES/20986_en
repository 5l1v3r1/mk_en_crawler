BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament rejected on Wednesday (October 3rd) the no-confidence vote against the government of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu tabled by the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD). 
The PSD's motion, dubbed "1,000 days of chaos", was supported by two other opposition parties that joined the PSD in accusing the cabinet of failing to govern efficiently. 
The government, comprised of just two parties -- the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- has rejected these claims. 
It now must adopt important legislation, including next year's budget, with just 20% of seats in parliament.

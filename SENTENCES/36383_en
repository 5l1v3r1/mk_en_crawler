TRIPOLI, Libya -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy arrived in Tripoli late on Tuesday (18 May) for talks with his Libyan counterpart, Abdel Rahman Shalgham, on the fate of five Bulgarian nurses. 
They were sentenced to death for allegedly spreading the AIDS virus among hundreds of children in a hospital in Benghazi. 
Before leaving for Libya, Passy discussed the case with European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi, who reiterated the EC's support for a fair sentence.

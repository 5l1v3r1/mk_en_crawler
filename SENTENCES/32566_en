SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Croatia and BiH signed an agreement on cross-border traffic and co-operation on Wednesday (5 March).
The deal will set up 25 border crossings, permitting nearby residents to travel with special long-term border passes.
Twelve of the crossings will launch operations soon.
Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino Picula said the countries also moved close to an agreement on the Croatian seaport of Ploce.
His BiH counterpart, Mladen Ivanic, explained the countries would exchange protocols regulating joint management issues of the port.
Also Wednesday, the BiH Parliamentary House of Representatives adopted changes in the law on citizenship, extending the deadline for signing dual citizenship agreements with other states to 2013.
The amendments were imposed last December by the international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown.

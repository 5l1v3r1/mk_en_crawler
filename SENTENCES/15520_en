BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have arrested a key suspect in the 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Aleksandar Simovic, 30, a former member of the so-called Zemun clan, was taken into custody with another suspect in Belgrade early Saturday (November 25th).
He is one of 13 defendants in the trial of Djindjic's suspected assassins.
Five suspects remain at large, including Simonovic's brother, Milos.
The brothers are accused of murdering a protected witness for the prosecution in June.
They are suspected of involvement in a number of other gangland slayings and in the kidnapping of a businessman in 2001.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament voted Wednesday (21 January) to formally recognise the Albanian language university in Tetovo and approve its annual funding by the state.
Opposition VMRO-DPMNE lawmakers staged a walkout in protest.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski supported the resolution, saying that it was part of the Ohrid Peace Accords, and that it removes any excuse by extremists to provoke a new conflict.

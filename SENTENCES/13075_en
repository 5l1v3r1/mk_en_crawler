STRASBOURG, France -- European Parliament President Josep Borrell on Tuesday (27 September) praised efforts made by Croatia to meet its obligations to the EU. 
During a meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader in Strasbourg, he also voiced hope that Zagreb would do more to solve the last problem blocking the start of EU accession talks -- namely, its failure to hand over war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina to The Hague tribunal. 
Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte will be in Croatia on Friday to assess the level of co-operation. 
She is to draw up a report on the matter for an EU ministerial task force that meets Sunday in Luxembourg.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano warned on Saturday (30 October) that next month's referendum in Macedonia could threaten stability in the entire region.
"This referendum, or other initiatives incited by extremist elements, could place the stability of Albania, of Kosovo and other countries in the Balkans who want an end to violence between peoples and ethnic groups in danger," he said.
Nano called on all Macedonians to work for peace and improved coexistence.
He also urged ethnic Albanians in Macedonia to stay away from what he described as extremists.

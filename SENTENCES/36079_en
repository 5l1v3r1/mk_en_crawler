DUBLIN, Ireland -- Prime Minister Bertie Ahern met with his Macedonian counterpart, Branko Crvenkovski, on Monday (22 March) and accepted Skopje's formal application for membership in the EU. 
Ireland currently holds the Union's rotating presidency. 
The bid was to have been submitted on 26 February, the day President Boris Trajkovki died in a plane crash. 
Ahern praised Macedonia's progress in recent years and said he is convinced that it would eventually become a member of the EU. 
Crvenkovski stressed that all Macedonian citizens agree the country has no other alternative but EU integration. 
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana congratulated Macedonia, saying its application is a sign of hope for the Balkans.

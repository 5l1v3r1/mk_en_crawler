BUCHAREST, Romania -- Balkan leaders met in Bucharest on Tuesday (December 19th) to sign a deal that would expand the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
The group, which originally included Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia, will now be joined by Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
The deal envisions the creation of a network to replace more than 30 bilateral free trade agreements, thus liberalising more than 90% of all trade in the SEE region.
Bulgaria and Romania will drop out after their accessions in January.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's government adopted a national programme for NATO membership for 2004-2005 at its Friday (17 September) session.
The document sets the opening of membership talks with the Pact and fulfilment of all required reforms as a priority.
It also calls for future expansion of the Croatian participation in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, as well as for an initiative to train Iraqi policemen in Croatia.
The government plans to present the paper to NATO by the end of September.

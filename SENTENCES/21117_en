SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's financial police charged Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski on Wednesday (August 1st) with embezzling around 3m euros. 
Buckovski, who was defence minister at the time, allegedly abused his office in connection with an October 2001 deal to procure spare parts for tanks. 
According to the indictment, ministry funds meant for the company MZP-FOP instead ended up in a special account for Buckovski and the company's director. 
Buckovski, who is not currently in Macedonia, has pledged to co-operate with the investigation. 
Retired Army Chief of Staff General Metodi Stamboliski was arrested Tuesday in connection with the case. 
Reports say he ordered four times more spare parts than necessary, causing around 2m euros in losses to the state. 
He retired in March 2004.

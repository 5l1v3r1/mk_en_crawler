ATHENS, Greece -- On Saturday (23 November), hundreds of motorcyclists protested on the streets of Athens against new traffic regulations imposed by the government.
The procession began at the Panathenaic stadium and ended at parliament, where a delegation of motorcyclists handed a petition to deputies.
The protestors say the excessive regulations would only worsen the city's traffic congestion.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc on Wednesday (February 9th) fired the head of the customs department amid an anti-corruption sweep.
The catalyst, prosecutors say, was involvement in the case of a woman who paid 43,000 euros to get a job at a customs checkpoint on the border with Ukraine.
Also Wednesday, as part of the ongoing operation against customs corruption, authorities arrested around 100 people suspected of involvement in cigarette smuggling from Serbia.
Last week, 59 customs officials were detained in a similar operation at the border with Ukraine.

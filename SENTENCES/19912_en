PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Deputy UNMIK chief Steven Schook left his post in Kosovo two weeks ahead of schedule. 
At a press conference Wednesday (December 19th), UNMIK Spokesman Alexander Ivanko denied that Schook was withdrawn from the mission due to an ongoing corruption investigation against him. 
The UN Office of Internal Oversight Services is looking into whether Schook, a retired US Army general, intervened on behalf of some Kosovo Albanian leaders, particularly former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who is on trial at The Hague for war crimes committed in 1998 against Serbs and ethnic Albanians who collaborated with them.

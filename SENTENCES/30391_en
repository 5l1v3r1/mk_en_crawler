PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament member and former transport and telecommunication minister Fatmir Limaj said on Thursday (March 17th) he is ready to give up his immunity after being informed that EULEX issued an arrest warrant against him for suspected war crimes committed in 1999. 
Another 11 former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) were arrested for allegedly ordering and conducting torture in a Kosovo camp.
Reacting to the arrests, President Behgjet Pacolli expressed concern, saying "we strongly believe that the war of the KLA was just and aimed at liberating Kosovo people." Two separate protests were held to show support for the 12.

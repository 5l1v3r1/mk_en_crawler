BUCHAREST, Romania -- Public servants announced on Monday (October 6th) they would launch a warning strike Thursday, after talks on salary hikes between trade union representatives and Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian failed. 
Public servants demand a 50% pay hike to match the salary increase granted to teachers. 
The union that represents healthcare workers is also demanding a 50% wage hike for its members.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN special envoy in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, Matthew Nimitz, refused to reveal on Tuesday (October 23rd) whether he plans to table a new proposal.
"I don't think it would be wise to do such a thing.
I will see how the meeting goes and I will make some recommendations only if they would benefit the procedure," Nimitz told a Macedonian TV channel ahead of a meeting next week between the two sides.
He acknowledged the importance of resolving the matter before NATO's April summit in Bucharest.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A senior navy official arrested for alleged involvement in a plot to destabilise the government of the ruling Justice and Development Party was released on bail Friday (November 13th). 
Colonel Dursun Cicek was charged on Wednesday with "belonging to a terrorist organisation" after a secret document he allegedly had prepared -- describing ways to destabilise the government -- was leaked to the media in June. 
He was detained briefly in July but was released.

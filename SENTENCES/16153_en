TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party again failed to agree on the exact date of the next local elections, during a meeting Friday (15 September), organised by President Alfred Moisiu.
By law, the next vote must be held between 20 December and 20 January.
The opposition insists that turnout would be higher if the election were held in milder weather.
Moisiu reportedly told the two main parties to step up efforts to reach an agreement or he would pick a date himself.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said late on Monday (May 21st) that his government would put more resources into locating and arresting Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic and other fugitives from justice. 
In his most explicit pledge of co-operation, Kostunica said the indictees "should be located, detained and handed over to The Hague tribunal". 
The EU has set Mladic's arrest as a condition for the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia.
In other news, Serbian police have cracked a large criminal group believed to be stealing luxury cars in Western Europe and selling them in the Middle East. 
Eleven suspects have been arrested in Belgrade and seven more in other Serbian cities.

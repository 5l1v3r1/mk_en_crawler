BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) says Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn will present a new EU assistance package for the Balkans that aims to facilitate economic growth and cushion regional tensions that have flared since Kosovo declared independence last month.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia would all benefit from the assistance.
Sources say the new set of measures includes easing the visa regime, offering more students access to EU scholarships, increased lending by the European Investment Bank, and the extension of EU road and rail infrastructures.
In other news, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak is urging BiH leaders to seek common ground in finalising reforms required for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
Lajcak was in Brussels Tuesday (March 4th) to brief the EU Political and Security Committee on the conclusions of last week's Peace Implementation Council meeting.
He said the political situation must improve.

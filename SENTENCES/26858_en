TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) says it will organise protests if talks on overcoming the current political stalemate, mediated by President Bamir Topi, fail. 
SP lawmakers have been boycotting the work of parliament since September, insisting on a thorough investigation into general elections last June, which they say were marred by serious violations. 
Both the SP and the ruling Democratic Party have agreed to participate in talks mediated by Topi to try and overcome the crisis. 
Topi is expected to begin contacting representatives of the two sides Monday (February 8th).

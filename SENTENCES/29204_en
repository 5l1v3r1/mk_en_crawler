BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY), Rasim Ljajic, said Monday (April 5th) that the declaration of the Serbian parliament condemning Srebrenica crimes will not influence a forthcoming report of ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz.
Ljajic confirmed that the Brammertz will visit Serbia in May before submitting his report on Belgrade's co-operation with the ICTY to the UN Security Council in June.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Three Serbian democratic parties sealed an agreement Thursday (19 February) to form a coalition government. 
The parties include the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), New Serbia and G17 Plus. 
The Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), the other party of the democratic bloc, is to formally join Friday, after a meeting of the parliamentary group and the party's leadership. 
DSS leader Vojislav Kostunica said the agreement has "elements of the government's programme and structure". 
Vuk Draskovic, the leader of SPO, had some reservations but confirms all his demands have been met.

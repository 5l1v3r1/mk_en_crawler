PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith believes the mandate of supervised independence is approaching its end in Kosovo.
Supervision from the international community should not continue a minute longer than necessary, Feith said during a visit Thursday (April 21st) to a high school in Pristina.
A day earlier, he said that the end of supervision depends on Kosovo's progress.
As for amending the constitution regarding presidential elections and electoral reforms, Feith said he will assist but not influence this process, which is in the hands of parliament.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Representatives of Belgrade and Podgorica on Sunday (5 September) praised the stance adopted at the EU foreign ministers' meeting in the Netherlands, which envisages a "twin track" approach towards Serbia and Montenegro on economic and trade issues, but backs preservation of the federal union.
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said the approach would help speed up Serbia-Montenegro's EU integration, while respecting differences between the two republics.
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic also expressed satisfaction with the EU approach, though he reiterated the desire for an independence referendum.
Separately, the EU foreign ministers renewed their call for Serbs to vote in the 23 October elections in Kosovo, while acknowledging security concerns.
Belgrade has urged Kosovo Serbs to boycott the vote.

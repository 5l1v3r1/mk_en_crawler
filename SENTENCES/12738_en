PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Kosovo Assembly voted on Friday (3 December) to elect Ramush Haradinaj as prime minister.
Serbia immediately protested the appointment of the 36-year-old ethnic Albanian, claiming that he was responsible for war crimes while he served as KLA commander.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said he would send letters to UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen, the UN Security Council and the EU, demanding the decision be annulled.
Haradinaj was questioned by UN prosecutors recently but has not been charged.
He is to present his new cabinet members and his government programme to the legislature within days.

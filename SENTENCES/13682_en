ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic urged the government Sunday (20 November) to tackle crime, voicing concern over the security situation in the country.
Speaking to reporters, Mesic said the interior ministry and parliament must react to "worrisome" statistics indicating a jump in crimes -- including violent robbery.
Equally troubling, he noted, is the rate of unsolved crimes.
Also Sunday, Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt announced that she would urge parliament to decriminalise defamation and to remove a provision from the criminal code that requires jail time for those convicted of slander or libel.
She would replace it with a fine.

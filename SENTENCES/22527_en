BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia will be eligible for EU membership in three years if it meets all criteria, according to a European Parliament (EP) declaration published on Wednesday (April 9th) that detailed the progress of accession negotiations.
It concluded that Croatia had made very favourable progress but that much remained to be done and that there was no time to lose.
For the first time since negotiations began in 2005, the European Commission has committed to offering a schedule for completing the accession process.
If the process proceeds on track, Croatia can complete negotiations in the autumn of 2009 and become a member early in 2011.

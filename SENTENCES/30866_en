PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX Deputy Head of Mission Andy Sparks says the mission wants to reinforce the rule of law, not only in the north but throughout Kosovo.
Fighting corruption and organised crime is EULEX's priority, media quoted Sparks as telling the Belgrade-based daily Politika on Wednesday (February 9th).
He announced that in the coming days and weeks, both EULEX Police and KFOR will step up activities on both sides of the Ibar River that divides Mitrovica.

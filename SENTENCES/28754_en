BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian Defence Minister Anyu Angelov said on Friday (June 11th) that Bulgaria will send more troops and military instructors to its mission in Afghanistan. 
Following a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels, Angelov said that by the end of this year, the number of Bulgarian troops serving in the ISAF will climb from 530 to 600. 
He added that a planned downsizing of NATO's forces in Kosovo will not affect the 48 Bulgarian troops deployed there.

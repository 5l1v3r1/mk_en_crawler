ANKARA, Turkey -- The recent UN resolution recognising the interim governing council in Iraq would facilitate Turkey's decision on sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq, according to diplomatic sources cited by the local press on Sunday (17 August). 
The government has reportedly welcomed the new resolution and could send peacekeepers if invited by the interim governing council. 
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer insists, however, that Turkish troops be sent only under a broader international initiative, preferably UN or NATO-led.

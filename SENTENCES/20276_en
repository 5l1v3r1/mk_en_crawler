ATHENS, Greece -- Greece is paralysed Wednesday (February 13th) by a 24-hour nationwide strike being held to protest the government's planned pension reforms.
The strike is being organised by the two biggest trade unions in the country, the ADEDY and the GSEE, and will be joined by workers from the transport, medical, legal, education and media sectors.
This is the second nationwide strike in the country in the past two months.

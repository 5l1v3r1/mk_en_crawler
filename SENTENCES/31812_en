BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Prime Minister-designate Dragan Mikerevic will announce members of the new government by 13 January, clearing the way for parliament to discuss the ministerial nominations later that week. 
A spokesman for Mikerevic's Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) says there was agreement on distribution of ministerial posts in the new cabinet between PDP and the nationalist Serb Democratic Party, but not with the Union of Independent Social Democrats, headed by former Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
Meanwhile, the BiH Parliamentary House of Representatives agreed to postpone debate on the composition of the new BiH Council of Ministers. 
The postponement comes at the request of the Office of the High Representative, which wants to assess all nominees.

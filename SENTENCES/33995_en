BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The US administration is expected to authorise normalisation of trade relations with Serbia-Montenegro on Monday (3 November), says Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic.
Officials from the US embassy confirmed that a decision was expected "very soon".
Belgrade-based B92, quoting unidentified sources, says the decision already has been made and would simply be announced this week.
Assistant Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandra Joksimovic said normalisation is crucial to the economy.

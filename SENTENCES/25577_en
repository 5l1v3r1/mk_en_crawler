BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc's government comfortably survived a no-confidence vote Thursday (September 24th) initiated by the opposition National Liberal Party and Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, over three bills, drafted at the recommendation of the IMF. 
The bills are aimed at reforming the public sector and cover a single wage system in the public sector, education reform and public administration reform. 
Only 112 lawmakers backed the motion, which needed 236 votes to succeed. 
With the motion rejected, the three measures are considered adopted. 
President Traian Basescu must next sign them.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- US Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasian Affairs Philip Gordon said on Thursday (January 20th) that the status quo in the divided island of Cyprus has gone on far too long and everyone loses from its perpetuation. 
Visiting Nicosia, he met with leaders of both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. 
President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu are to meet next week in Geneva with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to brief him about the progress in the negotiation process and decide on the next steps. 
Gordon said that the two sides are not on the verge of a deal but there is still hope.

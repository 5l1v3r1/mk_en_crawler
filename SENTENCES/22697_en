TIRANA, Albania -- Three people suffered injuries and three others are missing after a building collapsed on Sunday (November 9th) in the southern city of Gjirokastra.
Authorities think three women are still trapped under the rubble.
Investigators say the collapse likely stemmed from construction work on an adjacent building.
Police have detained 12 people, including two who allegedly tried to escape into Greece.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Tycoon and politician Cem Uzan was sentenced on Thursday (April 15th) to 23 years in prison for setting up a criminal ring, forging official documents and swindling. 
Uzan, who once owned the country's second biggest mobile operator and several banks, missed Thursday's court session. 
The leader of the populist Youth Party lives in France, where he is seeking asylum. 
Paris is considering Turkey's request for his extradition while Uzan says he is the victim of a political "lynching campaign" by the Ankara government.

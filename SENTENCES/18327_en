BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than a month after Foreign Affairs Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu submitted his resignation, President Traian Basescu announced that he had approved it Tuesday (March 13th).
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu asked the Constitutional Court to mediate his dispute with the president over the appointment of Liberal Senator Adrian Cioroianu as the new foreign minister.
Ungureanu resigned on February 2nd at Tariceanu's request, after two Romanians were arrested for taking unauthorised photos at a military facility in Iraq.

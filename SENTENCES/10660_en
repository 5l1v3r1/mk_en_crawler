THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A former Bosnian Serb officer charged with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes pleaded not guilty Thursday (11 November) at the UN tribunal in The Hague. 
Ljubisa Beara was indicted for his alleged role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
As security chief of the Bosnian Serb army at the time, Neara was in charge of transporting Muslim prisoners.
In other news, Slobodan Milosevic asked the UN court on Thursday to summon former US President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to take the witness stand. 
Presiding Judge Patrick Robinson told Milosevic that he would have to persuade the judges that each witness could provide an "element of proof" of his innocence.
UN prosecutors held a second interview with former senior KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj on Thursday. 
Haradinaj, now a leading Kosovo politician, told reporters that he has no further obligations to the tribunal.

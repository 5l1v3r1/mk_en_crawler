SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev on Sunday (September 28th) denied claims that the recently established National Security Agency has been tapping the personal phones of several lawmakers. 
Stanishev downplayed the accusations as "intentional" efforts to undermine the agency's authority. 
The scandal erupted last week when lawmakers told parliament that the agency had tapped their phones, as well as those of certain businessmen, for political purposes. 
Stanishev also denied that agency director Petko Sertov has been aware of the illegal tapping. 
But a senior agency officer insists Sertov knows about all agency activities.

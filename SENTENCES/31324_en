ATHENS, Greece -- The Federation of Greek Sailors on Tuesday (November 30th) stopped their eight-day strike after the government issued an emergency order against it. 
The protest had snarled travel and triggered food shortages on some islands. 
Launched last Tuesday, the strike was aimed at reaching a collective labour agreement that won't deprive sailors of any benefits or rights. 
This was the second time in several months that the government threatened to arrest strikers unless they returned to their jobs. 
The first was against protesting truck drivers.

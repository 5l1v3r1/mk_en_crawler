BJELASNICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of state-level and entity institutions made some progress during Thursday's (1 September) round of negotiations on police reforms, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic announced afterwards.
He said all parties agreed on the establishment of a forensics institute and an agency for police standards that will deal with issues related to training, uniforms and other issues.
An agreement on the principles of financing police was also reached, specifying that there would be a consolidated budget.
However, neither a reform proposal by the RS government nor one by the BiH Council of Ministers received approval.
Negotiations are scheduled to continue next week.
An agreement must be reached soon if BiH is to start negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement by year's end.

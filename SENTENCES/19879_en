NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat have agreed to resume talks on reunifying the island.
The deal was struck during a meeting Friday (March 21st) at the UN buffer zone in the capital.
These were the first such high-profile talks since July 2006.
The two leaders also agreed to re-open a key crossing in Nicosia.
Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been divided since 1974, when Turkey deployed troops to the island after a coup by Greek Cypriots.
Christofias had made reunification a centrepiece of his recent presidential campaign.

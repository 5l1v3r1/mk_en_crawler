NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic ended on Saturday (September 27th) an almost weeklong initiative to secure the UN General Assembly's backing for Serbia's initiative to seek the opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of the self-proclaimed independence of Kosovo. 
Jeremic told FoNet on Saturday that the UN General Assembly will vote on Serbia's initiative on October 8th. 
He said the next ten days will be crucial to determine whether his country will win the majority of votes at the Assembly.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The present level of Croatia's external debt does not pose a direct threat to the economy but should be monitored closely, the head of the IMF mission to Croatia said Saturday (13 September), after a meeting with President Stipe Mesic. 
Hans Flickenschild urged the Croatian National Bank and the government to prevent external debt growth and reduce the deficit. 
On a positive note, he said economic growth is stronger than expected this year, while inflation is lower than expected.

ANKARA, Turkey -- In an article in the Daily Telegraph Monday (June 11th), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn again urged French President Nikolas Sarkozy not to veto EU accession negotiations with Turkey. 
Rehn noted the opening of talks was unanimously approved by all EU member states and stressed that if talks are blocked, it would cause "a clash of civilisations". 
He described Turkey's accession as the defining geopolitical issue of the century. 
Sarkozy proposes some form of privileged partnership instead for Turkey.

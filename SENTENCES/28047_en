ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of thousands of state employees are staging a 24-hour strike Thursday (April 22nd) against harsh austerity measures the government has announced in a bid to end the financial crisis. 
The protesters insist that the move to cut salaries in the public sector and raise consumer taxes are pointless since such cost-cutting efforts may actually lengthen the recession. 
The strike is affecting all state institutions.
On Wednesday, IMF and EU experts began talks in Athens on a possible 45 billion-euro package of financial aid. 
Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou says the talks will last two weeks. 
Greece has repeatedly said it is up to Athens to decide if it needs the money.
In other news Wednesday, police smashed a cigarette smuggling operation that has allegedly sold 3 million packs of cigarettes since the beginning of the year, causing losses of 9m euros to the state budget. 
Police seized about 100,000 packs of cigarettes at a hangar in Acharnon, northwest of Athens, along with weapons and ammunition.

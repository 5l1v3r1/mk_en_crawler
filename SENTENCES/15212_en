SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A 52-year old man from Strumica, in southeast Macedonia, has died in a Skopje hospital from bird flu-like symptoms, according to local media reports Friday (28 April).
The man, who bred doves, was admitted on Tuesday in poor condition and died Thursday.
The head of the state veterinary department, Sloboden Cokrevski, says around six of the doves tested positive for the general flu A type virus.
Samples were sent to a lab in Britain to determine whether it was the deadly H5N1 virus strain of avian influenza.
Culling and disinfections are under way in Strumica.

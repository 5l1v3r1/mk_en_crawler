SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A remark Wednesday (22 March) by European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva has sparked controversy in Sofia.
Addressing the High Judicial Council, Kuneva suggested that experts with the European Commission (EC) are suggesting activation of the safeguard clause -- delaying EU membership for a year -- because of dissatisfaction with constitutional changes currently being discussed by parliament.
The Bulgarian Socialist Party, senior partner in the ruling coalition, said Kuneva should have made her concerns known to parliament instead of the magistrates and the press.
She has been summoned to parliament to explain.
In other news, the government said on Wednesday it had approved a national programme to improve housing conditions for the 10 per cent Roma minority.
The effort is part of a larger international Roma-inclusion effort launched last year.

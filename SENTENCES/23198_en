ANKARA, Turkey -- Fishermen trolling for tuna in the Mediterranean Sea attacked a Greenpeace ship on Friday (May 30th), pelting it with lead fishing weights. 
No one aboard was injured. 
The Greenpeace crew had used a helicopter earlier in the day to document what the organisation describes as excessive fishing in a channel between Turkey and Cyprus. 
Greenpeace wants it declared a protected zone, since it is a main breeding area for blue fin tuna.

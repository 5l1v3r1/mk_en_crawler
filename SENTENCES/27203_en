PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Italian Ambassador to Kosovo Michael Giffoni will serve as the EU's "facilitator" in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo, media quoted sources from Brussels and Pristina as saying on Thursday (October 1st).
However, Brussels denied that Giffoni will be "special" envoy, emphasising that his duties would be limited to facilitating or co-ordinating actions in the north, where the situation is more complicated than in other parts of Kosovo.

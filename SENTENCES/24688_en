SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) elected Goran Georgiev, Zoran Zaev and Zoran Jovanovski as its new deputy presidents on Sunday (June 7th).
Andrej Petrov became the new secretary of the party at a SDSM congress in Ohrid.
Ousted from top posts were popular figures, including Vlado Buckovski and Radmila Sekerinska.
The changes follow former President Branko Crvenkovski's return to the helm of the SDSM in late May.

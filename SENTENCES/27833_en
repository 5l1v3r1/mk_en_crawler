ZAGREB, Croatia -- Trade unions have managed to gather well over the 450,000 signatures required to call a referendum on proposed amendments to the labour law. 
Ozren Matijasevic, chairman of the trade unions association, told a press conference Thursday (June 24th) that they have collected over 720,000 signatures, with more on the way. 
He called the moment a historic one for Croatia. 
The proposed labour law would set a six-month deadline for hammering out a new collective agreement after the existing one expires. 
After that, the workers' rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers. 
The unions started collecting signatures on June 9th. 
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Thursday that the government will respect the views of those who signed the petition, though the referendum -- costing about 23m euros -- would be a significant budget expense.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- German President Horst Koehler urged Romania, the EU's newest member together with Bulgaria, to redouble its efforts against corruption. 
"It's in Romania's interest to continue the fight against corruption and also to put in place an independent judiciary and an efficient administration," he said after a meeting with counterpart Traian Basescu in Bucharest on Monday (July 2nd). 
The European Commission just issued a report criticising both countries' record in fighting graft. 
On Tuesday, Koehler visits Sibiu, before heading to Bulgaria.

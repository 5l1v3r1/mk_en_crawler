BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors pressed murder charges against a nurse Monday (August 23rd) in connection with the deadly fire that broke out a week ago at the Giulesti Maternity Hospital in Bucharest.
In all, five newborns died as a result of the blaze in an intensive care unit.
Florentina Daniela Cirstea will face court on Tuesday for failing to constantly supervise the newborns on August 16th.
According to the prosecution, she left the unit unattended for 12 minutes and was then unable to evacuate or rescue the newborns after the fire broke out.
Investigators say it started in an electric cable attached to an air-conditioning unit and quickly spread through the room.

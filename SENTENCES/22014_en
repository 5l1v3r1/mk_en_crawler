PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (September 18th) he expects Serbia's integration to the EU to accelerate in 2009. 
Speaking in Prague at a conference on relations between the EU and the Western Balkans, Rehn stressed that Serbia would likely obtain candidate status next year. 
He characterised the forthcoming Czech presidency of the EU in the first half of 2009 as a key period for the Western Balkans and a time when their aspirations to join the EU will receive a real boost.
Regarding Macedonia, Rehn said the EU will assess the implementation of key priorities outlined in the Accession Partnership, particularly in the fields of judicial reform, administrative reform and electoral standards. 
Implementing their Stabilisation and Association Agreements is the main challenge facing Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rehn said.
He described Kosovo as a focal point during the Czech presidency of the EU, pointing out the importance of a successful deployment of the EULEX mission there.
Accession talks with Croatia are proceeding well, Rehn said, adding he expects most of the remaining negotiating chapters will be opened this autumn. 
Negotiators could close many chapters by next spring, which would allow completion of technical talks by the end of next year, Rehn said.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The main opposition party Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) decided Tuesday (13 May) to seek a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg over the "failure of his domestic policy". 
The UDF views early elections as the best scenario, but says that would depend on its success in local elections planned for the autumn. 
Saxe-Coburg's party says the motion will fail.

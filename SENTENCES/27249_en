BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament approved on Monday (August 31st) a controversial law on information that, in part, tightens libel penalties.
The bill was adopted by a vote of 125 to 100, with 11 abstentions.
A total of 25 lawmakers were absent.
All partners in the ruling coalition backed the bill except for the Socialist Party of Serbia, whose representatives abstained, as promised.
The bill was widely criticised by media organisations as it creates broad grounds for lawsuits, provides draconian fines for violating ethical norms and allows information to be published that jeopardises juveniles or violates the presumption of innocence.
About 50 journalists and media experts gathered in downtown Belgrade to protest the measure.
Liljana Smajlovic, Serbian Association of Journalists president, described the legislation as both anti-European and unconstitutional.
Despite calls from journalists, President Boris Tadic signed it into law.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) is considering a partnership with the Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development (GERB), the most popular party in the country. 
UDF leader Plamen Yurukov's statement on Tuesday (December 18th) amounts to a policy shift, as the UDF has previously dismissed such co-operation.
Meanwhile, the party led by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), reportedly is preparing to replace members of a rebel faction within the party, beginning with deputy ministers. 
NDSV, part of the ruling coalition, has been steadily losing its members in parliament. 
The 16th, Petya Gegova, left on Monday.

TIRANA, Albania -- Police used excessive force against detainees following the January 21st events, when four people died and many were injured in an anti-government protest.
The violent behaviour of police forces was the subject of a confidential report by the Council of Europe's (CoE) Anti-torture Committee, quoted by local media Monday (May 2nd).
The detainees arrested during the protest were systematically beaten, the report says.
The document was compiled using testimony from a number of detainees who confirmed police violence committed individually or in groups.
They say those arrested were forced to sign prepared statements declaring them guilty of specific acts, without being given the right to speak to a lawyer or to family members.
The CoE committee wants concrete action taken, and wants an independent panel to investigate the violence, with measurable results within three months.

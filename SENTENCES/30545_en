ATHENS, Greece -- Greece will be paralysed again on Wednesday (December 15th) by a 24-hour general strike that will leave airports, ports, schools, shops, banks and public institutions closed.
Workers in the public and private sector held a three-hour work stoppage Tuesday to protest cost cutting measures that will lower their salaries as part of Greece's commitments under its 110 billion-euro bailout plan.
Wednesday's strike will also affect Thessaloniki, where thousands are expected to hold a large-scale demonstration later in the day.

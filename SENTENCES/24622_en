NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed on Thursday (March 5th) to set aside the thorny property issue after failing to reach an agreement.
At their meeting next week, the two will move on to EU-related matters, UN Special Representative Taye-Brook Zerihoun said.
"Property problems would be revisited at a later stage," Christofias said.
Thousands of fleeing Cypriots abandoned their property in 1974, as troops divided the island into Greek and Turkish halves.
In other news Thursday, the Church of Cyprus announced it would file a case with the European Court of Human Rights over the destruction of 522 Orthodox churches on the northern Turkish part of the island.
Turkey continues to desecrate churches by converting them to "morgues, stables and nightclubs", the Church said in a statement.
The Church also underscored the need to preserve Cyprus's religious and cultural heritage, much of which allegedly has suffered destruction since the 1974 Turkish invasion.

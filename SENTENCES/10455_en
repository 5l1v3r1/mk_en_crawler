BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Education Minister Ljiljana Colic resigned Thursday (16 September) following widespread outrage over her decision to suspend classes in Darwin's evolutionary theory. 
She said earlier this month that creationism should be considered on par with evolution. 
Colic also reportedly opposed foreign language and computer classes in schools. 
According to an official statement, she stepped down because opposition to her actions had started to affect the work of the entire government.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors will have another 15 trial days to wrap up their case against former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, a spokesman for the UN tribunal said Wednesday (14 January). 
The prosecution phase of the trial, which is well into its second year, must end on 17 February, barring unforeseen circumstances. 
The trial will then be adjourned for three months to give the defendant time to answer more than 60 charges of war crimes, including genocide. 
It is not clear yet how much time he would get in court, but the trial is expected to end sometime in 2005.

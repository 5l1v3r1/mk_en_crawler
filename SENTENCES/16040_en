BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Belgrade District Court on Monday (17 July) issued an international warrant for the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic's widow, Mira Markovic, after she failed to appear to face charges of abuse of power stemming from the distribution of apartments. 
The court also seized 15,000 euros that had been posted as bond. 
Markovic has been living in Russia since 2003. 
This is her fourth arrest warrant.

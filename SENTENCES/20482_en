BELGRADE, Serbia -- The US Embassy in Belgrade issued a statement on Monday (September 10th) aimed at clarifying recent remarks by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Volker, who said Washington would recognise unilaterally declared Kosovo independence if the UN Security Council fails to reach a consensus over final status.
"The United States seeks to secure a settlement on Kosovo's status that promotes peace and security for all people of the Balkans," the embassy said.
The statement reiterated Washington's commitment to the negotiations process and readiness to co-operate with all parties to reach a lasting solution.
It said the United States is prepared to accept any outcome to which the parties agree, but added that the ongoing talks are not open-ended.
Earlier, the Serbian government had protested Volker's comments, characterising them as an "open threat to Serbia's territorial integrity".

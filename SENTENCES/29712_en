BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament met another key condition Wednesday (May 25th) for Serbia's EU integration by adopting amendments to the law on elections, which also features abolishment of so-called blank resignations. 
In all, 119 lawmakers from the ruling coalition voted in favour of the amendments. 
Opposition representatives were not present during the vote. 
The new law ensures that when a lawmaker's mandate is terminated, he or she will be replaced by the next person in line on the electoral list. 
Previously, parliament members were required to deposit blank letters of resignation prior to assuming their seats, which allowed the party to replace them if they violated party policies or voted differently than the rest. 
The new measure is one of the main conditions for a positive opinion from the European Commission on granting EU candidate status to Serbia.

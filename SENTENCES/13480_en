SOFIA, Bulgaria -- At an extraordinary session Wednesday (23 November), the cabinet adopted its governing programme for the period 2005-2009.
Noting that the document was approved a day after the coalition government marked its first 100 days in office, local media commented that the programme focuses primarily on EU accession, while containing no specific targets in other areas, such as income growth and standards of living.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said the programme must be compared not to pre-election promises but with the political agreement reached among the three partners in the ruling coalition.
In other news Wednesday, Bulgarian Army chief General Nikola Kolev visited Beijing.
The focus of the trip was to discuss concrete ways to enhance bilateral defence and military ties.
Meanwhile a conference is under way in Sofia, aimed -- in part -- at addressing some budgetary restrictions anticipated for the military next year.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A total of 36 Macedonian parties signed a code for fair and democratic elections on Tuesday (13 June), vowing to prevent irregularities, violence or political pressure in the 5 July parliamentary vote.
In a statement for Dnevnik Tuesday, US Ambassador to Skopje Gillian Milovanovic warned that any election fraud would mean a betrayal of democracy and voters. 
The EU and NATO would carefully observe the election process and view it as a key test of the country's capacity to join Euro-Atlantic structures, she added.

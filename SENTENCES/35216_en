BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Greece will provide financial assistance to the Turkish Cypriots in the north of the island, Greek President Constantinos Stephanopoulos said during a visit to Azerbaijan on Monday (21 June).
"Because of the occupation they were unable to develop normally.
Now we will not spare any effort to support them financially," he said.
He also acknowledged the fact that the Turkish Cypriots now enjoy economic support from the international community.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The genocide trial against former Bosnian Serb officer Milorad Trbic opened on Thursday (November 8th) in BiH.
Trbic was assistant commander for security of the Bosnian Serb army's Zvornik Brigade in July 1995.
He is charged with personally killing 55 Muslims and supervising the execution of over 7,000 others after the UN-protected enclave fell to Serbian forces.
The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague referred the case to the BiH courts in June, signalling increased trust in the judiciary and its ability to prosecute war crimes.
This is the second trial in BiH related to Srebrenica.
Earlier this year, the court opened proceedings against 11 former members of the Republika Srpska Special Police Forces.
Also Thursday, BiH forensic experts said they completed exhumations at the Kamenica mass grave in Zvornik, north of Srebrenica.
They recovered 35 complete skeletons and 205 partial ones.

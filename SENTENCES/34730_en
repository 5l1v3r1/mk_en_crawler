THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A man who allegedly commanded guards at a Bosnian Serb camp in Foca during the 1992-1995 conflict surrendered to the international war crimes tribunal on Friday (15 August). 
Mitar Rasevic was in charge of 37 guards at the detention facility where more than 1,000 Muslim and Croat inmates were held in inhumane conditions during the war. 
According to the indictment, beatings and killings were common at the camp. 
Rasevic will face seven counts of crimes against humanity, five counts of violation of the laws and customs of war, and six counts of breaches of the Geneva Conventions. 
He is due to appear before the judges on Monday.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government adopted an extradition treaty with Montenegro on Friday (August 27th) covering those who have committed crimes punishable by more than three years in prison. 
"We informed Montenegro that we want to ratify this agreement as soon as possible," said Slobodan Homen, secretary of state of the justice ministry. 
"I believe that in the shortest possible deadline it will be concluded, as this is in the interest of both countries and the entire European integration [process]," he added. 
This deal differs somewhat with the one recently signed with Croatia. 
"Unlike the agreement with Croatia, which in its initial phase is limited to extradition for serious crimes -- in particular organised crime and corruption -- with Montenegro we have discussed and proposed a general agreement that should be applied to all crimes punishable by more than three years in prison," Homen said.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The impasse in the wake of parliamentary elections last weekend continued Tuesday (28 June) when the front-running Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) insisted on appointing the next prime minister.
BSP chairman Sergey Stanishev said his party would enter into a coalition only if it controls the next cabinet.
The National Movement Simeon II came in second on Saturday, according to final results announced Tuesday.
Senior officials from the party vowed they would not support any government that does not give incumbent Simeon Saxe-Coburg another term as prime minister.
The BSP can rely so far only on the support of the largely Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms.
Failure to form a cabinet would lead to the appointment of a caretaker cabinet and new elections in the autumn, just as Bulgaria races to complete reforms related to EU accession.

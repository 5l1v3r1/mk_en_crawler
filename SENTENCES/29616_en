BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet will decide on the adoption of the single currency by the end of April following discussions with the president and Central Bank representatives, Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Tuesday (April 26th). 
He added that Romania's convergence programme is not final and depends on cabinet approval. 
The comment came after local media obtained the draft convergence programme for 2011-2014, which did not include prospects for the 2015 euro adoption deadline. 
The document only mentions the 2013-2014 period as perspective for entering the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II). 
President Traian Basescu and some Central Bank officials previously hinted of a potential delay in the 2015 deadline, arguing that monetary policy needs further independence to control the effects of recession.

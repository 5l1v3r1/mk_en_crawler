NEW YORK, United States -- US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said Thursday (September 27th) that Washington would soon propose that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon initiate new talks aimed at reuniting Cyprus.
Burns made the statement after a meeting with Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
Papadopoulos is scheduled to meet with Ban on Sunday, while Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat will meet with the secretary-general next month.
In other news, Matthew Nimitz, the UN special envoy trying to resolve the longstanding name dispute between Greece and Macedonia, said on Thursday that he plans to restart UN-mediated negotiations next month.
Unlike previous talks, the new negotiations will held at the government level, rather than at the ambassadorial level.
Greece opposes use of the name Macedonia, saying it implies claims on the northern Greek province of the same name.

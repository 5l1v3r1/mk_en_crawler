The HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Judge Patrick Robinson of Jamaica and his panel will now oversee the preparatory phase of the trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, The Hague war crimes tribunal announced on Thursday (August 21st). 
Tribunal Chairman Fausto Pocar said in a written statement that initially Judge Alphonse Orie was to preside, but that he made the change because of a possible link between Karadzic's trial and that of Momcilo Krajisnik, which Orie's panel also conducted. 
On Tuesday, Karadzic requested the tribunal appoint a new judge, claiming Orie would be biased because he had sentenced Krajisnik, one of Karadzic's closest former allies. 
Karadzic's next scheduled court appearance occurs in a week. 
Police arrested him last month.

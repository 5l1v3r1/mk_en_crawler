ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor met on Sunday (May 8th) with Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic to discuss the latest details in a report on judicial reforms. 
The government is to adopt the document Thursday. 
Kosor said she expects that the report will receive a positive assessment from the European Commission (EC). 
The judiciary chapter is among the most problematic in Croatia's accession talks; authorities have to prove they have undertaken serious reforms in the sector to meet the benchmarks for closing the chapter. 
Croatia still hopes to end its EU negotiations by late June.

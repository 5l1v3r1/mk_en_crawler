BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosniak representatives in the Republika Srpska (RS) Council of Peoples vetoed on Monday (February 22nd) a law on referendums passed by parliament on February 10th. 
Edin Ramic, chairman of the Bosniak caucus in the RS parliament, said that Bosniak representatives insist on several amendments. 
He said the legislation should precisely say that questions to be asked must be in accordance with the RS powers, RS Constitution and BiH's Constitution. 
Bosniaks also insist on a provision guaranteeing that BiH's territorial integrity, sovereignty and security cannot be subject to referendums. 
RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic said the Bosniaks' move is no surprise, as they threatened to veto the law even before it was drafted.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The process of decentralising responsibilities and resources of a number of government offices began on Friday (1 July). 
The government's plan envisions the transfer of 489 institutions -- along with around 27,000 employees, 400,000 square metres of office space and 2.5m square metres of land -- from central to local governments. 
The decentralisation will include the education, social security and culture sectors, as well as the operation of fire brigades.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ferran Tarradellas, spokesman for EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs, dismissed on Friday (November 3rd) the possibility of extending the decommissioning deadlines for units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant.
In a statement for Bulgarian National Radio, Tarradellas stressed that the country had made a firm pre-accession commitment to close down the two older reactors by December 31st.
Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov warned earlier last week of a possible energy crisis in the Balkans when the two units are shut down.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The US Embassy in Ankara issued a statement Monday (17 April) denying a report that Washington is trying to establish new bases in Turkey. 
"A front-page article in today's Cumhuriyet claims that the United States is seeking to set up three naval bases on Turkey's Mediterranean and Aegean coasts. 
This story is unfounded. 
The United States is not seeking to establish any such military bases in Turkey," the statement said.

TIRANA, Albania -- The office of the European Commission (EC) in Albania praised on Tuesday (April 22nd) the level of consensus reached by the two biggest political parties.
EC Ambassador Helmut Lohan referred to approval Monday of amendments to the constitution, largely in the area of electoral reform.
Parliament approved the amendments overwhelmingly, following general agreement by the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party.
Representatives of smaller parties had complained to the EC delegation that the larger parties were ignoring their suggestions.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Sunday (March 11th) that representatives of the RS government will not participate in a key meeting in Srebrenica. 
Muslim returnees are threatening to leave the town by Wednesday if the international community and local authorities do not give it special status. 
The returnees blame Dodik for their poverty and insist they do not want to be citizens of an entity that has committed genocide. 
Dodik rejects the accusations and says they threaten BiH's constitutional order. 
He also warned that if High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling attends the meeting, RS would consider it an attempt to undermine the Dayton Peace Accord.

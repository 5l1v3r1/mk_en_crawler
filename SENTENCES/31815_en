BUCHAREST, Romania -- Representatives of the government and the trade unions sealed an agreement Wednesday (2 April) on severance pay for companies undergoing bankruptcy and liquidation procedures. 
The government will offer compensation equal to 24 months pay for jobs lost due to downsizing programmes in the industrial zones of Brasov. 
According to a timetable hammered out with the IMF, money-losing companies in the region would cut some 20,000 jobs over the span of several months.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided on Wednesday (26 October) to take additional financial measures against terrorism, as evidence of its commitment to the global anti-terror coalition.
Among other steps, it has moved to freeze the assets of individuals appearing on international lists of terrorists and financial supporters of terrorism.
They include Abdul Latif Saleh, a Jordanian with Albanian citizenship who the Security Council has cited as a terrorist financier.
A week ago, authorities froze the accounts of Saudi Yassin Kadi, who appears on the US State Department's terrorist watch list.

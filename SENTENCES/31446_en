BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government announced Sunday (26 January) that it has decided to build the controversial Dracula theme park near the capital rather than in Transylvania, as originally planned. 
A tourism ministry spokesman says PriceWaterhouseCoopers suggested the change of location in a recent feasibility study. 
According to the US firm, a park in Dracula's native Transylvania could only attract about 600,000 visitors per year, whereas the same facility could be visited by more than one million if it is built near Bucharest.

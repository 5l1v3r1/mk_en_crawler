ANKARA, Turkey -- Kurdish activist Leyla Zana told tens of thousands of supporters in Diyarbakir on Sunday (13 June) that Kurdish separatists should reinstate the truce they had observed for five years. 
She urged the armed groups of the Kurdistan People's Congress to refrain from violence. 
Zana was one of four Kurdish lawmakers who were released from prison last week. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that he was prepared to meet with her.

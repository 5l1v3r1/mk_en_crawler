BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece cannot deal with the influx of illegal migrants entering the country through the border with Turkey on its own, the European border security agency FRONTEX said in a report quoted by local media Sunday (January 9th). 
According to the document, a record 31,000 immigrants, mostly from Afghanistan and Algeria, were detected attempting to cross into Greece from Turkey between January and September 2010. 
This number could be much larger, it warned. 
The scope of the problem prompted Greece to request help a few months ago. 
In response, FRONTEX deployed a rapid intervention team.
In other news Sunday, police detained a group of 15 Afghan migrants who were about to board two private planes bound for Italy. 
Six suspected traffickers were also detained, including a British national and a Moroccan woman who worked for a travel agency in Milan. 
Police say she secured fake documents for the Afghans and charged each of them 1,000 euros.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) plans to discuss the need for constitutional reform in BiH, during its session in Strasbourg. 
Debate will focus on amending the country's constitution in light of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in December that the constitution discriminates against minorities. 
The PACE debate comes a week after Micheline Calmy-Rey visited Sarajevo. 
She is chairwoman of the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers.

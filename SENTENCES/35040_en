ISTANBUL, Turkey -- EU leaders attending the NATO summit in Istanbul sent out messages Monday (28 June) in support of Turkey's EU membership bid.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder noted the country has met the conditions for opening accession talks.
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister Tony Blair were also supportive.
French President Jacques Chirac said that if the progress report to be prepared about Turkey were positive, the EU would start accession talks.
In other developments, the Turkish Parliament's Justice Commission approved on Monday the EU harmonisation package that amends certain laws, bringing them into line with the latest constitutional changes.
Among other things, the package would replace the death penalty with life imprisonment, and would remove members of the military from the Education Board.

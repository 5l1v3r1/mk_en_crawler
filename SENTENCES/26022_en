BUCHAREST, Romania -- The city of Timisoara marked the 20th anniversary of the fall of the communist regime on Wednesday (December 16th). 
Timisoara is regarded as the birthplace of the revolution that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu on December 16th 1989. 
Conferences, religious services and other events were held in the city to honour the fighters who took the city 20 years ago. 
Around 100 people were killed in Timisoara in 1989, when the army opened fire against demonstrators, at Ceausescu's orders. 
At a gathering Wednesday, Timisoara Mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandru said the city should be proud the revolution began there, adding. 
"To those who were born free, I say that things were changed in this revolution." (BBC, AP - 16/12/09)

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski rejected on Monday (June 28th) opposition calls for early elections, while acknowledging that each party has the legitimate right to seek a snap vote. 
As for the name row with Greece, Gruevski said there are no indications that UN mediator Matthew Nimetz will offer a new proposal any time soon. 
Asked whether a solution is possible before NATO's November summit, Gruevski said "It is probably possible, only if there is will, understanding and respect by the other side for what is considered state and national interest." Main opposition party SDSM is calling for early elections, but only after the summit, so as to not affect NATO aspirations.

TIRANA, Albania -- Elections for mayors and municipal councillors in 17 out of 382 districts will have to be repeated, according to an announcement Saturday (March 31st) from the Central Election Commission.
Officials say it has taken this long to assess all the complaints filed since the February 18th local elections, described as the most difficult in 17 years.
Political parties were urged to immediately resume dialogue on sorely needed electoral reform.

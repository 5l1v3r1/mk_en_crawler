BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's new EU Integration Minister, Anca Boagiu, spoke to the local media Thursday (15 September) about her first trip to Brussels.
During meetings with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Director General of the Enlargement Directorate General Fabrizio Barbaso, Boagiu was told that a difficult period for Romania has begun, she said.
EU officials made clear that if the country does not implement necessary reforms, the EC might recommend delay of the accession process in a progress report due in April 2006.
Also Thursday, Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu signed a decision to sack eight state secretaries whose work related to EU integration was unsatisfactory.
He indicated more personnel changes would follow.
In other news, Bucharest is hosting a two-day international seminar on human trafficking in Southeast Europe.
The OSCE is participating, as are representatives of NGOs and public institutions from Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro.

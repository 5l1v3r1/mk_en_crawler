BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The United States could cut part of its assistance to Serbia if Ratko Mladic remains at large, US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said on Wednesday (10 May).
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to assess the level of Serbia's co-operation with the UN tribunal later this month, which could affect some aid.
Polt also told reporters that Serbia-Montenegro would be unable to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme until the Bosnian Serb general is arrested.
In other news, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Mladic's arrest is the government's top priority.
He noted that authorities must find the fugitive if they want to fulfil their other main priority, eventual membership in the EU.

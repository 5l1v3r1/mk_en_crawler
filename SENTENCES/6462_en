This year's Exit Festival offered fans what they have come to expect: top acts from around the world and the region, and an atmosphere of youthful energy.
Among the internationally renowned performers headlining the event were British rapper M.I.A., LA punk rockers Bad Religion, the indie group Arcade Fire, and DJs such as James Zabeila and DJ Tiga.
Megastar Jamiroquai thrilled the Saturday night crowd with her 1996 hit "Cosmic Girl". 
Fans also thrilled to the sounds of Mashrouh Leila, Fari Bradley, Girl Unit, Ben UFO and Cinnamon Chasers.
Closer to home, the Slovenian band Laibach put on a spectacular show, while the girls from Marsheaux – a band based in Thessaloniki – mesmerized fans with synthpop mix.
The festival, now in its 12th year, closed on Monday (July 11th).

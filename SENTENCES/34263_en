SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Officials said Wednesday (2 July) that relations with the United States remain strong despite the suspension of military aid to Sofia.
Washington suspended military aid to 35 countries, including Bulgaria, which have not signed agreements on immunity from prosecution by the International Criminal Court.
Foreign Minister Solomon Passy downplayed the impact, as did government spokesman Dimitar Tsonev, who said ties between Sofia and Washington have never been better.

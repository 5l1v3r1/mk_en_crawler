BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (May 30th) that the European Commission would discuss the possibility of resuming negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia in the coming weeks. 
But the decision could depend on an assessment UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will be making. 
She is scheduled to visit Serbia on Monday. 
Negotiations on the SAA were frozen more than a year ago due to Serbia's lack of co-operation with the UN tribunal.

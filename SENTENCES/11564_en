ATHENS, Greece -- The 15,800 tonne Greek cruise liner Ocean Monarch sailed Friday (21 January) carrying 630 tonnes of aid to Sri Lanka. 
Once it has delivered the aid, the vessel will remain docked at Trincomalee to serve as a hospital. 
There are six medical units aboard -- surgery, pathology, gynaecology, paediatrics, radiology and microbiology -- as well as a pharmacy. 
Each unit will be manned by two doctors, and will provide services 12 hours a day. 
Twenty-five nurses have also been dispatched on the mission.

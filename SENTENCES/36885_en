BUCHAREST, Romania -- During a roundtable Wednesday (7 July), diplomatic representatives from the EU and the United States called for more efforts to guarantee media freedom in Romania. 
The diplomats urged authorities to take steps aimed at removing political and business pressure on local media, as part of the country's EU accession bid. 
Romania's new penal code does not include jail sentences for journalists convicted of libel, but does stipulate hefty fines.

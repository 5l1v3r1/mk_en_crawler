BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia has asked the Cyprus government for access to confidential information about the banking accounts of the son and wife of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, The Cyprus Mail reported on Saturday (July 28th).
Marko and Mira Milosevic, who fled Serbia in 2001 and are believed to be hiding in parts of the former Soviet Union, are accused of laundering millions of Cyprus Pounds from illegal cigarette smuggling through Cyprus.
In a report published last month, the Serbian daily Blic claimed a huge amount of cash obtained by Marko Milosevic had been transferred to Cyprus via airplane.

TIRANA, Albania -- Police arrested five people, including two officials, for suspected corruption Tuesday (December 22nd). 
Procurement Office director Bujar Murati, a prosecution expert at the State Guard, and three administrators in a private company are accused of violating a public tender procedure to provide police and guard uniforms. 
Prosecutors say the group rigged the contract by eliminating competition. 
Each of the officials allegedly received a bribe of up to 125,000 euros.

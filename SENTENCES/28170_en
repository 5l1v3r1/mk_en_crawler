THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic resumed on Tuesday (August 17th) with testimony from former UN senior military observer Richard Mole, who discussed the siege of Sarajevo.
Mole told the court that in autumn 1992, the Bosnian Serb Army shelled the city virtually every day.
He said residents lived in constant fear and that about 15 people were killed a day.
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government plans to ask parliament to work beyond 1 July, the date it usually goes into recess, Turkish Justice Minister and government spokesman Cemil Cicek said on Monday (7 June).
The extension would provide a chance to enact some draft laws important to the EU's Progress Report on Turkey, moving domestic legislation closer to the Copenhagen political criteria for EU membership.
Also Monday, a senior Turkish prosecutor asked an appeals court to overturn the 15-year sentence given Kurdish activist Leyla Zana.
In 1991, she became the first Kurdish woman to win a seat in parliament.
The EU has been calling for her release.

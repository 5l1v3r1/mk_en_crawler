SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Party of Democratic Progress (PDP), the junior government ally in Republika Srpska (RS), said on Thursday (January 31st) it is not certain it will attend talks Saturday on constitutional changes. 
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak is organising the session in Siroki Brijeg. 
PDP leader Mladen Ivanic explained that his party does not want to participate in the negotiations since its status in the present state-level parliamentary majority is not defined, due to somewhat strained relations with the ruling SNSD. 
Still, Ivanic said talks between the PDP and the SNSD are under way and their outcome could lead the PDP reconsider its decision.

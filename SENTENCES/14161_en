BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- National Bank of Serbia (NBS) Governor Radovan Jelasic has rejected allegations by the ex-chief of the bankrupt bank KEB, Sekula Pjevcevic, who said top NBS management had demanded a 2m-euro bribe in exchange for returning KEB's revoked license. 
Speaking on Saturday (14 January), Jelasic said the charges were an attempt to destabilise the Serbian banking system, and that NBS would press libel charges. 
The controversy follows last week's arrest of NBS vice governor Dejan Simic on suspicion of taking a 100,000-euro bribe in return for intervening in favour of KEB. 
Pjevcevic says Simic was not the only top official involved.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Three former senior military officials testified Saturday (December 5th) about an alleged army plot to topple the government of the Justice and Development Party.
Former Army head Aytac Yalman, Air Force head Ibrahim Firtina and Navy chief Ozden Ornek spent several hours with prosecutors in Istanbul, discussing the so-called Ergenekon network, a secularist group suspected of planning to cause chaos that would eventually bring down the government.
Local media has published parts of Ornek's diaries that purportedly gave details of the plot.
Deputy Prosecutor General Turan Colakkadi said questioning focused on those diaries.

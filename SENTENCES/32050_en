SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria may submit an application to host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, according to Minister of Sport Vasil Ivanov. 
An organisational committee has been formed, headed by astronaut Alexander Alexandrov. 
Bulgaria has tried twice before, first in 1992 and then in 1994, when it lost in the last round. 
Preparations for this third application will start next week, with the arrival of representatives from the Swiss consulting firm that advised Bulgaria during the previous attempts.

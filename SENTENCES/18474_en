BELGRADE, Serbia -- The outgoing government drafted a new resolution regarding Kosovo on Tuesday (February 13th), in light of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's Kosovo status settlement proposal and upcoming negotiations. 
Cabinet spokesman Srdjan Djuric says the resolution results from an agreement by the majority of parties in parliament. 
The draft reads that Ahtisaari's proposal breaches the basic principles of international law, does not mention the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia in relation to Kosovo, and gives Kosovo the attributes of a sovereign state. 
Debate on it was expected Wednesday, during the new parliament's constituent session.
Lawmakers are also to appoint members of the delegation to attend talks on Kosovo in Vienna next week. 
Meanwhile, the Serbian National Council, an organisation representing Kosovo's Serbs, denounced Ahtisaari's plan as "absolutely unacceptable" Tuesday.

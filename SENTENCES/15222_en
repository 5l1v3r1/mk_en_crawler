SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A new poll by the Institute for Democracy in Macedonia suggests that many voters remain undecided ahead of the 5 July parliamentary elections.
Some 42.2 per cent said they do not know which party they will support, up nearly 5 per cent from last month's poll.
Institute chief Vladimir Misa says that may be due to repeated incidents marring the pre-election campaign.
According to the poll, the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE leads political parties with 17.3 per cent, followed by the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia with 12.8 per cent, and the main ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration, currently a junior partner in the ruling coalition, with 9.6 per cent.
Results were released Wednesday (28 June).

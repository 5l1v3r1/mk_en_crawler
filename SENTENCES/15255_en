ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic visited Croatia on Tuesday (27 June) for talks with counterpart Stipe Mesic on strengthening bilateral ties. 
The Serbian leader expressed strong support for Zagreb's EU and NATO membership bids. 
Croatia's accession, he said, would make it easier for other countries to join these international alliances.
Tadic also urged the Croatian government to do more to encourage the return of Serb refugees. 
About 140,000 of 300,000 Serb refugees have returned to their homes in Croatia since the end of the 1991-1995 conflict. 
On Wednesday, Tadic was due in Skopje, the next stop on his regional tour.

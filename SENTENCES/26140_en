SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Zoran Jolevski, Macedonia's representative in the ongoing efforts to resolve the long-standing name dispute with Greece, said on Sunday (August 16th) that Skopje plans to respond this week to UN mediator Matthew Nimetz's latest proposal.
Nimetz submitted the plan last month during visits to Skopje and Athens.
Details of the initiative were not revealed, but Nimetz is believed to have proposed the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia" for international use.
Citing diplomatic sources, the Greek daily Kathimerini reported on Friday that both Skopje and Athens back the idea.
Separately on Sunday, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis urged Macedonian counterpart Nikola Gruevski and his government to end their "nationalist" rhetoric, as it doesn't help resolve the problem.
The dispute has affected Macedonia's EU and NATO prospects.

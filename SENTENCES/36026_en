SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski praised the work of the special operations unit known as the "Wolves". 
During a ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of the unit's establishment, he described the Wolves as the "the most elite, most professional and most mobile unit ever in Macedonia", and said it meets the need for a "light and flexible, but strategically deployed and mobile armed force, which will also be used for operations beyond the Macedonian borders".

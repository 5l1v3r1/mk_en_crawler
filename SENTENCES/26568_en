TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE mission in Albania and the US Embassy in Tirana welcomed President Bamir Topi's initiative to organise negotiations between the government and the opposition in order to end an ongoing political stalemate. 
The opposition has been boycotting parliament since September, insisting on a thorough investigation into the June 2009 general elections, which they maintain were manipulated. 
In a statement Wednesday (February 10th), the OSCE praised Saturday's scheduled talks as constructive. 
The US Embassy says the process offers an important opportunity to solve the current problems, which have impeded passage of EU-related reforms.

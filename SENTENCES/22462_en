TIRANA, Albania -- Prosecutors on Wednesday (September 10th) began questioning former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu regarding the March 15th explosions at the Gerdec ammunitions depot. 
During the questioning, Mediu denied responsibility for the incident and accused the army of building the depot in an inhabited area, media reported. 
He also said troops failed to employ appropriate safety measures. 
Parliament stripped Mediu of his immunity in June. 
The explosions in Gerdec killed 26 people and injured 300.

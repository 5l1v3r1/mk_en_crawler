WASHINGTON, United States -- Frank Wisner, US special envoy for Kosovo, said Thursday (October 4th) that the province's final status may not be determined this year after all, because time is running out. 
The only firm date at this point is the December 10th deadline by which the Kosovo troika would have to submit its report regarding negations between Belgrade and Pristina to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
"I wouldn't rule out that there are going to have to be some discussions at the UN," Wisner said, suggesting the process could run into 2008.
Thursday in Paris, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn criticised Russia for threatening to veto a UN Security Council move to grant independence to Kosovo. 
"We urge our partners in the international community to adopt a responsible position favouring a negotiable solution," Rehn said in speech to French students.

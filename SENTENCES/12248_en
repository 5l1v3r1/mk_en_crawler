BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A two-day seminar on the implementation of the 1995 Dayton Agreement over the past decade wrapped up in Republika Srpska on Friday (13 May).
More than 130 experts from BiH, Russia, Serbia and international organisations attended.
RS President Dragan Cavic characterised Dayton as the best peace agreement of the 20th century and said it should be preserved.
In other news, NATO, EUFOR and the Office of the High Representative issued a joint statement Thursday, criticising actions announced by RS Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic in response to the behaviour of RS Army conscripts during their oath taking ceremonies last month.
The statement described the measures as completely inadequate.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia can receive EU candidate status by year's end, EP Rapporteur for the country, Jelko Kacin, said on Saturday (May 21st). 
Yet the most important condition remains: the extradition of the two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, to The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
The country also needs to implement further reforms in the public sector, Kacin added. 
Serbia could potentially start accession talks next spring, he predicted.

ATHENS, Greece -- A bomb exploded on Petrou Ralli Avenue in central Athens on Friday (29 October), targeting several police buses, according to a police statement.
No casualties were reported.
Authorities suggest the attack might have been in response to convictions returned earlier this month against 19 members of the radical leftist groups Revolutionary Popular Struggle and 17 November.

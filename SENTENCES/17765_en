BELGRADE, Serbia -- New Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic will be in charge of Serbia's EU integration process and co-operation with international financial institutions, according to a government announcement Friday (May 18th). 
Djelic, who was finance minister in the late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's cabinet, also will be responsible for co-ordinating the work of ministries with organisations in the field of finance and economy. 
Djelic said in an interview that re-launching Serbia's frozen Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU depends on the country's ability to convince the Union that it is doing everything in its power to locate, arrest and extradite fugitives wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal.

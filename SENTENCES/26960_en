BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia finally resumed its EU accession process, blocked by Slovenia since the end of 2008, by opening six and closing five negotiation chapters at an intergovernmental conference Friday (October 2nd).
Thus, 28 chapters are now open and 12 are closed.
Croatia expects to open all 33 negotiation chapters of its acquis by the end of the year and close at least 20 of them.
Sweden, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, plans to call two more conferences with Croatia by the end of this year.
Slovenia had blocked progress over a longstanding maritime border dispute with Croatia that was recently resolved.

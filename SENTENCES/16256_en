HELSINKI, Finland -- Serbian President Boris Tadic asked the international community on Friday (October 13th) to delay the decision on the future status of Kosovo until after Serbia holds elections. 
"I'm not asking to delay the process, I'm asking for rationality," he explained. 
He suggested the issue could play into the hands of radical political formations in Serbia. 
The EU foreign ministers are to examine progress in the Kosovo talks at a two-day meeting that begins on Monday

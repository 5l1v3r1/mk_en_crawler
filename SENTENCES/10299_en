BUCHAREST, Romania -- A poll conducted Thursday (25 November) suggests the ruling Social Democrats and their coalition partners will likely win Sunday's general elections by a 6 per cent margin.
The coalition, headed by Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, is drawing about 39 per cent of voter support, compared to 33 per cent for the opposition alliance.
A minority party, the Hungarian Democratic Union, is projected to win 5 per cent.
It has supported the Social Democrat-led government during its current term.
The poll also showed Nastase leading in the presidential race with 40 per cent, compared to 30 per cent for his chief rival, Traian Basescu.

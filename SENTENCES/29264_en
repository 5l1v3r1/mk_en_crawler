LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Lawmakers voted unanimously Monday (May 3rd) to hold a referendum on the arbitration border agreement with Croatia on June 6th. 
Slovenians will be asked whether they back the law on ratification of the arbitration agreement between the two neighbours. 
Parliament members ratified the document in April, months after Croatian lawmakers. 
The Slovenian government is obligated to comply with the results of the referendum. 
Under the agreement, the maritime border dispute will be subject to international arbitration.

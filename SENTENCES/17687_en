BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for resolving the Kosovo status issue will be presented to the UN Security Council in New York Monday (March 26th). 
The envoy himself will not attend the closed-door session. 
Ahtisaari's spokesman, Remi Dourlot, said the draft also would be forwarded to the EU and NATO.
On Sunday, the Serb National Council of Kosovo and Metohija urged the international community and the UN to reject the plan. 
It called for the continuation of the Belgrade-Pristina negotiations on Kosovo's status, and warned that the security situation for Serbs in Kosovo is deteriorating.

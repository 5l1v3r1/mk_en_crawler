BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis met on Wednesday (9 April) in Belgrade to discuss prospects for unification of Cyprus.
Both officials underlined their commitment to resolving the issue, but no significant progress was made.
Simitis repeated the Greek position that unification of the island should be achieved within the framework proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
It envisions a Swiss-style federation.
Erdogan, however, says some changes must be made for the proposal to become a basis for negotiations.

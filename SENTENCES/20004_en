BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) will re-examine its relations with the other senior ruling coalition partner, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party (DSS), if the DSS decides to boycott next month's presidential elections, DS whip Nada Kolundzija said on Tuesday (December 18th). 
She said she hopes responsibility and reason will prevail. 
The DSS and its ally, the New Serbia Party, insist elections should be held well after Kosovo's status issue is resolved. 
Currently, the elections are scheduled for January 20th.

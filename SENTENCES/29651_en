PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Courts across Kosovo have a backlog of about 300,000 cases, local media reported on Sunday (January 30th), based on official sources. 
Enver Peci, chairman of the Kosovo Judicial Council, said the justice system is adopting measures to deal with the situation, which he described as "extraordinary". 
"We hope that the results will begin to be seen this year," Peci said.
University Professor Riza Smaka, meanwhile, described the situation as alarming and argued the judicial system is facing collapse. 
"It is a very disturbing, I emphasise, very disturbing circumstance. 
The judiciary for the time being is miserable, it has collapsed ... 
people have no confidence," Smaka warned. 
EULEX has moved to help local prosecutors by dealing with more difficult cases, including war crimes and corruption.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ali Ahmeti, leader of the main ethnic Albanian party in Macedonia, the Democratic Union for Integration, began a visit to Pristina on Tuesday (2 May) focusing on border demarcation and other regional issues.
Following talks with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Parliament Speaker Kole Berisha, Ahmeti said he views border demarcation as a technical issue, to be addressed in bilateral discussions.
It should not represent an obstacle to developing ties between Skopje and Pristina, he said.

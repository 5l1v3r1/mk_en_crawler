BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission is set to abolish visa requirements for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania, but at the same time, will introduce a monitoring mechanism for implementing a visa-free regime for all Western Balkan countries. 
This is as required by the Netherlands and some other EU member states, the Belgrade-based Beta news agency reported on Thursday (November 4th), quoting sources in Brussels. 
The EU interior ministers are expected to approve lifting visa requirements for the two countries on Monday, which would take effect in late December. 
BiH and Albania missed the first wave of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans -- in which Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro were included in the so-called White Schengen list -- as of late December 2009.

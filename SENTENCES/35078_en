TIRANA, Albania -- Representatives of the opposition Democratic Party walked out of Thursday's (29 April) parliament session to protest the exclusion of a measure to compensate those who had been politically persecuted in the past. 
Lawmakers only voted on their two-week agenda after it became clear the controversial compensation bill was not in it.

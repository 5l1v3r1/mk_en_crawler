SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku was due to arrive in Skopje on Friday (5 May), at the head of a business delegation that includes Minister of Trade and Industry Ali Jakupi and representatives of the Kosovo Industrial Chamber. 
His agenda includes a meeting with counterpart Vlado Buckovski and leaders of the opposition parties in parliament. 
The daylong visit was expected to focus mainly on economic co-operation and trade, and possibly also the issue of border demarcation. 
Bilateral relations grew strained recently following a comment Ceku made regarding a demarcation agreement signed between Serbia-Montenegro and Macedonia.

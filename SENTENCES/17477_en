BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic says Serbia does not rely on Russia alone in opposing the "forced" partition of Serbia's territorial integrity, in other words, Kosovo's independence. 
In an interview in Monday's (February 26th) edition of Blic, Draskovic says a number of European countries -- Spain, Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Italy and Poland -- have indicated reservations about declaring Kosovo independent against Serbia's will. 
He added that he hoped Brussels and Washington realised that "partition" of Serbia would result in "national shock".
In other news Sunday, G17 Plus leader Mladjan Dinkic called for the launch of "serious" talks on forming a new Serbian government as soon as possible. 
He warned that further postponement would harm the state and may result in more elections. 
The last ones were held weeks ago.

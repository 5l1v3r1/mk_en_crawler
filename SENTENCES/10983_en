DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Four policemen have been indicted over the killing of a 12-year-old boy and his father, Turkish authorities said Wednesday (29 December). 
The two were killed outside their home in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of the country in late November. 
Police say they were shot during an operation against KONGRA-GEL terrorists, but local rights activists and neighbours said the victims were unarmed civilians. 
The government's handling of the incident is being seen as a test of Turkey's progress as it prepares for membership talks with the EU.
In other news Wednesday, Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed a joint statement on the construction of the Kars-Akhalkalaki-Tbilisi railway. 
It will cost an estimated $350m to build.

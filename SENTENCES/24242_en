ATHENS, Greece -- PASOK leader George Papandreou called again on Sunday (December 14th) for Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to resign over the wave of riots triggered by the death of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer on December 6th. 
Papandreou told a PASOK meeting that the government is to blame for the crisis and is incapable of driving the country towards change. 
Karamanlis says he has no intention of quitting and has ruled out early elections.
The situation is generally calm Monday. 
But on Sunday, demonstrators firebombed several banks and police stations. 
Protesters also clashed with police in the capital, while the Athens City local government radio station was taken over for a few hours by student protesters. 
Demonstrations in solidarity continued in several cities Sunday, including London, Moscow, Paris, Berlin, Melbourne and Skopje.

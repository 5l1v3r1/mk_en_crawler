ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt has paid 1,700 euros out of her own pocket to keep a journalist from going to jail. 
Miroslav Juric, editor-in-chief of the now defunct Novi Brodski List, refused to pay the fine after he was sentenced for libel and chose to serve a 70-day jail term instead. 
He appeared at the prison on Monday (19 July) only to be told to go home. 
"I simply do not want journalists to go to jail while I'm justice minister," Skare-Ozbolt told a local radio station.

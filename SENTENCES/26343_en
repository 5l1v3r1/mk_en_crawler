TIRANA, Albania -- A court in Tirana on Tuesday (January 12th) sentenced two Britons to a total of 35 years in prison for sexually molesting children at an orphanage.
After a two-year process, the court found Dino Christodoulou and Robin Arnold guilty and sentenced them to 20 and 15.5 years respectively.
The trial started in 2005 when the two volunteers at the His Children Orphanage were reported for abuse of children aged 6, 7 and 9.
In 2008, a court sentenced John David Brown, to 20 years in prison based on the same charges.
The orphanage has since closed.

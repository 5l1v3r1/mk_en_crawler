ZAGREB, Croatia -- Speaking with local economists, President Stipe Mesic said Thursday (30 June) that Croatia needs a new national economic development plan, drafted on the basis of national consensus, and supported by all parties in parliament.
He implied that the current economic policy is not bringing the desired results and stressed that a new plan should include measures to boost exports, reduce unemployment and increase productivity.
Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec said the government is working on such a plan and that it would be ready by year's end.

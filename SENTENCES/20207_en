ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish military planes launched air strikes against positions of the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq early Sunday (December 16th). 
The planes hit the regions of Zap, Hakurk and Avasin, as well as a region in the Qandil Mountain, which is believed to be the stronghold of the Kurdish militants, the Turkish Army said. 
The attack marks Turkey's first major operation against the PKK guerrillas on Iraqi territory. 
Following the air strikes, the army continued to shell targets in northern Iraq using long-range artillery.
Iraqi officials claimed that ten villages were bombed and a woman was killed in the raids. 
Two people were reported injured. 
The Turkish General Staff said the attacks targeted PKK guerrillas and facilities and were not directed against the civilian population in the area. 
Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said the army will continue to carry out operations whenever necessary, and renewed the government's recent calls on the guerrillas to lay down their arms.

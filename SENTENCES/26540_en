TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE Ambassador to Tirana Robert Bosch says corruption in Albania is worrying and is a barrier to EU integration. 
Speaking at a conference organised by the OSCE on Wednesday (December 9th), Bosch said that corruption has spread into many sectors, adding the lack of transparency is evident, especially in terms of political party financing. 
"Although the Electoral Code requires that the Central Election Commission collects political party financial declarations, it lacks the proper tools to investigate the funding sources, and there is also no reporting obligation for private sector donations," said Bosch. 
"Corruption lowers tax revenues, inflating the costs of public services, distorting private sector competition and, in its ugliest manifestation, condemning vulnerable groups to poverty," he added.

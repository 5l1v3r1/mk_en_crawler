BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) signed a protocol Friday (July 3rd) on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
This addition to an existing agreement on inspections of nuclear facilities was signed by visiting IAEA Director General Mohamed El Baradei and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic. 
"This protocol demonstrates that the international community can count on Serbia in the fight against terrorism and against nuclear proliferation," the two officials said in a joint statement. 
Djelic said that once parliament ratifies the protocol, the IAEA will conduct detailed inspections across the country.

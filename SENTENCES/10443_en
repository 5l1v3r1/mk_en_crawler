ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged France on Tuesday (19 October) to back his country's bid for EU membership.
Speaking to reporters before his departure for Paris, Erdogan praised France for helping Turkey on numerous important occasions.
"I believe France will not withhold its traditional support on the issue of taking a decision to start membership talks," he said, referring to an EU summit on 17 December, which is widely expected to give the green light for launching accession talks.
Also Tuesday, Germany and Portugal expressed support for starting the talks.
Erdogan and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul have made clear that Ankara expects nothing less than full membership, amid persistent talk of giving Turkey a special membership status.

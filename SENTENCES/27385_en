BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade accepted a plea bargain Wednesday (September 29th) under which student Miladin Kovacevic will serve two years and three months in prison for beating a fellow undergrad at a university he attended in the United States.
Kovacevic pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this month.
The former Serb basketball player was accused of inflicting "severe bodily harm with possible deadly consequences", stemming from an assault on Bryan Steinhauer, 22, of Brooklyn, New York.
The court said Steinhauer, who suffered brain damage, has eight days to appeal the decision.

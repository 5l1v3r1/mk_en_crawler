ANKARA, Turkey -- Economy Minister and chief negotiator with the EU, Ali Babacan, predicted at the weekend that Turkey would be ready for Union accession by 2011. 
In light of the EU decision to partially freeze talks with Ankara over issues related to Cyprus, Babacan said Turkey has decided set its own timetable to implement the necessary reforms in all chapters of the acquis. 
He anticipates this timetable to be hammered out by April, at the latest. 
He stressed that in doing so, Ankara will be ready for the launch of negotiations in all chapters whenever the EU is ready for Turkey.

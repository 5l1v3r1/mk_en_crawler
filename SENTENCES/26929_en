SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The political situation in BiH is deteriorating with no signs of improvement, High Representative Valentin Inzko told visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday (November 5th). 
Inzko stressed that the tasks the country faces include fully implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement, ensuring functionality of the state, and guaranteeing the transition of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) into the Office of the EU's Special Representative. 
Lavrov reaffirmed that Russia supports the OHR's transformation. 
In Sarajevo, he met with Bosnian counterpart Sven Alkalaj, later saying that conditions set by the Peace Implementation Council for closing the OHR are clear and should be met.

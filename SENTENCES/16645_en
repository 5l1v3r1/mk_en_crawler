SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The finance ministry has decided to close all duty-free shops and petrol stations at border checkpoints with non-EU member states Turkey, Serbia and Macedonia after it joins the EU in January.
Deputy Finance Minister Georgi Kadiev said on Tuesday (November 7th) that the measure is being taken at the request of the European Commission.
The IMF has also been seeking the shut-down of such businesses, suggesting they are a source of smuggling and corruption.

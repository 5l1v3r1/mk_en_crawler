ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic authorised conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) leader Ivo Sanader to form the country's new coalition government on Saturday (December 15th) after his party won the majority of seats at last month's general elections.
The prime minister candidate has 30 days to present his cabinet proposal to the members of parliament.
Sanader's HDZ won 66 seats at the November 25th general elections -- 11 seats short for a parliamentary majority.
Sanader has reportedly secured the missing seats -- and a second term as prime minister -- by winning over the Farmers' Party and the Liberal Party (HSS/HSLS), with eight seats, along with several minority representatives and the sole representative of the Pensioners' Party.
Opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) said Saturday it has asked Mesic to give them the mandate for the future government if Sanader fails to win a majority approval of his cabinet in parliament.

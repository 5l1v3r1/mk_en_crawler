ATHENS, Greece -- Demonstrators and police clashed outside the US Embassy in Athens on Wednesday (November 17th) during a rally marking the anniversary of the 1973 student anti-dictatorship protest.
Police used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the youth.
In all, at least 49 people were arrested and one person was injured, authorities said.
The annual demonstration was held amid heavy security, with over 6,000 police officers on duty.
More than 20,000 people marched through the capital.
A separate rally held in Thessaloniki attracted about 12,000 protestors.
Similar protests were also held in other cities.
This year's rally against the US support for the 1967-1974 military rule coincided with public protests against the government's austerity measures.
In an address to mark the anniversary, Prime Minister George Papandreou once again stressed the importance of the ongoing reforms.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A government decision enacting the controversial protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) entered into force on Tuesday (January 1st) despite strong opposition from the EU.
Croatia insists that fish stocks in the Adriatic Sea are exhausted by Italy, depriving it of 300m euros annually.
Italy catches ten times more fish each year than Croatia, according to Zagreb.
The European Commission, however, has warned that preventing access to EU members may affect Croatia's EU entry bid.
Neighbouring Slovenia, which took over the rotating EU presidency on Tuesday, has also condemned Croatia's planned zone.
In other news Tuesday, Croatia formally ended its tradition of mandatory military service, hoping the move to a better trained, volunteer army will prompt an invitation to join NATO this spring.
Also on Tuesday, Croatia assumed its two-year mandate as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Joining it are Libya, Vietnam, Costa Rica and Burkina Faso.
They will replace Slovakia, Congo, Ghana, Peru and Cyprus.

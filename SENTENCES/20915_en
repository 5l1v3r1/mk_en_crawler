ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis expressed hope on Wednesday (March 5th) that an opportunity to resolve the Cyprus issue will be found by the end of this year.
His comment followed a meeting in Athens with new Cypriot President Demetris Christofias.
The two leaders agreed that the plan to reunify Cyprus, proposed a few years ago by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, is no longer valid.
Christofias also urged Turkey not to interfere in talks between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus.
"It is important that Turkey leaves freedom to the Cypriots to talk about the future of their common land," Christofias said.
He described reunification talks as his main priority.

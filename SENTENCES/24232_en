TIRANA, Albania -- Heavy snowfall snarled roads in northern Albania on Sunday (December 14th), blocking traffic between the cities of Kukes and Peshkopia. 
The snow was up to 30cm deep in a mountainous area north of Shkodra, stranding residents of several villages. 
In the country's coastal areas, strong winds prevented cargo carriers from anchoring in the Durres port.

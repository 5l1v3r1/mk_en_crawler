ANKARA, Turkey -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday (June 24th) upheld the acquittal of prominent intellectual Fethullah Gulen, who faced charges of forming a terrorist organisation aimed at undermining the secular state. 
The ruling confirmed the verdict of a lower Turkish criminal court after a seven-year trial. 
Gulen is considered one of the most influential figures in the Islamic world.
In other news, the next hearing in the trial against the young man who allegedly gunned down Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink will occur on July 7th and will be open to the public, the court announced. 
Ogun Samast turns 18 later this month, thereby allowing the court to open the session to the public. 
A gunman shot Dink, 53, outside his Agos newspaper offices in Istanbul in January 2007.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided on Monday (October 13th) to allow an international investigation of allegedly illegal financial activity by Bosnian businessman Damir Fazlic and his links to state institutions.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said he is ready to prove to the public that the government granted no funds to Fazlic.
The opposition says Berisha and the government protected Fazlic after the justice ministry began investigating the legality of a probe by prosecutors.
Fazlic reportedly established business ties with Berisha and other government officials and registered a number of companies in 2005.
In other news, Italian authorities intercepted a boat Monday carrying illegal immigrants from Albania and Kosovo.
They seized the craft off the coast near Foggia with 30 people aboard, most of them children.

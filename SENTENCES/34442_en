ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (15 October) to appoint a civilian commission to monitor the country's security services.
The seven members include university professors, a human rights activist, and a lawyer.
They will serve for four years and will be supervised by the parliamentary committee on national security.
The commission's goal would be to ensure civilian oversight of the secret services and, in particular, monitor the use of surveillance and wiretapping.
Establishment of the commission was included in the 2002 Security Services Act.

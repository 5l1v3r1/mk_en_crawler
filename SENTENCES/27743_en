ATHENS, Greece -- The government on Friday (June 25th) approved a radical reform of the pension system and submitted it to parliament for discussion.
The bill would raise the retirement age to 65 for everyone.
Until now, women had been able to retire at 60.
The reform would also require Greeks to work 40 years to get a full pension, rather than the current 35-37 years.
Labour Minister Andreas Loverdos stressed that the reforms are necessary, given the economic crisis.
"Our system had collapsed, and we have to rebuild it," he said.
Trade unions oppose the reform and are calling for a general strike Tuesday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Anti-corruption office USKOK has asked Austrian authorities for permission to question former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, office spokesperson Vuk Djuricic confirmed on Tuesday (January 25th). 
If approved, Sanader would be interrogated by Austrian investigators, with Croatian representatives present and able to ask questions. 
Sanader was arrested on December 10th in Austria based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia, where he is being investigated for possible criminal actions and abuse of power. 
In an interview with the Austrian daily Salzburger Nachrichten last week, Sanader said he will not agree to a simplified extradition procedure until he sees the indictment against him.
In other news Tuesday, police announced the arrests of two men, accused of smuggling a woman and her son from Kosovo into Croatia, via Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
The woman, 28, froze to death during the overnight border crossing. 
Her body was discovered near the border with Bosnia. 
Four other people were arrested in BiH for suspected involvement in the trafficking.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Thursday (7 August), the Croatian Defence Ministry presented the second military police platoon that will join the international peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan. 
A group of 12 officers are scheduled to depart for Kabul on Monday, while the remaining part of the unit will join the mission on 27 August.
Also Thursday, a group of Danish military inspectors started a two-day visit of Croatian divisions in Zagreb, Sisak, Karlovac and Ogulin. 
The ministry of defence said the inspection would verify military information and examine ongoing restructuring activities. 
The mission is consistent with the 1999 Vienna Document, which allows OSCE members to make three visits per year to Croatia for control of conventional arms and disarmament.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- At a news conference on Friday (31 January) Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy outlined three conditions for his country's support of military action against Iraq:
repayment of Iraq's debt to Bulgaria and participation in post-war reconstruction efforts, guarantees for protection of Bulgaria's national security, and no requests for direct participation in military action.
Passy pledged the government's commitment to peaceful resolution of the Iraqi crisis, but expressed pessimism about the outcome.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's Parliamentary Speaker Oliver Dulic said Saturday (December 29th) that he has scheduled the next local elections for May 11th. 
He said this became possible after the parliament on Friday adopted a set of relevant leglislation, including laws on Serbia's territorial order, local self-government, and local elections.
Also on Saturday, Infrastructure Minister Velimir Ilic said he will run in the January 20th presidential elections. 
Ilic's party, New Serbia, is allied with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). 
The DSS has not said whether it will back Ilic or incumbent President Boris Tadic.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Consultations this week by the 12 parties in the BiH state-level parliament have failed to yield a compromise candidate for prime minister, forcing another round of meetings, BiH Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic said on Thursday (November 15th). 
Most of the parties say the candidate should come from one of the Serb parties, since Nikola Spiric, who resigned recently as prime minister, was from the Union of Independent Social Democrats, the ruling party in Republika Srpska (RS). 
He stepped down on November 1st, to protest new measures proposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak.
In other news, RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic visited Serbia on Thursday, meeting with President Boris Tadic and other officials. 
The visit prompted EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn to urge Belgrade not to interfere in BiH's domestic issues.

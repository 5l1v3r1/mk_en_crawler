ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is preparing to jump-start its EU accession bid via a draft of the third national programme, Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek announced on Monday (August 18th). 
Cicek said the document outlines the government's commitments over the next four years and envisions 131 legislative changes, including constitutional amendments. 
Legislators want the revisions to improve functions of the judiciary and other public institutions. 
The government lost momentum on accession last summer to political conflicts. 
Public interest is declining because of EU officials' alleged foot-dragging.

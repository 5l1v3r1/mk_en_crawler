PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A trial against nine former police and state security officials accused of 1992 war crimes against civilians opened on Thursday (November 26th) at a court in Podgorica. 
The group faces charges of deporting 79 Bosnian Muslim and Serb refugees who fled to Montenegro early in the Bosnian conflict. 
In her opening statement, prosecutor Lidija Vukcevic said the defendants violated international law by illegally detaining and deporting refugees. 
"Most of the Muslims that were handed over to Bosnian Serb forces were later executed" in prison camps near the eastern Bosnian town of Foca, she said. 
Five of the accused remain at large and are being tried in absentia. 
The rest have denied all charges, insisting they acted in line with government policy.

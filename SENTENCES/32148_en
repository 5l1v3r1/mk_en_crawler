BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government has issued a decision on the organisational structure and operations of the Romanian Naval Authority, the new institution formed by the merger of the Civil Navigation Inspectorate and the Romanian Naval Registry. 
The establishment of the new body is expected to bring the domestic legislation in this field closer to that of the EU and to international standards. 
The Naval Authority, which would be under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Housing, would oversee the national navigation system, technical certification of ships and related companies, and the training and testing of navigating personnel.

WASHINGTON, United States -- US President Barack Obama spoke by phone Monday (April 25th) with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the situations in Libya and Syria, the White House said in a statement. 
Obama thanked Turkey for its role in efforts to bring peace to Libya and for Ankara's involvement in NATO-led operations there. 
The two leaders agreed that attacks against civilians must end and that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi should step down and leave Libya "permanently". 
Obama and Erdogan also expressed concern about the "unacceptable use of violence" by the Syrian government.

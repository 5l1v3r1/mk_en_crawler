ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul ratified a law Tuesday (February 26th) viewed by the EU as an effort to strengthen the property rights of Turkey's non-Muslim population.
The so-called religious foundations law, adopted by parliament last week, allows religious foundations to regain ownership of some of their properties expropriated by the Turkish state in the past.
It also allows foreigners to register their foundations in Turkey.

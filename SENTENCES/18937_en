BUCHAREST, Romania -- US Ambassador to Romania Nicholas Taubman urged the country Thursday (May 3rd) to maintain its forces in Iraq, but acknowledged the "final decision lies in the hands of the Romanian authorities".
He and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu attended a military drill at a base in southeast Romania, which wrapped up a joint exercise that began last month.
Tariceanu wants Romanian troops out of Iraq by year's end.

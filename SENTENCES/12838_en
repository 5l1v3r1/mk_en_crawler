SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- After several weeks, the Croat Democratic Union has finally decided on a candidate for the vacant post of BiH presidency Croat member.
He is Ivo Miro Jovic, a member of the BiH House of Representatives.
The nomination must next be approved by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
He sacked the previous Croat member of the tripartite presidency, Dragan Covic, after embezzlement charges were filed against him.
In other news Tuesday (3 May), BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic met with UN tribunal chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte at The Hague.
They discussed BiH's commitment to war crimes co-operation, and the possible transfer of some war crimes cases to BiH courts.
Co-operation, especially by Republika Srpska, is crucial to BiH's bid for Euro-Atlantic integration.

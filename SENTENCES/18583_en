BUCHAREST, Romania -- Acting President Nicolae Vacaroiu insisted on Monday (May 7th) that Romania would not unilaterally withdraw its troops from Iraq without consulting with the United States and other coalition partners.
Vacaroiu met on Monday with US Ambassador to Bucharest Nicholas Taubman to discuss the issue, as well as the current political situation in Romania.
According to a press release from the presidency, the two agreed on the importance of continuing the bilateral strategic partnership.
In other news Monday, suspended President Traian Basescu's Democratic Party (PD) said that should voters support him in the May 19th referendum on impeachment, the PD would work to dissolve the current parliament and force early general elections.

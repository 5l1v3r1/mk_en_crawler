NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are meeting Friday (October 10th) in the latest round of direct talks aimed at reunifying the divided island. 
They are expected to discuss how to shape the future federal executive body under the chapter "Executive power and power sharing". 
After this chapter closes, observers expect the next issue to be property rights.
Also Thursday, a group of international statesmen known as The Elders, which includes former US President Jimmy Carter and South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called on Cypriot leaders to seize this opportunity to reunite the island. 
"The two leaders have an appointment with history," Tutu told a press conference during a visit to Nicosia. 
"Failure is not an option." (Anadolu news agency, Hurriyet, CNA, Politis, Philelefteros - 09/10/08)

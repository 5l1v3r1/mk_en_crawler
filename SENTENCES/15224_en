NEW YORK, United States -- The newly independent state of Montenegro became the 192nd member of the UN on Wednesday (28 June).
The resolution on Montenegro accession was introduced by Austria, current holder of the rotating EU presidency.
UN General Assembly President Jan Eliasson then called for approval of the resolution by acclamation and afterwards declared the Balkan republic a full member.
Outside, Montenegro's flag was raised alongside those of the other members.
Also Wednesday, Montenegro and Serbia reached a general agreement on issues related to post-referendum membership in international financial institutions.
Following talks in Podgorica, Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said that Belgrade will inherit the former state union's membership in the IMF and other institutions under current quotas, but will have to make some refunds to Montenegro.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN sappers completed a minesweeping operation Wednesday (March 26th) at a crossing point on Ledra Street in Nicosia that separates the Greek and Turkish sectors in the Cypriot capital. 
The operation at the 70m no-man's land, deserted since the Turkish invasion of 1974, was agreed on at last week's meeting between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. 
They also agreed on fresh efforts to reunify the divided island. 
The crossing could re-open late next week.
The minesweeping coincided with a visit to northern Cyprus by the chief of Turkey's General Staff, General Yasar Buyukanit. 
He met with Talat and vowed that Turkish troops will stay in Cyprus until a "fair and lasting" peace is established.
Separately, Greek Cypriot presidential adviser George Iacovou and Turkish Cypriot adviser Ozdil Nami agreed on Wednesday to establish six working groups and seven technical commissions to prepare for future direct talks on re-unification.

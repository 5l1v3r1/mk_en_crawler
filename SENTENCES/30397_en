PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX should launch an investigation into Dick Marty's allegations of human organ trafficking in Kosovo, US ambassador to Pristina Christopher Dell said in an interview with the Koha Ditore daily on Saturday (January 15th).
He said that if Marty has evidence behind his statements, he should reveal it to be able to assist the process.
In the same interview, Dell said that problems related to the December 12th snap elections in Kosovo could be settled with good governance rather than new elections.
According to him, the new cabinet should consist of people with "clean hands", so that citizens could regain trust in institutions.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade dropped charges Thursday (April 22nd) against six fans of the Partizan football team, suspected of making death threats against Serbian journalist Brankica Stankovic. 
Judge Jelena Milinovic concluded that the reporter was insulted, not threatened. 
Prosecutors plan to lodge an appeal. 
Stankovic has written a series of reports on the criminal activities of Serbian football fan clubs and their leaders.

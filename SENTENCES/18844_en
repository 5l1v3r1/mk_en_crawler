SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The four main parties in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) -- the Party for Democratic Action (SDA), Party for BiH, Croatian Democratic Union of BiH (HDZ BiH) and HDZ 1990 -- again failed to reach a deal Monday (February 5th) on a new entity cabinet.
SDA leader Sulejman Tihic spoke to reporters after a meeting of party chairmen in Sarajevo.
According to Tihic, they are close to a final agreement.
Local media reports suggest a last minute clarification sought by HDZ BiH leader Dragan Covic scuttled it for now.

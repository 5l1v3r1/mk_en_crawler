BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Mary Warlick voiced disappointment Tuesday (March 15th) over Serbia's decision not to attend next week's US-Balkans Business Summit in the US city of Baltimore, stressing political issues should be separated from those related to trade and investment. 
Belgrade will boycott the forum because Kosovo will be represented as a state. 
Warlick also said that Serbia and Kosovo should find a way to participate together at regional forums.

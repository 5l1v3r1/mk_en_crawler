PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Parliament (EP) is increasing pressure on the European Commission (EC) and the European Council to find a way to include Kosovo in the EU's visa liberalisation process. 
British EP member Sarah Ludford made the proposal Tuesday (September 29th), during a debate by the EP's Foreign Policy Committee. 
The same request has been made by EP Rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon.
Elsewhere, EC officials announced that a delegation will visit the border between Kosovo and Serbia to see if Serbian authorities treat it like any other border between states, local media reported on Wednesday. 
According to information from Brussels, the visit will take place by mid-October.

TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers rejected a proposal Monday (December 27th) to establish a parliamentary commission that would investigate the disputed 2009 general elections.
The proposal, by the opposition Socialist Party (SP), was rejected by a vote of 69-59, with one abstention.
The SP argued that their measure fully met the recommendations contained in an earlier resolution by the European Parliament to end the country's political crisis.
Both the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition agree generally on the need for a parliamentary commission, but differences over responsibilities, scope and composition have thwarted progress and prolonged the political stalemate.
Monday's was the last parliamentary session of this year.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha told lawmakers saying that local elections scheduled for May 8th will be held with or without the opposition.

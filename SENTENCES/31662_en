BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase rejected the idea of a cabinet shuffle Monday (13 January) saying it would be the least needed policy alternative for the country.
In response to recommended reforms from President Ion Iliescu, Nastase said state authorities should stay focused on EU and NATO integration, adding that such reshuffles could slow down the negotiation process.

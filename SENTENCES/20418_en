LUXEMBOURG -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU as planned on Monday (October 15th). 
The ceremony in Luxembourg was nearly delayed last week when Bulgaria challenged the spelling of the word "euro" in the document, demanding that it be spelled "evro", the Cyrillic spelling, in Bulgaria's copy of the document. 
That technicality was overcome, clearing the way for Monday's signing. 
The SAA represents an important step on the road to EU candidate status.

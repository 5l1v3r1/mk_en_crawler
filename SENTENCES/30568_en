ATHENS, Greece -- Several hundred people, including neo-Nazis, attacked about a dozen immigrants in Athens on Tuesday (May 10th) to avenge the killing of a man allegedly by foreigners. 
The crowd attacked the immigrants and demolished at least one shop owned by a member of the foreign community. 
Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and prevent them from attacking a house. 
The violence broke out after a 44-year-old man was stabbed to death earlier Tuesday while he was climbing into his car to take his pregnant wife to hospital. 
Police say witnesses describe the three attackers as foreigners who apparently wanted the camera the man was carrying.

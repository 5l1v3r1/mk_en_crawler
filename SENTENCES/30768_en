BERLIN, Germany/ZAGREB, Croatia -- A judge in Salzburg set a 14-day period of custody for Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Saturday (December 11th), pending extradition. 
Sanader was arrested in Austria the previous day after Croatia issued an international arrest warrant. 
The former prime minister had fled his country just hours before parliament voted to strip him of immunity as a lawmaker. 
He is reportedly under investigation for possible criminal actions and abuse of power.
Croatian justice authorities say they will send documents needed for extradition to their Austrian counterparts. 
Meanwhile, Sanader's Austrian lawyer, Werner Suppan, said Saturday that his client will not oppose extradition to Croatia. 
Sanader is the highest Croatian official to be investigated for corruption to date.
Commenting on Sanader's arrest, President Ivo Josipovic told the daily Jutarnji List that "nobody in Croatia can stop the fight against corruption any more. 
Those trying to do so will be definitively swept off the political stage." (Hina, HRT, Poslovni Dnevnik, Jutarnji List, DPA, AFP - 11/12/10)

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Lawmakers rejected a no-confidence motion on Tuesday (April 13th) against Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's cabinet, submitted by the opposition Movement for Changes (PzP) and other parties. 
The vote was 47 to 27, with two members abstaining. 
The opposition had accused the government of failing to fight corruption and organised crime, as well as inefficiency in addressing a bad economy. 
In a heated debate that preceded the vote, Djukanovic accused the opposition of seeking to destroy the economic base and of instigating public discontent.

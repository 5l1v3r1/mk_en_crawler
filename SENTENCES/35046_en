BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said Monday (28 June) that he would probably run for president in the 28 November election.
President Ion Iliescu must step down after serving two terms, and the ruling Social Democrats have focused their efforts on Nastase taking his place.
Nastase admitted that his party would have to change its strategy following the setback it suffered in recent local elections.
He also reiterated his commitment to far-reaching reforms that would eventually result in EU membership.
He linked a planned cabinet reshuffle to the successful completion of Romania's accession negotiations.

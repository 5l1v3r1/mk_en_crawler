BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Coalition of Refugee Associations in Serbia on Monday (August 2nd) deplored the lack of progress in resolving problems facing Serbs who fled Croatia after the 1995's Operation Storm. 
In a statement released ahead of the 15th anniversary of the operation, the coalition called on the authorities in Serbia and Croatia to demonstrate real political will and start resolving refugees' problems. 
The Croatian military operation that began on August 4th 1995 ended with the elimination of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina and marked the end of the 1991-1995 conflict in Croatia. 
An estimated 200,000 Serb civilians living in Croatia fled to Serbia.

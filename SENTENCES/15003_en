BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Most of the opposition parties in Republika Srpska (RS) reportedly have signalled they could support Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) leader Milorad Dodik as RS prime minister-designate. 
RS President Dragan Covic, who will present the mandate for forming a new government, held a second day of consultations in Banja Luka on Wednesday (1 February). 
Local media reports afterwards suggested the Bosniak and Croat parties in parliament generally favour Dodik. 
His SNSD initiated the successful no-confidence motion that last week brought down the government led by the Serb Democratic Party.

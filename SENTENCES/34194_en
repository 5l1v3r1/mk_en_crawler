ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis announced on Wednesday (9 July) that all lawmakers would be required to declare the sources of their income and assets acquired after 1990.
The move is aimed at increasing transparency and curbing corruption.
Members of parliament from Simitis's ruling PASOK party will also have to declare their stock market transactions during 1998-2000, when the bourse suffered a collapse.
The measure will be extended to all elected central and local government officials.
Simitis also called for an objective system for hiring public sector staff and new measures to control campaign spending during the May 2004 elections.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A petition launched by the United Regions of Serbia (URS) three weeks ago pushing for decentralisation of Serbia has been backed by 225,000 citizens so far, URS president Mladjan Dinkic announced on Monday (April 25th). 
He predicted it would attract the support of more than 300,000 people by May 30th when it will be submitted to parliament. 
The URS proposes that 80% of payroll taxes be given to local authorities, who collect them; that citizens be allowed to directly elect the municipality president and mayor; and that confiscated property should be returned to local self-governments.

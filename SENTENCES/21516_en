ANKARA, Turkey -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) urged Turkey's Constitutional Court on Monday (June 23rd) to rule in line with European principles regarding a closure case pending against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
In an unusual move, PACE President Luis Maria de Puig called for a session Thursday on the "functioning of democratic institutions in Turkey" in order to discuss the closure case against the AKP. 
The secularist main opposition party, the Republican People's Party, opposes PACE's planned special session. 
Supreme Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya makes his case to the court Tuesday. 
He says the AKP threatens secularism in Turkey.

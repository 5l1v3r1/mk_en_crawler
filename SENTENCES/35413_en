ANKARA, Turkey -- Officials were optimistic about their country's bid for EU membership after agreement was reached in New York to launch talks on the reunification of Cyprus. 
"When we finish everything and when the Cyprus issue is settled, nobody can say no to the start of negotiations," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Friday (13 February). 
The Cypriot leaders agreed to let Greece and Turkey work out any differences between them by 22 March. 
Ankara and Athens would then have one week to settle the disputes. 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan will serve as final arbitrator after 29 March. 
The EU has said that solving the Cyprus issue will facilitate Turkey's bid for the start of accession talks. 
Ankara wants to launch negotiations by the end of the year.

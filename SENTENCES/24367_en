BELGRADE, Serbia -- Two gendarmerie officers sustained non-life threatening injuries on Thursday (July 9th) in a grenade attack in the village of Lucane, in the predominantly Albanian Presevo Valley near the Kosovo border, media reported.
The officers were on a regular patrol when a rocket propelled grenade hit their vehicle.
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic condemned the attack as a terrorist act and vowed Serbia will take action to counter any attempt to violate its territorial integrity.
In other news, Italian authorities arrested Muharem Gasi, an ethnic Albanian charged in Serbia with war crimes committed in Kosovo in 1999, Serbian media reported.
As a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Gasi allegedly participated in an attack on a house which killed the owner and injured other members of his family.
A court in Bologna will decide on Gasi's extradition to Serbia.

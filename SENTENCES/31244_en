TIRANA, Albania -- The International Federation of Journalists criticised on Tuesday (February 1st) a request by the parliamentary commission investigating the January 21st violent protest to obtain records of mobile conversations by public figures, including journalists. 
The organisation said the request is illegal and it urged authorities in Albania, a member of the European Council, to respect the confidentiality of journalists' sources. 
The federation also condemned the violence against journalists on the day of the demonstration.

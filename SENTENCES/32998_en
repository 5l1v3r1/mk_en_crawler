BUCHAREST, Romania -- Top Romanian Army officials, led by Gen Mihai Popescu, met on Tuesday (24 June) with a delegation from Belgrade, led by Serbian-Montenegrin Army Gen Branko Krga. 
They discussed enhancing bilateral military co-operation, assisting each other in army reforms, and joint efforts to promote regional security.
In other news, 60 Romanian "black wolves" -- special soldiers from the Iasi Infantry Battalion 151 -- left for Afghanistan late Monday to join the International Security Assistance Force, replacing a unit that wrapped up its six-month tour of duty. 
The deployments are part of Romania's contribution as a future NATO member.

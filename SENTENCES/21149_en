SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Saturday (March 1st) that he has not noticed anyone from Serbia trying to transfer tensions over Kosovo's declaration of independence into BiH. 
He downplayed Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik's opposition to Kosovo's independence and concerns that if Sarajevo decides to recognise Pristina, then Bosnian Serbs would have to reconsider their position. 
Besides, Lajcak pointed out, Dodik has said he would guarantee peace and stability in RS and had confirmed that at the Peace Implementation Council. 
In an interview for the Belgrade-based newspaper Vecernje Novosti, Lajcak said protests in RS against Kosovo's independence stayed within acceptable limits.

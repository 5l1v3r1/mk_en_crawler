ANKARA, Turkey -- The government confirmed on Saturday (5 April) that it was expelling three Iraqi diplomats. 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the three men had been asked to leave immediately for engaging in "activities exceeding their duties". 
He explained that the decision had been made following an investigation by authorities. 
Weeks ago, the United States asked all countries to expel Iraqi diplomats. 
Gul did not identify the three, but media reports quote sources who say they are the first and second secretaries of the embassy and the deputy trade attach√©.
A Turkish court, meanwhile, sentenced ten police officers to prison for torture. 
Twice before they had been acquitted of the charges. 
This time, the case was watched closely as a test of Ankara's resolve to eliminate torture in its police and prison systems.

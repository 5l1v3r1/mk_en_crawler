SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The IMF Resident Representative to Bulgaria, James Roaf, says foreign investors might be worried by delays in forming the new Bulgarian government. 
In a press interview published Thursday (7 July), Roaf said the Fund was not concerned generally that political instability could lead to macroeconomic risks. 
He noted, however, that foreign investors prefer a predictable political environment. 
The three parties that did best in the 25 June parliamentary elections -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party, NMS-II and the ethnic Movement for Rights and Freedoms -- plan to continue talks aimed at forming a coalition government. 
Leaders of the three parties failed to reach an agreement Wednesday.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided on Monday (6 June) to grant provisional release to former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
The judges overruled the objections of prosecutors and said there is no reason to believe that the former Kosovo Liberation Army commander would fail to return to The Hague for his trial, or that he posed a threat to witnesses or others while he is free. 
Indicted for war crimes during the 1998-1999 conflict in the province, Haradinaj surrendered in March.

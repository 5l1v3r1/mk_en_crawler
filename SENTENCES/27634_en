TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities have decided to raze the Pyramid -- an icon of communism in downtown Tirana -- and build a new parliament building in its place. 
The Pyramid was built by dictator Enver Hoxha and used to serve as a museum in the days before democracy. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha promised on Monday (October 25th) to complete the new building by 2012, on the 100th anniversary of the country's independence. 
"There can be no Pyramid in downtown Tirana that makes memories of one of the worst dictatorships in Europe fixed forever in our minds," Berisha said. 
He confirmed that his Democratic Party's parliamentary group decided on the issue last week.

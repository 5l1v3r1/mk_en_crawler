NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriots voted overwhelmingly on Saturday (24 April) against the UN plan for the reunification of Cyprus. 
Exit polls from the referendum showed about 70 per cent opposed the blueprint. 
On the Turkish side of Cyprus, about 60 per cent of the voters backed the plan. 
Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat, a strong proponent of reunification, immediately urged the international community to lift or alleviate sanctions against the self-proclaimed republic in the north. 
"The Turkish Cypriot people can no longer be seen as separatist or intransigent," he said. 
Talat's remarks were echoed by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, who said embargoes against the Turkish part of the island should not continue. 
The plan's rejection means that only the Greek part of Cyprus will join the EU on 1 May. 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the European Commission expressed regrets over the plan's rejection and commended Turkish Cypriots for their vote (Bloomberg, AFP, Anadolu Agency, Turkish Press, UN Press Release - 24/04/04)

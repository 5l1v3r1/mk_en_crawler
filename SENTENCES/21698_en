BELGRADE, Serbia -- Slovakia will advocate the faster signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and Serbia, Slovak Foreign Minister Jan Kubis said during a visit to Belgrade on Monday (April 21st).
Kubis, who met with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, urged that the SAA be signed right away to provide an opportunity for Serbia and the EU to strengthen ties.
"It is extremely important that there be a firm position among EU members ...
that Serbia is a future partner," Kubis said.
Slovakia is one of the bloc members that refuse to recognise Kosovo's independence.

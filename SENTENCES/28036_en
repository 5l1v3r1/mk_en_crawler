TIRANA, Albania -- The transport ministry announced on Monday (May 17th) it is suing former Minister Spartak Poci for alleged abuse of power, stemming from a rail deal with the US company General Electric. 
Poci is suspected of failing to get parliament's approval for the $75m deal to rebuild a 38km railway section connecting Durres to Tirana. 
The ruling Democratic Party cancelled the deal in 2005, arguing it was too pricey. 
GE, meanwhile, took the matter to the International Court of Arbitration in Rome and won $14.8m in compensation. 
If found guilty, Poci, a member of the opposition Socialist Party, faces up to seven years in prison.

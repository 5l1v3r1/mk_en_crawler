ATHENS, Greece -- The 12th Paralympic Games officially closed in Athens Tuesday (28 September) evening.
The ceremony was scaled back in light of an incident that killed seven Greek teenagers the previous day.
Chinese athletes dominated the Games, winning 63 gold medals.
In other news, an Olympic Airlines jet bound for New York was diverted amid claims of a bomb onboard.

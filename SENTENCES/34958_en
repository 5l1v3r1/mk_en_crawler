NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriots held elections Sunday (14 December) to elect a new parliament. 
The opposition is believed to have an edge in the vote, which is taking place only in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of North Cyprus. 
The outcome is considered likely to influence whether the Turkish and Greek parts of the island will unite in order to enter the EU together.

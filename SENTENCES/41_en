Romania has to close three difficult chapters -- Environment, Justice, and Home Affairs and Competition -- by the end of the year in order to sign the Accession Treaty in the first half of 2005 and achieve EU membership during 2007.
Although the task is daunting, Romanian chief negotiator for the EU Vasile Puscas says he remains optimistic.
Southeast European Times:
The European Commission (EC) finally granted Romania functioning market economy status.
Was this simply a "diplomatic gift", as the headlines suggested?
Vasile Puscas:
It is not a "diplomatic gift" at all.
We set out to fulfil the basic criteria of a functioning market economy, from liberalised prices to a low inflation rate and a stable macroeconomic situation, and all of these were accomplished.
States that received the same status -- Bulgaria in 2002, Poland in 1997 -- were analysed according to the same criteria.
SETimes:
The EC's report cautions that the Romanian economy does not currently have the capacity to meet the pressures of competition in a single European market.
Puscas:
Aspects of Central and Eastern European transitional countries were taken into account when EU criteria were established in 1993.
It was expected that countries should reach the status of a functioning market economy, and then, if reforms were continued, an increased competitive level would take place.
SETimes:
Do you expect, then, that the Romanian economy will be able to cope with competitive pressures in the future?
Puscas:
It is absolutely necessary.
What concerns us in our involvement as players in the EU market is that we have to cope with our own competitive system and become prepared, with our own products, for an enlarged market of 500 million people.
I emphasise that this year's country report states that Romania will be able to deal, in 2007, with member state status.
SETimes:
Will you be able to close the three remaining chapters -- Environment, Justice, and Home Affairs and Competition -- by the end of the year?
Puscas:
The strategy paper mentioned for the first time that "the Commission will make every effort" to conclude negotiations by the end of the year.
Until now, it was a common objective to conclude negotiations in 2004.
The chapters will be closed in December.
At that time, the European Council, meeting in force, will assess the accession issue both for Bulgaria and Romania.
SETimes:
The last country report includes sharp criticism concerning issues such as media freedom and corruption.
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Puscas:
It makes us all uncomfortable.
We need to be careful, because this report is not addressed only to the chief negotiator or his team, but to all Romanians, to Romanian society.
And we need to watch to make sure that the government supports measures for guaranteeing media freedom, develops the legal aspects and ensures implementation.
We need to deal with these critiques and to be sure they don’t spread to other sectors, because freedom of expression is a much wider area.
SETimes:
The term "high-level corruption" showed up for the first time during this administration within the 2003 Commission report.
This term was never used before.
Puscas:
Corruption needs to be approached from top to bottom.
We are trying such an approach and the National Anti-Corruption Prosecution Office understands the importance of the issue.
Corruption is not only a matter of morality or politics.
I previously mentioned the competitive system -- competition will strengthen only if corruption decreases.
SETimes:
You accepted a "safeguard clause" allowing Brussels to postpone Romania’s accession for one year if commitments are not met.
Were you pushed by the EU to accept it as a means of continuing the momentum for reforms after negotiations are closed?
Puscas:
Special clauses were also enforced for the ten [new member] countries regarding justice, domestic affairs and agriculture.
The novelty in the case of Bulgaria and Romania is this safeguard clause, allowing for postponement of the accession date if, during the monitoring process, the results do not match initial commitments.
SETimes:
Elections are coming up in November.
How might a change in government influence the negotiations and the accession process?
Puscas:
We hope all technical solutions still under negotiation will be finalised at that time.
I also hope that, in the remaining period, politicians will not influence the negotiation process, but leave it on its natural course until December.

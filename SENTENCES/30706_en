PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Civilian Office (ICO) will not interfere in the issues of forming the government, head of office Pieter Feith, was quoted as saying by local media on Sunday (February 13th). 
Feith told Belgrade-based B92 radio that Kosovo leaders should decide about the government structures, but he reiterated that cabinet members should have high moral integrity. 
According to him, the sooner the government is constituted, the sooner negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade will start. 
Feith added that Kosovo's reputation was affected by Dick Marty's report on human organ trafficking, but advised the Kosovo government to be as open to investigations as possible. 
Feith said it is crucial that political leaders suspected of this trafficking involvement are not part of the new government.

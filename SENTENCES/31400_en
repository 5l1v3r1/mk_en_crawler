STRASBOURG, France -- A negative reference to Bulgaria was removed Tuesday (28 January) from a draft report on Freedom of Expression in the Media in Europe.
The report, by the Council of Europe's Committee on Culture, Science and Education, covers 44 countries.
The text Bulgaria found objectionable read:
"[in] certain countries it is still far too easy to replace heads of public media according to the whims of the authorities, as for example in the case of the General Director of the Bulgarian News Agency, BTA." Bulgarian Parliament member Milena Milotinova insisted that the sentence be removed.

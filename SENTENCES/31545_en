ANKARA, Turkey -- Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said Thursday (17 April) that his government has received a request from the United States to send troops and civilian experts to help in the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. 
He did not specify the tasks these soldiers would be required to perform, but said the cabinet was studying the offer. 
Turkey has also been asked to provide medical supplies and communications equipment. 
According to Gonul, the request was made in the form of a non-paper, an unofficial diplomatic note that is not necessarily binding to either party.

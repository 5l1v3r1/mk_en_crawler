ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves for Africa on Tuesday (1 March) on a mission to boost economic ties.
He will meet with Ethiopian officials on Wednesday and open an office of the state-run Turkish Co-operation and Development Foundation in Addis Ababa.
Erdogan will then travel to South Africa, Turkey's main trading partner on the continent.
In other news, the EU warned Turkey on Monday that it should sign a protocol extending an existing customs union with the EU to the ten new countries that joined the Union last May, including Cyprus.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said any failure to do so could jeopardise the launch of accession talks.
Ankara has denied any suggestion of "fatigue" in relations between Brussels and Ankara.

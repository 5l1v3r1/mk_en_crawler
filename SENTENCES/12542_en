SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The registration deadline for parties and coalitions that intend to run in the 25 June parliamentary elections expires Monday (9 May), according to the Central Electoral Commission. 
Thus far, 15 applications have been submitted, or nearly four times fewer than in the last elections in 2001. 
Tougher entry requirements were approved by parliament earlier this year.
On Sunday, meanwhile, Minister for EU Affairs Meglena Kuneva vowed that the government would complete its mandate by adopting a new penal code. 
That is a condition for Bulgaria's scheduled EU entry in 2007.

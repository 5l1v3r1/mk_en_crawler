ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament Speaker Koksal Toptan called on Monday (June 29th) to adopt the proposed amendments to the constitution that would allow taking leaders of the 1980 military coup to trial.
Currently, Article 15 of the constitution prevents this, but last week, the main opposition Republican People's Party proposed the change.
"Such an article does not belong in a modern constitution," Toptan told reporters.
Also last week, parliament passed a law that allows civilian courts to prosecute military officers accused of threatening national security, constitutional violations and attempts to topple the government.

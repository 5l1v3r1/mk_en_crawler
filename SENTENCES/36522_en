BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica stressed Friday (7 May) that co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal is an international obligation of Serbia-Montenegro and part of the cabinet's platform. 
In an interview with Italy's Avvenire magazine, Kostunica conceded that former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic is the main obstacle to Serbia's international integration efforts. 
He added that greatest impediment to the country's reform process was the March 2003 murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
In other news, the reputed mastermind of the assassination, Milorad Lukovic, also known as Legija, is due to appear in court late Monday. 
He surrendered to police 2 May under mysterious circumstances.

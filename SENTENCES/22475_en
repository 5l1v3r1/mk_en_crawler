PARIS, France -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Dmitrij Rupel said on Sunday (July 13th) that Croatia may open all EU negotiating chapters by autumn next year but may not close them all.
On the sidelines of an initiative in Paris to establish a union of Mediterranean countries, Rupel said Slovenia has never blocked and does not intend to block neighbouring Croatia's EU bid.
"I hope that Croatia continues as it started, that it engages;
I even hope it speeds up its preparations for the EU.
There is a lot of work to do," he said.

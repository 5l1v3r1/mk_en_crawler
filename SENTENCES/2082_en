Macedonia's Parliament approved Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's new government on Friday (17 December) after a three-day debate.
MPs from the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, the Democratic Union of Integration and the Liberal Democrats voted in favour, while those from the VMRO-DPMNE, the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party of Albanians voted "no".
The cabinet is the third to take office since the For Macedonia Together Coalition won the 2002 parliamentary elections.
"After a long but not futile debate, the parliament approved the new government which is now facing major challenges," said Buckovski after the voting in a statement for Southeast European Times.
"I am convinced that we will fulfil what I emphasised in my address.
Macedonia will carry through the reforms and receive an invitation for NATO membership and will become a candidate for EU membership.
I hope that, afterwards, Macedonia will be a prosperous, stable and safe country."
In his address to lawmakers, Buckovski pointed to completing the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement as one of the new government's priorities, noting that two major items of legislation -- the laws on use of minority languages and symbols -- are still awaiting passage.
Another priority, he said, would be improving the economy.
"We will propose measures for improvement of competitiveness and strategies for development of export-oriented sectors in the industrial areas.
This should affect â€¦ the living standards of all," Buckovski said.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliamentary Speaker and acting President Dragan Marsicanin on Friday (20 February) asked former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica to form Serbia's next government.
The nomination followed the Serbian Renewal Movement's decision to join the coalition consisting of Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, G17 Plus and New Serbia.
The Democratic Party of late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic has declined to support the new cabinet, which is now expected to receive backing from Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists.
Kostunica said Saturday that a growing rift is developing between the Socialists and Milosevic, and that the new political developments do not signal a political comeback by the former Yugoslav strongman.
But he also said that sending war criminals to The Hague would not be a "top priority" for the cabinet, and vowed not to extradite four officials who were recently indicted by the UN tribunals.
In an interview with Italian newspaper <I>Corriere della Sera</I>, released Saturday, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte expressed concern about the new government.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, meanwhile, has until 31 March to certify to Congress whether Serbia is co-operating in good faith with the war crimes court.
The certification would allow the republic to receive US aid and assistance from Washington via international financial institutions.

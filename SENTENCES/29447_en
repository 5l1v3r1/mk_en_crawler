BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade is due to announce on Thursday (November 4th) the verdicts of ten people charged with supporting war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic and helping him evade justice between 2002 and 2006 by sheltering him in their Belgrade apartments. 
The prosecution and the defence made their final statements Monday. 
If convicted, the defendants face up to eight years in prison.
In other news, war crimes prosecutors announced on Tuesday that raids are under way in three locations related to people close to Mladic. 
Officials say only that two are in Belgrade, and the third operation is in Arandjelovac.

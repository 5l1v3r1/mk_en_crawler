WASHINGTON, United States -- A US citizen who was arrested in Kosovo last month has been charged by the US District Court in Brooklyn for allegedly seeking training from Islamic militants to fight US troops outside the United States, authorities said on Thursday (September 24th).
Betim Kaziu, 21, was arrested in Kosovo in August after he had travelled to Cairo and tried to reach Iraq and Afghanistan.
The FBI says that while in Egypt, Kaziu made repeated attempts to buy weapons and join a terrorist group linked to al-Qaeda.

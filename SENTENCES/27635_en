BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's committee for missing people, Veljko Odalovic, said on Monday (October 25th) that Bosnian authorities have found the remains of 370 people on the Bosnian side of Perucac Lake, in addition to 11 uncovered by Serbian authorities.
Both groups of investigators will share information, he stressed.
According to preliminary findings, the victims were killed by Bosnian Serb Milan Lukic and his paramilitary group.
In July 2009, the UN war crimes tribunal sentenced Lukic to life in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslim civilians in the town of Visegrad, from 1992 to 1994.
The Perucac, a reservoir on the Drina River, marks the border between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

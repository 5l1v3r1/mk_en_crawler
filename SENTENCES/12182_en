THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The recent surrender of high-profile indictees from Serbia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that international pressure is working, UN tribunal president Theodor Meron said Friday (11 March). 
Ten suspects have surrendered to the UN court since January, bringing the total number of defendants in The Hague to about 70. 
These surrenders, Meron said, have raised expectations that top suspects, such as Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, will soon end up in custody as well. 
In Strasbourg, meanwhile, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) President Rene van der Linden said the flurry of surrenders suggest a change from the hitherto "obstructionist and politicised" approach of some governments towards war crimes co-operation (AP, CoE Web site - 11/03/05)

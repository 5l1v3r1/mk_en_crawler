THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal has decided to grant former Yugoslav naval commander Miodrag Jokic early release after he served two-thirds of his term in prison, media reported on Tuesday (September 2nd). 
In 2004, the court sentenced Jokic for shelling the Croatian town of Dubrovnik in December 1991 and sent him to Denmark to serve a seven-year term.
Explaining the court's decision, tribunal President Fausto Pocar said the Danish prison management has noted Jokic's good behaviour during his time there. 
Even before the sentence, Jokic demonstrated that he wants to be "rehabilitated" by showing remorse and by "honestly co-operating with the prosecution", Pocar said. 
After surrendering to the tribunal in 2001, he pleaded guilty in 2003 to all six counts in the indictment.

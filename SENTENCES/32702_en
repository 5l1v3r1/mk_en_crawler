THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (18 December) denied a motion by prosecutors to appoint a lawyer for Slobodan Milosevic. 
The judges also rejected suggestions that they should extend the trial to let the former Yugoslav president take more days off. 
Before adjourning the proceedings until 6 January, Judge Richard May said he would not grant the prosecution more time to make its case except for the days Milosevic has been ill, roughly one month so far.
In other news, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte called on the tribunal to sentence former Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic to between 15 and 25 years in prison. 
Del Ponte said she would have asked for life in prison had Plavsic not shown remorse. 
Plavsic's lawyers argue that she should be sentenced to no more than eight years in prison.

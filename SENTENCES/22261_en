SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two key Bosnian politicians -- Sulejman Tihic, the leader of the main Bosniak party, the Democratic Action Party (SDA), and Dragan Covic, leader of the main Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ ) -- are calling for a reconstruction of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (FBiH) government, media reported on Thursday (October 16th). 
Tihic said the government is inefficient and that replacing some ministers and restructuring some ministries would help improve its performance. 
He added the FBiH presidency would call a meeting of ruling coalition party leaders in 15 days and that he would add the issue to the agenda.
For his part, Covic implied that the SDA and the HDZ, as winners of the recent local elections, should have more representation in the government. 
The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH), currently the strongest party in the cabinet but also the biggest loser of the October 5th local polls, says there is no need to change the cabinet.
In other news Thursday, Republika Srpska's (RS) government declared Dutch Ambassador to BiH Karel Vosskuhler persona non grata in RS. 
The move came in response to an interview Vosskuhler gave to the daily Dnevni Avaz in which he said RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik is "worse than Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko". 
The ambassador "crossed the line not only of acceptable diplomatic behaviour but also of good manners", according to an RS government statement.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Constitutional Court ruled Saturday (23 July) that the new bill on the country's public broadcasting system did not jeopardise the vital national interests of the Croat people in BiH.
The Croat caucus at the BiH Parliament House of Peoples (HoP) asked the Court for a ruling, arguing that some provisions might be detrimental to Croats' rights.
The constitutional judges, however, rejected these concerns and the law was returned to the HoP's agenda.
Together with police reform, the restructuring of the national broadcasting sector is a major condition set by the EU for the start of Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with BiH.

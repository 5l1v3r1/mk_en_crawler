SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament's inquiry commission rejected on Tuesday (19 April) a demand by a group of ethnic Albanian opposition deputies for partial invalidation of the results of recent local elections.
According to the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), revoting should take place in 16 municipalities populated predominantly by ethnic Albanians, including Gostivar, Tetovo, Lipkovo, Aracinovo, Struga and Tearce.
The DPA, which boycotted the run-off vote, insists serious irregularities marred the first round, held on 13 March.
Members of the commission representing other parliamentary parties turned down the request as groundless.

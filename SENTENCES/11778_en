ATHENS, Greece -- The parliamentary committee investigating the former PASOK administration's arms procurement deals completed hearings Friday (17 December) with testimony from Defence Minister Spilios Spiliotopoulos.
The defense minister said contracts sealed by his predecessors for the purchase of Russian TOR M1 air defence missile systems and radar equipment harmed Greek interests.
The inquiry panel is expected to present its findings in mid-January.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- A court in London on Wednesday (December 16th) sentenced an Albanian national to seven years in prison for terrorism.
The verdict came after an anti-terror investigation uncovered evidence that Krenar Lusha, 30, was recruited by al-Qaeda while studying Islam in Qatar.
He was arrested in August 2008.
Bomb making manuals and other tools to produce explosive devices were found in his possession.
Suspicions grew after he was caught downloading anti-West material and bomb manuals from the internet.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Nineteen coal miners died in a methane gas explosion in a shaft in northwest Turkey, Labour Minister Omer Dincer announced on Friday (December 11th).
The blast occurred late Thursday in a mine near the city of Bursa.
A fire broke out after the explosion, at a depth of around 250m-350m.
Teams trying to recover the miners' bodies are hampered by the high concentration of gas inside the shaft.

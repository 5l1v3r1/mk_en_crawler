NEW YORK, United States -- US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad said on Tuesday (June 5th) that the UN Security Council would take no steps on the new draft resolution regarding Kosovo until the G8 summit, which is under way in Germany, ends late Wednesday.
Media reports suggest no vote will be taken until after high-level talks between the US and Russia take place, which is expected to happen on the sidelines of the summit.
Khalilzad indicates the vote will come later this week.

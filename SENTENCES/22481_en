TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Sunday (July 13th) that the future of Albanians lies not in a Greater Albania but within a Great Europe, once again dismissing allegations he backs a vision of linking the region's Albanian populations. 
"Albania, like Kosovo and Serbia, has projected its future in the EU and NATO. 
The EU is a family that all countries should have an equal right to join with completed standards, their dignity and identity," Topi told the Belgrade-based Beta news agency. 
As for ties with Serbia, Topi said Albania wants "mutually beneficial relations".

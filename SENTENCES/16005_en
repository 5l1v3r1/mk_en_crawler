BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said on Monday (17 April) that the new law on military amnesty, passed by the Serbian Parliament earlier in the day, would eliminate criminal charges but not the obligation for army service. 
It affects some 2,500 people who have avoided army service since 7 October 2000. 
Many of them left the country to avoid criminal proceedings. 
Stankovic noted that the entire issue could be resolved through the planned transformation of the federal union's army into a fully professional force by 2010.
In other news Monday, nine police cadets were injured in an explosion that occurred during a training exercise in Zemun. 
Seven people had to be hospitalised. 
Authorities are investigating the blast.

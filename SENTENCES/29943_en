SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Several people were injured on Friday (May 20th) in downtown Sofia during clashes between supporters of the nationalist ATAKA party and praying Muslims. 
The nationalists gathered in front of the Banya Bashi Mosque to protest mosque's loudspeakers. 
They claim that the sound of the call to payer coming from the loudspeakers disturbs the public order. 
The police detained several ATAKA activists. 
The move angered the party leader Volen Siderov who threatened to withdraw its support for the government and called for resignation of the Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov.
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who was on a visit to Poland, commented that he has always advocated for ethnic tolerance. 
President Georgi Parvanov and political parties condemned strongly the incident.
Meanwhile, Turkey condemned strongly the incident in Sofia. 
The Foreign Ministry said that it expects from the Bulgarian authorities to detain and punish those responsible for the attack. 
The ministry also expects that necessary measures will be taken in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.

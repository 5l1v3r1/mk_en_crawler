BUCHAREST, Romania -- Thousands of coal miners went on strike Monday (23 February) to protest planned industry-wide layoffs. 
An estimated 35,000 mineworkers are expected to join the walkout during the week. 
Labour unions reported that 17,000 miners are already on strike and put the industry's losses at $3m a day. 
Mineworkers have played a crucial role in Romania's recent history, suppressing an anti-government campaign in 1990. 
A year later, their violent protests toppled the first post-communist cabinet.
In other news, Finance Minister Mihail Tanasescu estimates that the current deficit amounts to about 5.9 per cent of GDP, less than the previous estimate of 6.5 per cent. 
He said the government plans to cut the deficit to less than 3 per cent. 
The exact figure will be determined during ongoing talks with the IMF.

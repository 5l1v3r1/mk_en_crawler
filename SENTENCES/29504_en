THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The defence team representing retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina on Tuesday (August 31st) asked UN war crimes tribunal judges to acquit their client of charges that he persecuted ethnic Serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 conflict in Croatia.
In its closing statement, the defence claimed that Gotovina has done everything he could to prevent crimes.
They also stated there is no evidence of civilians being killed during the shelling of Knin and other cities in Krajina.
Gotovina and two fellow retired generals -- Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac -- stand accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes stemming from 1995's Operation Storm.
Their trial started in March 2008.

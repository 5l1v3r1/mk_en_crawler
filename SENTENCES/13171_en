THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic and UN prosecutors argued against a motion Tuesday (29 November) to split the former Yugoslav leader's trial into two parts.
Judges suggested last week that they could expedite the marathon proceedings by issuing a separate verdict in the Kosovo case and then proceeding with the part of the trial that deals with the Bosnian and Croatian conflicts.
Milosevic called the move "illogical and unlawful".
Prosecutors contended that events in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s should be viewed as one whole rather than as separate events.

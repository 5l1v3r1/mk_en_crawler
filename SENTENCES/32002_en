ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Abdullah Gul presented his government's programme to parliament Saturday (23 November), promising to promote democracy and economic reform.
As priorities, he cited the streamlining of state bureaucracy, increased privatisation, and attracting more foreign investment.
He also vowed to protect human rights, particularly the rights of prisoners, a problem cited repeatedly by the EU.
Gul added that joining the Union will remain at the top of his ministers' agenda.
He also discussed constitutional amendments, including some that would allow the leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to become prime minister.
Parliament will debate the programme before holding a confidence vote Tuesday.
Also Saturday, Gul signalled support for a UN plan on Cyprus.

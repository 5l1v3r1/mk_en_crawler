BELGRADE, Serbia -- NATO has never asked or recommended that Serbia downsize its army, NATO Director of Force Planning Frank Boland said on Saturday (October 27th) at a NATO Assembly seminar in Belgrade.
Boland said Serbia could have as big an army as it could afford, though he noted in the past few years, the government has invested little in its armed forces.
He also praised the progress of defence reforms in Serbia, but said the laws on defence and the army have not yet been adopted.
In other news Sunday, the steering committee of the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) unanimously supported a declaration that opposes Serbia's membership in NATO.
According to the DSS, military neutrality remains the best way to guarantee the country's sovereignty, integrity, and independence.

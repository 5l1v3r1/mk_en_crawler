PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovo Police (KP) and EULEX signed a technical agreement Friday (October 2nd) on information exchanges. 
Assistant director for investigations at the KP, Kadri Arifi, said the agreement does not violate the security of police information, noting EULEX will have no direct access to the police database. 
Reportedly, the agreement stipulates that EULEX can use the information for investigational purposes only, in specific cases, which are being investigated either by EULEX police or the KP. 
The agreement follows a police protocol on co-operation in cross-border crime, signed between the EULEX and Belgrade in September, which authorities in Pristina strongly oppose.
In other news, EULEX's legal component said on Sunday that human remains have been unearthed in what is believed to be a mass grave in the Malisheva/Malishevo region in central Kosovo. 
The identity of the victims is unclear.

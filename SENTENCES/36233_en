NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktash on Wednesday (3 March) accused the Greek Cypriot side of failing to make constructive proposals and rejecting those by the Turkish Cypriot side.
Denktash confirmed that his delegation turned down a Greek Cypriot proposal stating that land to be handed over to Greek Cypriots in the north should be immediately transferred to the UN instead.
Meanwhile, Greek Cypriot media suggested that UN officials are working on a new version of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's peace plan that might incorporate proposals by both sides.

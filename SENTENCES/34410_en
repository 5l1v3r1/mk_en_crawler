BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Dragoljub Micunovic, the presidential candidate of Serbia's ruling DOS coalition, reportedly may withdraw his name due to internal political disagreements, Though he leads in opinion polls, coalition members told Belgrade-based radio B92 on Saturday (18 October) that Micunovic is disappointed that some within the coalition seem to oppose his candidacy.
The elections committee is expected to confirm in a week whether the presidential vote will be held on 16 November.

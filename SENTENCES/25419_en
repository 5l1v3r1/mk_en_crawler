PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Belgrade will be consulted in implementing a strategy to establish law and order in northern Kosovo, International Civilian Office (ICO) head Pieter Feith was quoted as saying on Sunday (January 24th). 
The ICO has already established nine international working groups to help with the strategy, which aims to make Kosovo institutions functional in an area dominated by Serb parallel structures. 
"We believe that citizens deserve better services. 
We would like to strengthen the rule of law. 
We want to improve social and economic conditions for the citizens in the north. 
We believe that the establishment of a municipality in the north would offer more autonomy and rights for communities," Feith said. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, however, said recently that Belgrade plays no part in implementation. 
At a cabinet meeting Saturday, he instead urged ministers to work harder at making the strategy a reality.

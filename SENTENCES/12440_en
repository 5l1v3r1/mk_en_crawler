SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski voiced concern Tuesday (8 March) over possible risks to his country following the UN war crimes tribunal's indictment of Ramush Haradinaj.
Crvenkovski's spokesman, Valentin Nikolovski, said the president has asked domestic security services to follow the situation closely.
Nikolovski added that Macedonia hopes the indictment will not affect regional stability and that the international community and Kosovo institutions will successfully deal with the situation.

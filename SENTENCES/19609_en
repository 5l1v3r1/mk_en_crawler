ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission is not going to start talks on the justice and home affairs chapters of the acquis next month, according to a document quoted by Croatian media on Sunday (September 23rd).
It says a satisfactory level of reform has not been achieved, and that corruption at senior levels â as evidenced by a recent scandal involving the Croatian Privatisation Fund (HFP) -- remains a problem.
Charges have been filed against three HFP vice presidents, and other high-level officials -- including Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec â have come under suspicion.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government received permission Friday (February 12th) to appeal to the Australian High Court a decision by a lower court to release former Serb paramilitary leader Dragan Vasiljkovic. 
No date has been set for the appeal. 
Vasiljkovic is charged in Croatia with involvement in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and similar activity in 1993 in the southern village of Bruska. 
An Australian court concluded last September that Vasiljkovic could not be extradited to Croatia to stand trial for war crimes, because he would face "a substantial or real chance of prejudice".

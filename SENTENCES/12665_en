BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn kicks off a three-day visit to Turkey Sunday (6 March) for talks with top leaders and political figures.
The focus will be on issues related to the start of accession talks, scheduled for 3 October.
Turkey's bid for membership has opened an historic page in European history, Rehn said before his departure, praising the reforms made so far and urging the implementation of the remaining requirements.
He noted that Turkey is expected to fulfil a pledge to sign a new customs agreement with the EU, a move which is considered a step towards recognition of Cyprus.

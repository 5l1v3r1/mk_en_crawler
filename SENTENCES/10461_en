BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt urged Serbia-Montenegro on Thursday (18 November) to make a breakthrough decision on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In an interview with the state news agency Tanjug, Polt stressed that such a decision would boost Serbia-Montenegro's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures and would be in the interest both of Belgrade and the international community.
In a separate statement Thursday, Serbian President Boris Tadic said he is awaiting a concrete stance by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on the issue of co-operation.
He warned that failure to resolve this problem would jeopardise Serbia's future.

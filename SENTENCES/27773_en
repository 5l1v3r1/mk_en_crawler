PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The final results of last Sunday's elections for Rahovec/Orahovac mayor show that two different candidates than originally predicted will head to a run-off vote in December. 
The Central Elections Commission (CEC) announced on Wednesday (November 24th) that Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) candidate Xhelal Canziba is dropping out of the race. 
Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) candidate Smajl Latifi will face the confirmed winner in the first round, Ibrahim Kryeziu from the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK). 
The surprising results came after the count of votes in three polling stations that were not included in the preliminary results. 
The AAK complained to the CEC, arguing that 457 votes were taken away from the party. 
The CEC determined a date for the run-off, but it may take place one week after the December 12th snap elections.

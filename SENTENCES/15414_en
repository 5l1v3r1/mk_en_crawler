SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The second round of presidential elections was held on Sunday (October 29th), pitting incumbent Georgi Parvanov against Volen Siderov of the ultranationalist Attack coalition. 
In the first round, held a week ago, Parvanov won over 64% of the vote. 
But turnout was well below the required threshold, robbing him of an outright victory. 
Siderov won 21% of the vote last week. 
In the runoff, the candidate who receives the most votes wins, regardless of turnout.

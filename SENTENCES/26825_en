BUCHAREST, Romania -- Station Inspector Raimi Mohd Yusof of the Singapore police told a Romanian court Wednesday (March 10th) that he recognised a former diplomat as the driver of a vehicle involved in two hit-and-run incidents that left one person dead and two injured in December. 
The ex-diplomat, Silviu Ionescu, was driving the embassy car that caused the incidents. 
Ionescu, 49, insists the vehicle had been stolen -- a claim that Yusof dismissed in court. 
Removed from his post, Ionescu faces criminal charges in Romania in connection with the case.

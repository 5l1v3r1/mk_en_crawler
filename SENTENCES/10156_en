PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Kosovo Election Commission has ordered a full recount of the 660,000 ballots cast last weekend.
OSCE mission chief Pascal Fieschi said Friday (29 October) that a recount would be the most reliable way to eliminate errors.
It is not clear to what extent the recount would affect the final outcome of the parliamentary elections.
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic returned from a visit to Germany on Saturday said he would announce whether he believes Kosovo Serb representatives should assume assigned seats in the Kosovo Parliament after talks with members of the local Serb community.
Tadic was one of the few politicians in Belgrade who encouraged Serb participation in the vote.

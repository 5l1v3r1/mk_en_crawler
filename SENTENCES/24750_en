SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency announced plans Monday (January 5th) to send a small military contingent to join the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan later this year.
A total of ten officers will join the German and Danish contingents in the country.
"The decision, which is subject to approval by the parliament, will be another step to Euro-Atlantic integration," a joint statement noted.

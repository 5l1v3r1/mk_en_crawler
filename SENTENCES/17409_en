SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's divided right-wing opposition have indicated they might consolidate, after none of three rightist parties -- the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) and the Union of Free Democrats -- won seats in Sunday's European Parliament vote. 
All the three parties fell short of the 5.56% threshold, which resulted in the resignations of UDF leader Petar Stoyanov and DSB leader Ivan Kostov. 
Both hinted that their exits open the possibility of consolidation under new leadership.
In other news Tuesday, President Georgi Parvanov, former leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), criticised the ruling coalition, especially the senior government ally BSP, for its showing in Sunday's election. 
The newly formed GERB party of populist Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov edged out BSP and a junior government partner, the predominantly ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms. 
Parvanov said these results and the very low voter turnout demonstrate the need to change how the political system functions.

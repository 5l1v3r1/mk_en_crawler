TIRANA, Albania -- Rrogozhina Prison director Nazmi Totraku was sacked on Wednesday (May 13th) amid a scandal reported by a private TV station. 
An investigative show revealed that prisoners could "buy" freedom over the course of several days by paying 100 euros a day. 
Cameras rolled as a prison driver made the deal on behalf of Totraku.

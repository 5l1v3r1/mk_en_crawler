TIRANA, Albania -- The new government intends to hold open cabinet meetings to boost transparency, but needs the votes of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) to adopt such a law, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Thursday (September 17th).
Earlier in the day, his government was sworn in.
Berisha chaired the first cabinet meeting, where he again urged the SP-led opposition to stop its boycott and return to parliament.
The SP insists the June 28th general election was manipulated and refuses to back down, despite calls from Brussels that such political debate should take place in parliament.

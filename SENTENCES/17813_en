PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Divisions reportedly are cropping up within the province's largest party, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK).
At issue are disputes between the newly elected LDK leader Fatmir Sejdiu, who is also Kosovo's president, and a faction led by former Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci.
Local media reports suggest that a dispute with Sejdiu prompted Daci and his supporters to skip the LDK general council's session Tuesday (December 19th), when new five deputy leaders and other senior officials were elected.

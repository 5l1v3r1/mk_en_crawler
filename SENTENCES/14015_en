BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The authorities in Belgrade are firmly committed to arresting Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said in an interview with Reuters, published Monday (14 October). 
He again denied reports that the army was protecting the fugitive but admitted there are "rotten apples" within the military. 
Mladic's arrest by year's end is crucial to Belgrade's talks on an Association and Stabilisation Agreement with the EU.
Separately Monday, a spokesman for the Republika Srpska police denied media reports that negotiations were under way on the voluntary surrenders of Mladic and fellow Bosnian Serb fugitive Stojan Zupljanin.

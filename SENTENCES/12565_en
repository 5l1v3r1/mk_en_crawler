ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Parliament's (EP) rapporteur on Turkey, Dutch deputy Camiel Eurlings, criticised the Turkish government Wednesday (6 April), saying there has been a serious slowdown in reforms related to EU accession. 
Talking to the Dutch media, Eurlings said Turkey was moving "in the wrong direction" and must quickly address the issue if it wants to avoid major problems ahead of EU negotiations, scheduled to begin on 3 October.
In other news, the Greek government confirmed Wednesday that Foreign Minister Petros Moliviatis will visit Turkey next week. 
Bilateral and regional issues will dominate the agenda.
On Tuesday, parliament's committee for foreign relations discussed, for the first time, the Armenian genocide issue.

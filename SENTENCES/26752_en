SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors have charged a suspected crime boss in connection with Tuesday's (January 5th) murder of radio show host Bobi Tsankov.
Krasimir Marinov, known as "The Big Margin", was arrested hours after the high-profile killing, and has since been charged with incitement to murder.
Police are still looking for his younger brother, Nikolai Marinov.
Tsankov, who reported on the mafia, was gunned down on a crowded Sofia street in broad daylight.
His two guards were critically wounded.
Since his book, alleging links between mafia figures and businessmen, was published in November, Tsankov had complained of receiving death threats.

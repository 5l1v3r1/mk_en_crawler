BELGRADE, Serbia -- Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic was officially elected permanent leader of G17 Plus, a junior ruling coalition partner, during the party's convention on Saturday (9 September). 
Dinkic had been heading G17 Plus since May, when then party chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus resigned from all posts, citing the government's failure to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal and the freezing of Serbia's EU talks. 
After his election Saturday, Dinkic urged all parties of the democratic bloc to embrace a set of national priorities: economic development, speedier European integration, compromise over Kosovo and urgent adoption of a new constitution.

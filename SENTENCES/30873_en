ATHENS, Greece -- Police on Wednesday (February 9th) announced a 1m-euro reward for any information leading to the capture of Vassilis Paleokostas, a notorious bank robber who has twice managed to escape Athens' most heavily guarded prison by helicopter. 
Paleokostas, 45, is also suspected of terrorism. 
His fingerprints were found on a device that exploded at the Ministry of Citizens Protection in June 2010, killing a ministerial aide.

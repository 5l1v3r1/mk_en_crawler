BUCHAREST, Romania -- The parliamentary commission overseeing the activities of security agencies is divided over a recent decision by the National Council for Studying the Securitate Archives to declassify the files of politicians.
Ruling coalition partners generally welcomed the decision but the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) has voiced reservations.
PSD deputy Ion Stan, who serves as the parliamentary panel's secretary, said on Thursday (3 August) he is concerned the decision would violate the national security law.

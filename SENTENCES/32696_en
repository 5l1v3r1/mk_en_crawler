SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The year was a very good one for Macedonia, according to officials from the international community, who held a joint news conference Wednesday (18 December) in Skopje.
They agreed that September's fair and democratic parliamentary elections were the highlight of the year, adding that the next major task for the country would be preparation for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
Meanwhile, Defence Ministry spokesman Marjan Gjurovski announced that the government has decided, beginning in January, to reduce conscript military service from nine to six months.
He noted too that the army is recruiting junior officers of ethnic Albanian origin in accordance with plans to integrate minorities in the army.
In other news, the leader of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, Ljubco Georgievski, will not attend next week's meeting of the signatories of the Ohrid peace accord, to protest what his party calls the "revival of the totalitarian regime".
Representatives of the international community condemned VMRO-DPMNE's decision.

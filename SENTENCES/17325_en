SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement Thursday (April 26th), the French Supreme Command announced it will downsize its troops in EUFOR, from 450 to 140 by the end of the year. 
The move is in line with an EU decision last month to slash the number of EUFOR personnel in light of improved security in BiH. 
Ahead of that restructuring, the Sarajevo-based EUFOR conducted a full operational capability exercise Wednesday at the Pazaric barracks.

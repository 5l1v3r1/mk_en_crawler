ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur for Croatia Hannes Swoboda believes that Zagreb's accession talks could be wrapped up in the first half of next year. 
In a draft report quoted by local media Friday (November 26th), he notes that accession negotiations could be completed by then if the country maintains its current determination to implement necessary reforms, particularly in strengthening the judiciary and public administration, as well as ensuring full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal and continuing with the privatisation of the shipyard sector. 
The report is due to be submitted for discussion by the EP's foreign affairs committee Tuesday.

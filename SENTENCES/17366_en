ANKARA, Turkey -- Officials say a suicide bomber carried out Tuesday's (May 22nd) attack that killed six people and left nearly 100 wounded in Ankara. 
He was identified as Guven Akkus, 28, a former member of an organisation called the Turkish Union of Revolutionary Communists. 
Ankara Governor Kemal Onal said on Wednesday that the plastic explosives used in the attack at a shopping mall were similar to those used by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but the group has denied responsibility for the bombing. 
Authorities in Adana reported on Wednesday that they had arrested a man and a woman who were found in possession of 5kg of explosives. 
It appears the woman was planning to blow herself up at a location in the city.
In other news, a suspected PKK landmine in southeastern Turkey killed five soldiers and wounded four others Thursday. 
The military says the explosive device was detonated by remote control.

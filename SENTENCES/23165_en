TIRANA, Albania -- The EU should accept countries from the Western Balkans, particularly Croatia, before all 27 EU members ratify the Lisbon Treaty, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, said on Friday (October 31st). 
His country assumes the EU's rotating presidency in January. 
Speaking to a gathering of Albanian diplomats in Tirana, Schwarzenberg said his country will advocate the EU's expansion to the southeast because it knows how much NATO and EU membership has helped the Czechs. 
France, Germany and some other countries have argued that EU enlargement should be suspended until all members ratify the Lisbon Treaty.

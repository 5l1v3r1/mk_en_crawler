ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prosecutors have indicted 69 suspected al-Qaeda members for the deadly November suicide bombings in Istanbul. 
The prosecution's 127-page indictment seeks life sentences for the five suspected ringleaders. 
They are due to appear before the court Monday (31 May).
Meanwhile, the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party warned on Friday that it might end its unilateral ceasefire on 1 June if the government does not pull its troops out of southeast Turkey. 
Authorities have stepped up their operations against the terrorist group in recent months.
Also Friday, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed a series of controversial amendments to the country's education laws, claiming they would undermine the secular character of the educational system. 
Most controversial is a measure that would open up the public service system to graduates of state-run religious high schools.

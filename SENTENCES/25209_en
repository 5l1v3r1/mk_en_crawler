BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur for Croatia Hannes Swoboda said on Wednesday (January 27th) that Zagreb's accession to the EU in January 2012 would be difficult.
Swoboda said that scenario leaves little time for every EU member to ratify the accession treaty.
More likely, he said, is mid-2012 or early 2013.
Swoboda also indicated that accession negotiations may drag into early 2011 rather than ending this year, as Zagreb hopes.
Swoboda spoke to reporters after the EP foreign affairs committee approved a resolution on Croatia's EU-related progress.

ATHENS, Greece -- The sale of short-term bonds Tuesday (April 13th) raised 1.56 billion euros amid stronger than expected investor interest. 
This was the first debt sale since Sunday, when eurozone finance ministers agreed to activate a 30 billion euro financial aid plan should Greece need it. 
The yield on 12-month bonds was 4.85%, compared to 4.55% for six-month notes. 
Economists say the sale should help ease immediate investor concern about Greece's financial health.

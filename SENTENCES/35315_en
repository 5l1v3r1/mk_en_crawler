BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two witnesses Wednesday (21 April) rejected the police version of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination, saying they heard three shots from two directions. 
Appearing before a special court in Belgrade, driver Aleksandar Bjelic and bodyguard Drazen Nastic disputed investigators' claims that only two shots had been fired from a single direction. 
In a second day of testimony, Milan Veruovic, the head of Djindjic's security detail, backed their account of the shooting. 
He was the first witness to claim that two snipers had been involved in the March 2003 assassination.

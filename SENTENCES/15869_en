BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN special envoy for Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari's mandate has been extended to June 2007, spokesperson Hua Jiang confirmed Thursday (October 19th). 
However, the extension is of a technical character and is not a signal that the Kosovo talks will be extended further, she said. 
The international Contact Group has said a solution to the Kosovo issue should be found by the end of this year.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said in an interview with national radio on Friday (December 11th) that Bulgaria is leading talks with the US to accept some inmates from Guantanamo prison. 
He added that the government has received a letter from the US with the request, but no decision has been taken yet. 
"Bulgaria's participation would be small and we would not accept people who might pose a threat to our national security," Tsvetanov added, stressing that the issue would be discussed in parliament. 
Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that if Bulgaria decides to host an inmate from the facility, this would be a strong gesture of solidarity and co-operation between Europe and the US.

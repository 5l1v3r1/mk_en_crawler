ATHENS, Greece -- A court in Athens on Saturday (February 20th) ruled that a strike by the country's customs officials is illegal.
The strike, which entered its fifth day Saturday, has caused fuel supply problems across the country.
Customs officials are protesting a government decision to freeze their wages and cut their bonuses as part of austerity measures to overcome the country's financial crisis.
On Friday, the protestors vowed to extend the action through Wednesday, when a nationwide strike is planned.
Also Friday, taxi drivers staged a strike, snarling traffic in the capital as hundreds of chanting protestors marched behind a line of cabs to the finance ministry.

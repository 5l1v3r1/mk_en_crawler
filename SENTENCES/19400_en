BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Dragan Jocic acknowledged on Sunday (August 26th) that Kosovo Albanians may unilaterally declare independence after the new talks on Kosovo's final status end in December. 
Jocic, citing US support for former UN envoy Martti Ahtissari's plan for supervised independence, suggested Washington would back such a declaration. 
He urged the international community to make clear to Kosovo politicians that any unilateral proclamation of independence is illegal.
In other news, Kosovo's parliament holds its autumn plenary session Monday. 
Members will focus on the judicial reform law, as well as the law on energy sector regulatory panels.

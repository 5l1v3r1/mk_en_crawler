BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's democratic parties failed to strike a compromise on the new cabinet during their meeting Monday (26 January).
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), Democratic Party (DS), Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia and G17 Plus will continue talks Tuesday.
According to local sources, DSS is calling for a step-by-step approach while DS wants a final decision.
Details are still sketchy, but DSS generally supports a minority government while DS favours a majority government.
In other news, Belgrade prosecutors have charged eight men with the murder of at least 192 Croatian prisoners of war at a farm near Vukovar in 1991.
Their trial, before the special local war crimes court, is expected to begin in March.

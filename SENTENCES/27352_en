ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz met on Friday (May 28th) with Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor to discuss Croatia's level of co-operation with The Hague.
He urged the country to do more to boost the tribunal's investigations, reiterating that Croatia's co-operation is an essential part of the political criteria for EU accession.
General issues of co-operation aren't a problem, Brammertz indicated, but supplying requested documents is.
"We still think there are a number of investigation avenues that can be pursued and that more results can be achieved," he told reporters after the meeting.
Brammertz will present his assessment, crucial to Zagreb's EU bid, to the UN Security Council on June 14th.

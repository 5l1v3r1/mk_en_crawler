SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling strongly criticised on Tuesday (13 June) the continued failure of the BiH Parliament to meet for work, due to a boycott by deputies from Republika Srpska (RS). 
"This failure -- in a country where essential services are stretched or non-existent, where the condition of roads and houses and schools are appalling, and where whole families have to survive on 300 marks a month -- is nothing short of a slap in the face to the people of BiH", he said. 
The RS deputies have refused to attend parliament sessions for three weeks, demanding the establishment of a special commission to investigate the fate of Serbs from Sarajevo still missing since the BiH conflict.

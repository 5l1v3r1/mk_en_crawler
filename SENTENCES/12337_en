ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis said on Thursday (7 July) that the government is committed to adopting measures that would bring its large budget deficit under control.
Alogoskoufis said Athens is determined to bring the deficit below 3 per cent by the end of 2006, from 6.1 per cent at the end of 2004.
He admitted Greece faces many problems, particularly an overhaul of the pensions system.
His comment was in response to a report by the OECD that said Greece faces "huge challenges" in the years ahead.

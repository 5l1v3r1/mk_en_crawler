BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu on Thursday (27 January) condemned the wiretapping of journalists' phones, saying it amounted to "an attack on press freedom". 
Tariceanu promised a full investigation into revelations that the intelligence service had bugged the phones of two reporters suspected of spying.
Also Thursday, the government decided to lift the immunity of former ministers and state secretaries, in a bid to boost transparency. 
They can be now investigated without parliamentary approval.

ANKARA, Turkey -- An explosion on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline in eastern Turkey shut down supplies and caused a large spill late Wednesday (November 5th), according to media reports.
The incident occurred on a section of the pipeline in the south-eastern province of Sanliurfa.
Officials said a sudden loss of pressure likely caused the blast.
Separatist Kurdish rebels active in eastern and south-eastern Turkey have sabotaged gas and oil pipelines in the past as part of their armed campaign for Kurdish autonomy in the region.

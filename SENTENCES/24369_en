ATHENS, Greece -- Unknown attackers planted explosive devices in three cathedrals across Greece on Thursday (April 9th).
One went off inside the church of Agia Triada in Piraeus but caused no injuries.
Police defused two other devices, one inside the Athens Orthodox Cathedral near the tourist Plaka district and the other at Agia Sofia church in the northern city of Thessaloniki.
The bombs consisted of gasoline canisters and a timing device.
A local newspaper and a radio station received telephone warnings about the bombs and notified police.

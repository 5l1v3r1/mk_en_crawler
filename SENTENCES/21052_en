SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement Friday (February 1st), BiH's central bank (CBBH) reacted harshly to attempts by Republika Srpska's (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik to interfere in its work.
The CBBH was angered when Dodik said he would initiate proceedings to return the profit made by the bank to the entities.
The CBBH reminded Dodik that its establishment and operations are spelled out in the Dayton Peace Accord, which says the Central Bank shall be entirely independent from the FBiH, the RS, or any public agency or authority in the pursuit of its objective execution of its tasks and shall take no instructions from any other subject.

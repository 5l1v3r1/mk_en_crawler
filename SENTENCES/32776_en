KONFIN, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Tonino Picula and his Yugoslav counterpart Goran Svilanovic signed a protocol Tuesday (10 December) on the disputed Prevlaka peninsula. 
Under its terms, the peninsula is to remain Croatian territory, but Yugoslavia will enjoy access to Montenegro's Kotor Bay, a major seaport and naval base. 
Navy ships will be able to sail through the channel leading into the bay, but will not be allowed to stop or conduct military activity in the area. 
The two countries pledged to keep the peninsula demilitarised and to mount joint naval patrols. 
The protocol was seen as a step towards reaching a final agreement on the future of this territory, and was praised by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
The mandate of the UN Mission of Observers in Prevlaka expires Sunday.

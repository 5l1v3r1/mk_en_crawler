BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Polling stations opened across Serbia on Sunday (16 November) in the republic's third attempt in just over a year to elect a president.
The chief contenders for the post are Dragoljub Micunovic, who is supported by several reformist parties, and ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic.
The Belgrade-based Centre for Free Elections and Democracy cited some voting irregularities -- not all the polling stations in Kraljevo opened on time, for example.
A survey published on Wednesday found that slightly more than 50 per cent of the respondents planned to vote, the threshold required to make the election results legal.
If neither candidate receives the required 50 per cent of the vote, a runoff would be held in two weeks.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) adopted on Wednesday (May 26th) a recommendation to lift the visa regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The recommendation, though positive, is conditional, and requires both countries to address a number of unresolved issues.
BiH will have to boost efforts against corruption and crime, create an electronic police database and harmonise domestic criminal codes with those in the region.
The EC is requiring Albania to spell out a reintegration strategy for returning refugees, ensure effective application of the 2009 law on confiscating criminal assets, and boost efforts against organised crime and corruption.
Both countries hope to wrap up the process and actually obtain visa-free travel for their citizens later this year.

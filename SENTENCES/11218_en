SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) endorsed the technical parameters of the integral ballot for the 25 June parliamentary elections late Saturday (28 May), two days after the deadline. 
The delay was due to strong controversy within the CEC about the draft model of the ballot, as well as the government's latest decision on administration of election expenses. 
Some of the commission members also objected to the cabinet's plans for an "election lottery", as an incentive to boost turnout during the parliamentary vote. 
They reportedly conditioned their support for the ballot on rejection of the lottery.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sonja Karadzic, daughter of Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, told Banja Luka's Alternative TV (ATV) on Sunday (September 16th) that she had no idea how her brother Sasa would return to BiH after he was expelled from Serbia.
Sasa was detained during an ID check in Serbia on Friday.
Police discovered he was using false documents identifying himself as a Serbian citizen and gave him three days to leave the country.
Sonja told ATV her brother had no Bosnian passport because he was staying in Serbia with an ID he had been using for the past eight years.
Believing he was a citizen of Serbia, he never applied for Bosnian citizenship, Sonja explained.
Their father has been a fugitive for more than a decade.

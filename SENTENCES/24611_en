BELGRADE, Serbia -- Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said on Sunday (December 7th) he expects EULEX's key role in Kosovo to be implementing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's six-point plan.
He added that Kosovo's status issue should remain open until negotiators find a compromise.
"EULEX's staff will probably be deployed in their allocated places from December 9th, and they will replace UNMIK in the north of the region, but I think that activities in areas regarding the work in Serb-dominated areas will begin much later," Bogdanovic said in an interview with the daily Vecernje Novosti.
He added he expects EULEX to guarantee individual and property security, to protect cultural and religious heritage and to ensure transport security and the functioning of the customs service.
In other news, Micronesia is the latest country to recognise Kosovo's independence.
It is the 53rd of the 192 UN members to do so, according to a statement by Pristina on Friday.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A medical report presented to the UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (20 April) said Slobodan Milosevic has dangerously high blood pressure and is at serious risk of having a heart attack. 
The hearings were adjourned on Tuesday because of the defendant's poor health. 
A spokesman for the tribunal said the trial could proceed, as judges may allow court-appointed lawyers to examine witnesses.
In other news, Drago Nikolic, the chief of security of the Bosnian Serb Zvornik brigade, appeared before the UN court on Wednesday to plead not guilty to genocide charges. 
Soldiers from his brigade transported hundreds of Muslim detainees from the village of Orahovac to a nearby field where they were executed. 
Nikolic surrendered last month.

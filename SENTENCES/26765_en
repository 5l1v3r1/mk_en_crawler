SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko on Wednesday (January 6th) warned that a referendum proposed by the Republika Srpska (RS) government is not within the entity's constitutional authority and violates the Dayton Peace Agreement.
"The [Alliance of Independent Social Democrats] SNSD-led RS government is obliged to respect the Dayton Peace Agreement in its entirety and not challenge actions undertaken on the basis of Dayton and UN Security Council Resolutions," Inzko stressed.
He added that talk of any referendum is an effort to divert public attention from economic problems.
Late last month, the RS parliament rejected Inzko's decision to extend the mandates of foreign judges and prosecutors working in BiH's courts.
Lawmakers decided to hold a referendum on the issue after a new law on referendums is adopted.

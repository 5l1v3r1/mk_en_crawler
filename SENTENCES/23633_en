ANKARA, Turkey -- Five people suffered slight injuries in a small blast outside an internet cafe in Istanbul's Beyoglu district late Thursday (April 23rd), media reported. 
The victims were all young: two teenagers and three children aged four to nine. 
Bomb experts later found another device left on the same street. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
In other news, the trial of two Turkish and two German terrorism suspects began in Germany on Wednesday. 
The four allegedly plotted attacks on US and German targets in central Germany, in a plan foiled by authorities in 2007. 
German prosecutors say the suspects planned car bombings at pubs, discos and airports in several cities, including Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Stuttgart, Munich and Ramstein, where the US military has a large airbase.

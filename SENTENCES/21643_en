ANKARA, Turkey -- The government signed the protocol for Albania's membership in NATO on Wednesday (November 26th), a day after parliament ratified it. 
Turkish President Abdullah Gul assured visiting Albanian counterpart Bamir Topi of Ankara's support for Albania's integration. 
Both presidents agreed to exchange experiences in their individual integration processes, after Turkey and Albania signed the protocol on co-operation in the European integration process last year. 
Turkey is the ninth NATO country to ratify Albania's protocol for membership.

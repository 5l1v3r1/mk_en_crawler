SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov met with the country's top magistrates Friday (4 July) to discuss amendments to the judiciary act. 
Justice Minister Anton Stankov, Prosecutor General Nikola Filchev, Supreme Court of Cassation President Ivan Grigorov and Supreme Administrative Court President Vladislav Slavov took part in the meeting. 
The changes, which parliament approved Thursday, stipulate that the Supreme Judicial Council should elect the prosecutor general and the presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and Supreme Administrative Court by a two-thirds majority of all its members. 
But some experts say that could hamper the elections procedure and slow the work of the judiciary. 
Parvanov has 14 days to decide whether to veto the amendments or sign them into law.

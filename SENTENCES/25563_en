PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith says any potential changes in the cabinet are the sole responsibility of one man.
"This is very much the Prime Minister's [Hashim Thaci] responsibility and I am fully supportive of his efforts," Feith said on Tuesday (March 23rd).
Speculation regarding a possible government reshuffle has been going on for months, but no names of those expected to leave the cabinet have emerged.
Relations in the coalition between the ruling Democratic Party and the Democratic League have deteriorated since the last local elections in November 2009, which confirmed that Thaci's party is the most powerful in Kosovo.

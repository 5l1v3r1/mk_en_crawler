PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu reiterated on Monday (July 12th) that Pristina and Belgrade could hold talks on any issue except Kosovo's status.
In his annual address to parliament, he urged Serbia to distance itself from groups inciting violence in northern Kosovo and called on the EU to condition Belgrade's integration with changing its policy towards the former province.
Sejdiu also described any notion of changing borders in the Balkans as dangerous.
He urged Pristina institutions to step up the fight against crime and corruption and to engage more actively in fulfilling the criteria for EU and NATO integration, and for Kosovo's inclusion in the EU's visa liberalisation regime.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court Monday (December 14th) green-lighted the start of legal proceedings against former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic and his former assistant Ivo Bacic. 
The anti-corruption office, USKOK, charged the two in late October with abuse of power over a 2004 procurement deal involving military trucks. 
According to prosecutors, the contract cost the state millions of kunas. 
The court confirmed the indictment, which means the trial could start in two months at the latest. 
Roncevic, who has been stripped of his immunity as a lawmaker, said he will be able to prove at trial that the accusations against him are groundless.

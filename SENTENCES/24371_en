MOSCOW, Russia -- Russia intends to take back a number of companies abroad that were once the property of the former Soviet Union, including Bulgarian cigarette maker Bulgartabac, Vladimir Kozhin, head of Russia's Presidential Property Management Department, said on Thursday (April 9th). 
"We are investigating ... 
and if we find out that the company was once ours, but in a not very legal way has come into foreign hands, we will launch a procedure for its return," Kozhin said. 
Russia has repeatedly raised the question of Bulgartabac's ownership. 
The Soviet Union acquired it as reparations after World War II.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt reiterated her commitment Thursday (16 June) to wrapping up judicial sector reforms by 2007.
She added that the focus would be improving the efficiency and organisation of courts and reducing the percentage of unsolved cases.
To that end, she plans to shorten the appeals process and to allow the delivery of court documents by e-mail.

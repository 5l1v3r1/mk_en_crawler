The SAC welcomed the resumption of political dialogue and parliament's commitment to securing political support for a pro-European agenda. 
It also stressed that implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement is key to Macedonia's EU integration bid. 
The SAC, an EU panel that monitors the progress of Macedonia's EU bid, praised the level of political will in Macedonia for fighting organised crime. 
At the same time, it called for implementation of planned judicial reforms.

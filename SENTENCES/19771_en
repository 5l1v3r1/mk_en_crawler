SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Military Committee Chairman General Ray Henault met Thursday (September 20th) with Macedonian Army Chief of General Staff Miroslav Stojanovski.
Henault described Macedonia as a very good candidate for membership, but said its accession must take into account progress in all areas.
He urged ongoing reforms to continue in light of the April 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest.
On Friday, Henault's delegation is expected to meet with President Branko Crvenkovski and other officials.
On Thursday, Crvenkovski met with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski to discuss a series of pressing issues, such as filling some vacant ambassadors' posts, the situation in Kosovo and the longstanding dispute with Greece over Macedonia's name.
Despite differences in some areas, both described the meeting as constructive.

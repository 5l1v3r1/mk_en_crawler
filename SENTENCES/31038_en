SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign ministers of Slovenia and Bulgaria Samuel Zbogar and Nikolay Mladenov met on Monday (March 7th) with members of the BiH tripartite presidency and leaders of local political parties to discuss EU membership. 
Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger was expected but had to cancel his trip due to illness. 
Zbogar and Mladenov said that BiH should fulfil three conditions before it submits its EU membership application: amend its electoral law as recommended by the European Court of Human Rights, approve a law on state aid and pass a law on holding a nationwide population census. 
The two diplomats expressed optimism that the three conditions will be met shortly after the new governments are formed.

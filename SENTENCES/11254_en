BELGRADE, Serbian-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic will travel to Brussels on 3 March to meet with EU and NATO officials. 
His talks with EU security chief Javier Solana will focus on Podgorica's proposal that Serbia and Montenegro form a commonwealth of independent states. 
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica rejected the proposal earlier this week. 
Solana was scheduled to travel to Belgrade last month, but cancelled the visit, saying that the country had not made sufficient progress in co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

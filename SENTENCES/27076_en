SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said on Thursday (December 3rd) that both his country and those in the EU are concerned about the situation in BiH. 
He reiterated that the country's political leaders must make tough decisions that show NATO and the EU that BiH is ready to join their ranks. 
Steinberg met in Sarajevo with leaders of seven main political parties included in the so-called Butmir process, which aims to end the political stalemate and bring BiH closer to European and Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Steinberg urged the party leaders to implement reforms as soon as possible.

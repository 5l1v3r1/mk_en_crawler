TIRANA, Albania -- The government announced on Thursday (January 8th) that it is not continuing its economy-monitoring agreement with the IMF.
Instead, the mission will have a limited monitoring role regarding two or three main economic parameters.
The agreement ends the IMF's 17-year mission in Albania.
Finance Minister Ridvan Bode said Albanian institutions have achieved the necessary maturity to manage the country's finances.
Yet the IMF has warned that the effects of the global financial crisis will hit Albania in this first quarter of 2009.

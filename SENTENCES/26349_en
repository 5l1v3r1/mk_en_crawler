BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic on Saturday (September 12th) urged a wide national consensus on political and economic reforms needed for Serbia to make progress in its EU bid.
"Very serious and difficult reforms and a lot of work are ahead in order for Serbia to be able to enter the porch of the EU as a stable country with a stable economy," Tadic said at a Democratic Party (DS) meeting in Belgrade.
"All this requires measures that need the wide support of the citizens, the coalition partners and the opposition."
On Friday, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said that Belgrade will officially submit its EU accession request by the end of this year.
"Serbia has no other political alternative," Jeremic said.

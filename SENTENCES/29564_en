BUCHAREST, Romania -- The IMF will release the next tranche of a 20 billion-euro loan to Romania when the government meets conditions agreed upon during a just-completed two week evaluation mission by the Fund.
Jeffrey Franks, head of that mission, said on Monday (November 1st) that the nearly 900m-euro installment could be released by the middle of January.
Among the conditions Franks cited are the final approval of reforms in pensions and public sector pay, and reduction of payments in arrears.
The Fund's decision followed a series of weekend meetings with senior officials, including President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc.
The talks were held amid media reports that Romania may be unable to meet Fund requirements to receive the next tranche of the aid that was agreed in 2009.
Basescu rejected such statements as "absurd." (AFP - 01/11/10;

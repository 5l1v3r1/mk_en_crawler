SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic arrived on Wednesday (November 11th) in Banja Luka for the first time since her release from a Swedish prison late last month. 
She had served two-thirds of her 11-year sentence for crimes against humanity. 
Plavsic, who currently lives in Belgrade, came to Republika Srpska to see friends and visit her mother's grave. 
In 2003, Plavsic was convicted by The Hague war crimes tribunal after pleading guilty to a single count of persecution, in connection with her role in an ethnic cleansing campaign aimed at driving Croats and Muslims out of Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia during the 1990's.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Greek counterpart George Papandreou spoke by phone Monday (April 26th), both saying they are willing to resolve the long-standing name dispute as soon as possible.
According to a press release from the Macedonian government, both expressed readiness to hold direct meetings in the near future.
But Gruevski told Papandreou he will not be participating in a conference organised by The Economist a month from now in Athens.
Meanwhile, EU envoy to Macedonia Erwan Fouere on Monday urged both Skopje and Athens to use the time until the next European Council in June to find a solution to the name row.
Representatives of Macedonia's ruling VMRO-DPMNE said on Monday that UN mediator Matthew Nimetz is expected to come up with a new set of ideas to resolve the problem.
They added that if the suggestion is acceptable, it will be submitted to a public referendum.
Gruevski said at the weekend that if "Republic of Northern Macedonia" is officially proposed as the name to be used internationally, he would vote against it in a referendum.

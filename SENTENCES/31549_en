SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US European Command Deputy Commander Gen Charles Wald arrived Friday (18 April) for a series of meetings, in light of Bulgaria's support of the US-led operation in Iraq. 
Meanwhile, Army Chief of Staff Gen Nikola Kolev announced that Bulgaria will send peacekeeping troops to Iraq next month.
Earlier this week, the defence ministry said the United States had asked Bulgaria to contribute a peacekeeping force, but saw no need for the anti-chemical and anti-biological unit originally tapped to take part in the war. 
Kolev said an infantry unit with patrolling functions would be deployed by the end of May.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The police on Friday (July 31st) charged former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic and Interior Ministry State Secretary Ivo Bacic in relation to the so-called "truck affair". 
The two men are suspected of manipulating a tender involving the supply of 39 military trucks five years ago, and signing an unfavourable contract causing a loss of nearly 4.6m euros. 
Charges against Bacic -- the highest ranking police official to be arrested in Croatia -- were dismissed. 
Roncevic, who is currently a lawmaker, told parliament on Saturday that this is a political process, and rejected all charges against him.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Ivo Josipovic and his visiting Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic agreed on Wednesday (November 24th) to continue the rapprochement and reconciliation policy between their countries. 
They noted the progress made in the return of refugees, and said that shedding light on the fate of missing persons from the 1991-1995 war is a priority issue. 
Experts from the two countries will start work on organising a donor conference in the first half of 2011 to deal with housing problems facing Serb refugees, they said. 
Josipovic and Tadic reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the EU integration and voiced mutual support in their accession process.

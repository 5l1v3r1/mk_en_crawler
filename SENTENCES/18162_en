TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha participated in a conference on developing domestic energy resources Thursday (April 12th) and said the energy sector is a government priority.
He added that a new group of experts has been appointed to work on energy projects.
The country has been battling severe power shortages due to a lack of rain for hydropower generation and soaring domestic consumption.
Tirana routinely has power cuts of up to six hours a day.
In villages, the cuts are even longer.

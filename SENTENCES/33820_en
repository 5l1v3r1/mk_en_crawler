TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition boycotted parliament Thursday (20 November), blocking its work. 
Sali Berisha, the head of the opposition Democratic Party, insisted President Alfred Moisiu either resolve an ongoing political dispute over filling two cabinets posts or step down. 
"The president should guarantee respect of institutions and intervene to resolve the actual situation. 
Otherwise, he should resign from his post," said Berisha.

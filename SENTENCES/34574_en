ANKARA, Turkey -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenther Verheugen warned on Wednesday (1 October) that Cyprus would have veto power at the EU summit in December 2004 and could prevent the initiation of accession negotiations with Turkey if the country does not co-operate with efforts to reunite the divided island. 
In an interview with CNN Turk, Verheugen stressed that Cyprus could resort to using its veto if no progress is reached in the negotiations by that time.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Stepan Mikic, chairman of the Central Election Commission (CEC), said on Thursday (October 4th) that the CEC will determine the date of presidential elections in Republika Srpska (RS) next week. 
He expects the vote to be held on December 9th. 
Incumbent Milan Jelic died of a heart attack Sunday. 
Without clear legal guidelines on how to elect a successor, Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic has assumed the duties temporarily. 
The Bosniak and Croat parties in the RS parliament oppose his appointment and demand that one of Jelic's two deputies becomes interim president.

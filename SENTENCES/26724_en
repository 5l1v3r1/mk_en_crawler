TIRANA, Albania -- A group of publicists and journalists met on Saturday (November 7th) in an effort to urge new freedom of speech standards in Albania.
They pointed out the "deterioration of free media climate" culminating in a businessman physically attacking a senior journalist last week.
Participants signed an agreement to pressure the government, parliament and the public to improve the standards in which media outlets are functioning.

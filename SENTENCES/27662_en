PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Government authorities have turned down proposals by the International Crises Group (ICG) regarding autonomy for northern Kosovo.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Thursday (August 26th) that Kosovo is an independent country, and that there will be no autonomy or territory exchange.
He added that Pristina completed everything it has to do with Serbia in 1999, and the international community did the same more recently by ruling in favour of Kosovo's independence declaration.
In a report Thursday, the ICG called on Pristina and Belgrade to start negotiations on unsolved issues, warning that unless this happens, conflicts may arise.
The document stated that in the wake of the July 22nd International Court of Justice's opinion, the EU and the US should facilitate dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia as soon as possible.
The ICG proposed three different solutions for northern Kosovo -- the Ahtisaari Plan, extended autonomy and territorial exchange.

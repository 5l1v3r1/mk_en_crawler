TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi has agreed to assume the role of mediator between the government and the opposition to end the ongoing political crisis, his office announced on Thursday (February 4th). 
A day earlier, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said he is ready to sit down with opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama if Topi organised the meeting without any preconditions. 
Opposition parties, led by the SP, have been boycotting the work of parliament since September, insisting on a thorough investigation into the June 2009 general elections.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government announced on Saturday (18 June) that Spanish experts are expected to assist in improving the utilisation of EU funding in Romania.
Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu and Spanish counterpart Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero agreed on the move during a meeting in Brussels that day.
Meanwhile Romania's rail traffic was completely blocked for four hours Monday morning, when all the trade unions backed a five-day strike by the national railway company.
The employees are demanding a 10 per cent salary hike.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The main board of Republika Srpska's (RS) main opposition Serb Democratic Party (SDS) will nominate party leader and incumbent RS President Dragan Cavic to run for a second mandate in the October general elections, it was said after the Saturday (24 June) session of the body.
SDS also decided to name Mladen Bosic as the party candidate for the post of the BiH presidency's Serb member.
The board members discussed the composition of the future party lists of candidates for seats in the RS Parliament, as well as the possibility for running in the elections for local assemblies in the Federation of BiH's cantons.
Separately, the Bosnian Serb government appointed Uros Pena as new head of the RS police on Friday.
His nomination was picked up amid a total of five short-listed candidacies in the recent competition for the position.
The RS police chief's seat has been vacant since 7 April, when Dragomir Andan resigned.

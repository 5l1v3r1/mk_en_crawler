BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR personnel raided the headquarters of the Republika Srpska fixed-line phone operator Telecom Srpske in Banja Luka on Friday (21 November).
The soldiers conducted a one-hour search of the premises and left without taking anything.
SFOR called it a routine inspection in which the staff of Telecom Srpske co-operated.
The NATO-led peacekeepers recently searched the company's regional centres in Bijeljina, Srbinje and Trebinje, seizing documents.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown is urging the BiH parliamentary powers to co-operate for the sake of the success of EU integration talks next year.
He warned that unless BiH meets the 16 conditions set under the Feasibility Study report released by the EC last week, Europe would simply say no.

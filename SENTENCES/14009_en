ATHENS, Greece -- The UNHCR's special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Juan Miguel Petit, called on Greek authorities Monday (14 November) to do more to improve the protection of children's rights. 
Wrapping up a six-day visit to the country, Petit noted that while Greece has made considerable progress in the field of human rights, the rights of minors remains an issue.

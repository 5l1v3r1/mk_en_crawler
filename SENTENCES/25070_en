PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A total of 22 Vetevendosje (Self Determination) movement members detained earlier this week were mistreated during their two days in custody, a lawyer representing them said on Thursday (August 27th). 
"All of them were in miserable condition and exhausted. 
One of them was very sick and has asked for medical help but it was not provided to him," said attorney Florije Drevina. 
The activists were arrested in Pristina on Tuesday for allegedly damaging 28 EULEX vehicles, to protest the announced protocol on police co-operation between the EU mission and Serbia. 
Prosecutors asked that they be held for 30 days, as "they might escape and affect the investigation process." Vetevendosje says the request is politically motivated.
In other news, Obilic police chief Sejdi Zeqiri was arrested on Thursday for suspected abuse of power and corruption. 
Suspended from duty, he will be detained for 48 hours.

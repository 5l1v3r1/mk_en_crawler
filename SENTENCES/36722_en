SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Replacement of the three Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) ministers in the Republika Srpska (RS) government is inevitable, says BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, who leads the junior government partner, Party of Democratic Progress (PDP).
In an interview with the FENA news agency Sunday (25 July), Ivanic acknowledged that BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic could in turn remove PDP state government ministers, but warned that such a move could lead to a government crisis and early parliamentary elections.
Ivanic's PDP and the senior RS government partner Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) say the three SDA members must leave their posts because of Paddy Ashdown's recent dismissal of 59 senior officials, including ones from SDS and PDP.

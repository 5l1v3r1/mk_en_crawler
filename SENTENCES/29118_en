BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dejan Stojadinovic, who assaulted opposition leader Velimir Ilic in February, was sentenced on Tuesday (April 6th) to two years in prison.
Stojadinovic was found guilty of deliberately striking Ilic while the politician was speaking to reporters during a street protest in downtown Belgrade.
Stojadinovic claims the verdict was politically motivated while Ilic's New Serbia party says the sentence was not tough enough.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Justice Minister Mihajlo Manevski asked the Serbian Justice Ministry on Thursday (January 18th) to extradite Stanislava Cocorovska-Poletan, who is suspected of organising the trafficking of nearly half a tonne of cocaine that Macedonian police seized at the Blace border crossing a couple of weeks ago.
Cocorovska-Poletan has been detained in Belgrade since January 13th, but denies all allegations, insisting Macedonian authorities fabricated them.
In other news Thursday, Macedonia's Anti-Corruption Commission and USAID signed a memorandum of understanding.
Under the accord, USAID will help draft anti-corruption legislation.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci announced on Sunday (November 21st) that teachers' salaries will be increased by 50% as of January 1st 2011. 
Thaci announced the news to representatives of the teachers' trade union, saying his decision is aimed at improving education. 
Skeptics however say it is just a campaign promise ahead of the December 12th snap elections. 
Economists have suggested the salary increase would cause budgetary problems, as it was not part of the mid-term strategy plan.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu says Romanian and US officials are negotiating on the deployment of US bases in the Balkan country.
In comments Thursday (25 August), Atanasiu said a memorandum, now being discussed by diplomats, would spell out the terms for the American deployment, part of a global realignment of US forces.
Washington is expected to set up small and flexible units in Bulgaria and Romania that would be closer to areas where conflicts might arise.

Albania's new cabinet, headed again by Sali Berisha, was sworn in on Thursday (September 17th) -- a few hours after parliament gave it the green light.
Before presenting the government's agenda, Berisha thanked voters for backing "the route of changes in the country and the realisation of the EU dream".
In his speech, he emphasised that economic and institutional reforms are needed for the country to make strides towards the EU.
At the meeting, Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) head Ilir Meta, who is currently foreign affairs minister, and second in command after Berisha, thanked the prime minister for "integrating the main objectives of [SMI] into the new programme".
According to Meta, reforms are needed in the social services, the health system and in education.
He says the coalition is capable of making those changes.
Apart from working together for the next four years, the parties agreed to join forces in the 2011 local election, and work towards further reforming the Electoral Code.
The new cabinet is coined the Government of Integration because one of its main objectives is EU integration.
Only one lawmaker voted against the new government, while the main opposition boycotted the session entirely, due to qualms over the country's June 28th election.
Citing irregularities and voter fraud, the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) describes the election as "not acceptable for a NATO member country".
Vote counting dragged on due to the SP allegations, but according to final results, the Democratic Party (DP) and its allies won half of the 140 seats in parliament.
The SMI held four crucial seats, which the DP needed for a victory.
The Socialists and their allies won 66 seats.
This is the second consecutive term for Berisha and his DP.

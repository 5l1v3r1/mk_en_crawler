SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Outgoing Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) President Borjana Kristo said on Friday (March, 18th) that she will not hand over her duties to newly elected President Zivko Budimir. 
He was elected in violation of the constitution and laws, Kristo said, requesting that the Constitutional Court comment on the issue.
Budimir was elected as FBiH President at Thursday's constitutive session of the House of Peoples, which was boycotted by the two main Croat parties, HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990. 
The parties complained that the election was held before three Croat-dominated cantons had nominated their delegates for the FBiH House of Peoples.

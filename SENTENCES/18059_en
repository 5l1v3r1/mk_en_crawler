LUXEMBOURG -- The EU foreign ministers welcomed on Monday (June 18th) the recent resumption of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia. 
In a statement issued after their meeting in Luxembourg, they said Serbia had shown determination to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The foreign ministers also reiterated their support for UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's proposal to resolve the Kosovo status issue, the basis for a new resolution at the Security Council. 
They called on the Council to resolve the Kosovo issue in a timely manner.
Also Monday, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic was in Luxembourg for bilateral meetings with the foreign ministers of France, Portugal, Slovenia and the Netherlands. 
He says Serbia is gaining support for a new round of UN-mediated negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina.
Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic, meanwhile, announced that the government has drafted a document with new ideas for resolving the status issue. 
He confirmed, however, that the text reiterates Belgrade's earlier suggestion that Kosovo be given broad autonomy within Serbian borders.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Officials announced on Tuesday (11 January) that Washington is interested in four or five installations in Bulgaria that could be used by the US military. 
Kicking off a two-day visit to Bulgaria, General James L. 
Jones, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe and head of the US European Command, said plans envision small "mobile bases" that could be used for operations by NATO's swift reaction forces. 
He visits facilities in Romania next.
In other news Tuesday, the ruling coalition partners NMS-II and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms voiced readiness to revise some texts of the amended law on political parties that were vetoed by President Georgi Parvanov late last month. 
The ruling coalition said they would respect Parvanov's objections to certain provisions.

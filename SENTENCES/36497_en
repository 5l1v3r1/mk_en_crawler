BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Ombudsman Marek Antoni Nowicki has warned that human rights protection in Kosovo, especially for minorities, falls short of the minimum international standards. 
In an interview with the Belgrade-based news agency FoNet on Sunday (8 August), Nowicki said Kosovo had "a long way to go" in terms of establishing European and democratic values. 
He added that Kosovo's final status must be resolved in order to ensure a normal life and good economic prospects for all communities.

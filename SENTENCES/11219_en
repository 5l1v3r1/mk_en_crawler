SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte says she expects Bosnian Serb indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic would be arrested by July. 
In a weekend interview with the Swiss publication L'Hedbo, del Ponte said she hopes to mark the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre "in the company of Karadzic and Mladic in The Hague". 
She also expressed satisfaction with Serbia-Montenegro for recently realising that co-operation with the tribunal is a pre-condition for EU integration.

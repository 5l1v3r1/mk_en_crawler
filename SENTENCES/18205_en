WASHINGTON, United States -- The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) is a terrorist organisation and "needs to be put out of business", retired US Air Force General Joseph Ralston said in an interview published on Thursday (March 15th).
The former supreme commander of NATO has been appointed Washington's special envoy to co-ordinate efforts against the Kurdish group.
He said that the United States has encouraged Iraqi and European authorities to curb the group's operations.
Ralston also expects an agreement soon in talks between US, Iraqi and Turkish officials on closing a refugee camp near the border with Turkey, which Ankara claims is used as a safe haven by the PKK.
He was responding to recent criticism from Turkish officials, who say the country is not receiving sufficient international support in the fight against terror.

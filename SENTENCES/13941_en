ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Bulgarian counterpart Sergey Stanishev in Ankara on Tuesday (17 January).
The leaders agreed to revise a 1998 bilateral agreement linking Turkish electricity imports from Bulgaria to participation of Turkish firms in Bulgarian infrastructure projects.
Turkey stopped buying power from Bulgaria in 2004 following the suspension of a joint project on water cascade construction in Bulgaria.

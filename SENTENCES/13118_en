BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police have intercepted a phone call from Ratko Mladic and may be closer to tracking him down, international media reported on Tuesday (27 December), quoting anonymous law enforcement sources.
The fugitive apparently used a mobile phone to get in touch with family members.
While confirming that authorities have new information about Mladic, Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said it is not enough to lead to his arrest.
There have also been reports that talks on the general's surrender are continuing, despite official denials.

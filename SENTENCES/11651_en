BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During their Monday (18 July) meeting in Brussels, the EU foreign ministers called on Albania's politicians to demonstrate maturity and observe all legal procedures related to the elections process.
The Foreign Ministers' Council welcomed the generally peaceful conduct of the 3 July parliamentary vote in Albania, but noted the number of shortcomings acknowledged in the international monitors' report.
Also Monday, Sali Berisha, the leader of the Democratic Party, which won the elections, called on President Alfred Moisiu to convene the first session of the new parliament.
By law, a session must be held within 20 days of the election.

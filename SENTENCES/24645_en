BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana announced on Friday (December 5th) that the EU-led mission in Kosovo, the EULEX, will begin operations on Tuesday, having reached its "initial operative capacity".
The mission's main task will be to bolster the supremacy of law, Solana said.
"Initially, there will be 1,300 international officials within EULEX.
We will have several months for the mission to reach its full operative level of 1,900 people, plus another 1,000 local officials who will work with us," Solana explained.
Meanwhile, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said on Friday that EULEX will operate under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, but will not be neutral regarding Kosovo's status.
Kosovo will not undergo a silent partition, Fried said to Radio Free Europe.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) says that while some progress has been made in meeting the conditions and objectives necessary to close the Office of the High Representative (OHR), it is not enough.
Wrapping up a two-day meeting Wednesday (June 25th), the PIC noted that the two conditions were the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and a positive assessment of the situation in BiH by the PIC.
The five objectives include finding an acceptable and sustainable resolution of the apportionment of property between state and other levels of government, the apportionment of state and defence property, fiscal sustainability, completion of the Brcko Final Award and enhancement of the rule of law.

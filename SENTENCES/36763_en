BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Quoting official sources, Serbian media reported Wednesday (21 July) that Belgrade is attempting to negotiate the surrender of Ratko Mladic, but that the former Bosnian Serb military leader has sent a message saying he refuses to give himself up. 
The Beta news agency and the daily Blic both said the government has been in indirect contact with the fugitive war crimes indictee through friends and family members. 
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic declined to comment on the reports, as did the federal defence minister, Prvoslav Davinic.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Wednesday (19 July) that he will attend a summit with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders in Vienna on Monday.
The meeting -- organised by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari -- is an attempt to reach a breakthrough in the talks on the province's future status.
Tadic said that he is satisfied that UN mediators had worked out "very small technical problems" that threatened Serbian participation.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament again failed to elect a new president when it met Sunday (May 6th) for a rerun of the April 27th first round vote.
The original round was annulled by the Constitutional Court due to lack of quorum.
On Sunday, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) was again unable to muster the required two-thirds of Parliament, due to an opposition boycott.
Following this latest setback, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul -- the sole nominee --said he is withdrawing his candidacy.
He has said, however, that he expects to be the AKP candidate if the constitution is changed to allow direct election of the president by voters, instead of by Parliament.
On Saturday, new rallies organised by secularist organisations against Gul's nomination took place in Manisa and Canakkale in western Turkey.
The protests again drew thousands of people.

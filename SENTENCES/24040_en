TIRANA, Albania -- The country marked the first anniversary Sunday (March 15th) of the ammunition depot explosions in Gerdec that killed 26 people and injured about 300. 
Supporters of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) laid flowers at the blast site to commemorate the Gerdec victims and marched to Tirana holding a big banner reading "Change". 
Later in the afternoon, in a speech to thousands of people gathered at Tirana's main square, SP leader Edi Rama blamed the government for the tragedy and urged it not to interfere with the judicial investigation aimed at establishing the cause of the blasts. 
The other opposition party, the Socialist Movement for Integration, blamed Prime Minister Sali Berisha directly and called for his resignation. 
Prosecutors have charged a total of 28 officials, including former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, over the blasts.

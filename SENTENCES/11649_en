In other news, the opposition VMRO-DPMNE said Thursday it has initiated a no-confidence motion against Mitreva in parliament.

Also Thursday, the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians and Party for Democratic Prosperity agreed to co-operate in the 13 March local elections. 
Party leaders said they decided to form the coalition since the vote will affect crucial issues of national interest for Macedonia as well as its ethnic Albanian minority.

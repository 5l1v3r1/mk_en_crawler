SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski called for dialogue with Greece over the countries' name dispute during his address on Friday (October 23rd) to mark the Day of Macedonian Revolutionary Struggle.
"This dispute was brought from the outside," Gruevksi said.
"However, I want to stress today that we are looking for a mutually acceptable solution."
Referring to previous Greek efforts to prevent Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU, Gruevski said such blockades have harmed both countries and brought them further away from finding a solution.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A new bill proposed by a junior Turkish Cypriot coalition partner has replaced a previous bill from the senior member of the ruling coalition, the Republican Turkish Party (CTP).
The bill, presented by the Democratic Party on Wednesday (14 July) in parliament's judicial commission, calls for deciding in September when to hold the elections.
CTP's bill had called for early elections in September.
Analysts predict early elections would most likely be called along with the presidential vote next April.

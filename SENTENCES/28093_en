BELGRADE, Serbia -- An appeals court in Belgrade shaved the war crimes sentence of former Yugoslav army officer Damir Sireta from 20 to 15 years in prison Monday (September 20th). 
In June 2009, Sireta was convicted of participating in the 1991 executions of 200 Croatian prisoners of war. 
He belonged to an execution squad that killed prisoners in Ovcara, eastern Croatia.

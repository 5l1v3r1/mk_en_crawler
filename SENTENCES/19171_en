WASHINGTON, United States -- A Pentagon probe has confirmed that the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) is using US weapons meant for the Iraqi army, the New York Times reported on Thursday (August 30th). 
For the time being, however, there is no evidence of resale on the part of Iraqi security forces or Kurdish officials. 
Nor is it known exactly how many weapons ended up with PKK fighters. 
The probe is continuing.

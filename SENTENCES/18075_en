BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leader of G17 Plus, Mladjan Dinkic, said on Sunday (March 18th) that unless the parties in the democratic bloc strike an agreement on a new coalition government within a week or two, the talks would inevitably fail.
He also called on all parties to prepare for a compromise.
Representatives of G17 Plus, the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia alliance plan to meet again on Tuesday.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission announced on Tuesday (22 July) that it would challenge a Greek law passed earlier this month that bans slot machines in all establishments except the country's seven casinos.
The Commission argued that the legislation is unfair because it not only prohibits games that might give rise to social concerns, but also ones that pose no risk to public order or to consumers.
Brussels also accused Athens of failing to notify the EU in advance of its intentions.
The Commission said adoption of the new law would restrict imports of gambling products and violate the EU treaty on the free movement of goods.

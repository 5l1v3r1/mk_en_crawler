NEW YORK, United States -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou plans to present a draft resolution to the 58th UN General Assembly on Friday (26 September) that would promote sports as means for uniting the world.
The UN is expected to approve the draft and table it to all UN member-states for immediate ratification in early November, according to a report Wednesday by the ANA news agency.
Athens is hosting the 2004 Summer Olympics.
Also Wednesday, Greek authorities started a two-day exercise on security contingencies that might occur during the Games.
Several foreign and Greek experts are participating in the drill.

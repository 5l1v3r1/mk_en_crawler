OHRID, Macedonia -- Macedonian Defence Minister Jovan Manasijevski and his counterparts from Albania and Bulgaria -- Pandeli Majko and Nikolai Svinarov, respectively -- signed an agreement Tuesday (17 May) that further strengthens co-operation between the three countries' defence sectors. 
The meeting was also attended by the chiefs of the three countries' armed forces. 
Majko said the document was an important step towards improving stability and security in the Balkans. 
Svinarov said the region would become much safer when Albania, Croatia and Macedonia join NATO and two other countries -- Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina -- enter the Partnership for Peace programme.

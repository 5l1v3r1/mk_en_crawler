PLOCE, Croatia -- During a visit to the port of Ploce on Saturday (9 August), Prime Minister Ivica Racan said he would seek co-operation with neighbouring countries and the EU to set up an exclusive economic zone in the Adriatic, in a bid to introduce clear fishing regulations. 
A week earlier, the Slovenian Foreign Ministry expressed concerns such an initiative could cause ecological damage to the sea. 
Political parties from Slovenia and Serbia-Montenegro later held a meeting in Belgrade to discuss the issue. 
The Croatian press also reported possible demands for division of the Adriatic Sea among successors of the former Yugoslavia.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two separate developments Wednesday (26 July) suggest further delays in implementing police and public broadcasting reforms, both of which are key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The BiH Police Reform Directorate decided on Wednesday to extend the deadline for drafting a proposal on the future structure of the police system from 30 September to 30 November.
Panel chairman Vinko Dumancic blamed the continuing boycott by Republika Srpska representatives, who oppose the full abolition of entity responsibilities in the police sector.
Separately, public broadcasting reform appeared delayed by a ruling from the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Constitutional Court.
Approached by the Croat caucus of the FBiH upper house -- the court agreed that some texts in the new bill on the FBiH public broadcasting service threaten the national interests of Croats in the entity.
The third round of technical talks on the SAA opened on Thursday.
In other news Wednesday, the BiH Central Election Commission completed the verification of candidates' lists for the 1 October general elections.
A total of 7,245 nominees were approved.

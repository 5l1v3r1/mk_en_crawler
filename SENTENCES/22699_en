TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli said on Sunday (November 9th) that the recent European Commission's (EC) progress report on Albania was the most positive in recent years.
She conceded, however, much work must be done to meet European standards.
Topalli pledged the ruling coalition would conduct free and fair elections in 2009, a point stressed by the EC report last week.
On Saturday, the government reportedly asked the OSCE to send more observers than usual for next year's parliamentary elections, which observers consider vital to the country's EU aspirations.

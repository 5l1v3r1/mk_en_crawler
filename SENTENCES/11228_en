ATHENS, Greece -- The government reportedly wants the reinstallation of the security system used during the 2004 Athens Olympics, and has asked the country's Data Protection Authority to endorse the return of the security operations centre and some 1,000 closed circuit TV cameras used during the Games.
According to cabinet sources cited in Wednesday's (27 July) Kathimerini, the decision followed the latest terror attacks in London and Egypt.
The privacy watchdog agency is expected to rule on the request next week.

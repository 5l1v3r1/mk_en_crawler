TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha reiterated on Sunday (March 8th) that Albania planned to apply for EU candidate status by June. 
In an interview with AFP, Berisha said the Czech Republic, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has given the green light to Albania. 
He warned a possible delay in the application process would affect motivation among the public, about 96% of whom support EU entry. 
Last week, the European Commission said free and fair parliamentary elections in late June were key to moving forward with Albania's bid.

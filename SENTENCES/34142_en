SKOPJE, Macedonia -- What started out as a protest by 300 laid-off workers from the power company ESM ended up as a clash with police Wednesday (16 July) outside parliament.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski criticised the violence and attempts by protestors to enter the building.
He said the government would proceed with reforms.

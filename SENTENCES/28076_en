ANKARA, Turkey -- Members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) met on Wednesday (October 20th), but failed to find common ground regarding the potential lifting of the headscarf ban at universities, as the AKP wants.
The party proposes establishment of a joint working group on the issue, with the participation of opposition parties.
But the CHP parliamentary group leader, Kemal Anadol, stressed that his party would not nominate members unless other, non-related conditions were met, including restructuring the Higher Board of Education, addressing parliamentary immunity, and issues related to lowering the election threshold.
Also Wednesday, the Supreme Court said that allowing headscarves in universities contradicts the principle of secularism, noting that neither domestic laws nor international practice consider wearing headscarves in universities as a freedom of religion right.

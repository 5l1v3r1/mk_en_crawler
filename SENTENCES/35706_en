BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following a ban over financing of the nationalist Serb Democratic Party (SDS) from the budgets of BiH, Republika Srpska (RS) and RS municipalities, High Representative Paddy Ashdown set a deadline Sunday (4 April) for SDS leader Dragan Kalinic to submit a report on the party's financial activities by 19 April.
Ashdown imposed the ban and warned of further sanctions, citing SDS's failure to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Ashdown visits Banja Luka on Monday to meet with Kalinic and RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic.

ATHENS, Greece -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed praise for the way Greece, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has handled the Iraq issue.
On Friday (25 April), Powell said Athens, and especially Foreign Minister George Papandreou, handled the rift among EU countries "with great skill".
He said he believes a complete rupture within the EU was averted.
On a separate note, he voiced disappointment that a UN proposal for resolving the Cyprus issue had failed.

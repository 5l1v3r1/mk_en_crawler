TEHRAN, Iran -- The government notified Turkey on Saturday (January 12th) that it would be unable to resume deliveries of natural gas due to domestic issues. 
Tehran stopped exporting gas to its neighbour more than a week ago because of shortages at home and problems with imports from Turkmenistan. 
A spokesman for the Iranian national gas company told reporters that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered all available resources be directed to meet local demand, especially in light of the cold weather. 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier that he had received assurances that deliveries would resume this week.

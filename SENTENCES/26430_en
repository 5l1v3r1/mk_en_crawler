BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic reiterated on Sunday (March 14th) that Serbia will take part in all regional meetings at which Kosovo participates, as long as it in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Speaking to journalists after talks with Hungarian counterpart Laszlo Solyom in Novi Sad, Tadic said that would apply to an upcoming EU-Balkan forum in Slovenia.
He stressed that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence, either implicitly or explicitly.
His office said on Sunday that Serbia's participation in the forum is still unclear because of Kosovo's representation.
As for relations between Hungary and Serbia, both Tadic and Solyom said all was well.
Solyom said that the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina is contributing to Serbia's EU integration efforts and that Budapest will do all it can to help Serbia join the bloc.

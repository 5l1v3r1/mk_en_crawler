ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is clearing the way for its EU accession bid by preparing a proposal to parliament that would make Turkey a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol.
After a cabinet meeting Monday (June 2nd), government spokesman Cemil Cicek told reporters that if Turkey does not ratify the protocol, it will not be able to negotiate effectively in the post-Kyoto era.
The protocol -- aimed at curbing harmful emissions -- expires in 2012 and falls under EU environmental legislation.
After the United States, Turkey is the biggest holdout on Kyoto, a situation that subjected it to intense international pressure.
Turkey previously rejected signing the protocol, saying it needed to complete its industrial development first.

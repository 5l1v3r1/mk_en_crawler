ZAGREB, Croatia -- The former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Montenegro agreed on Wednesday (March 12th) to send their border dispute to the International Court in The Hague for a ruling. 
As of now, there is only a temporary agreement on it. 
"The governments of the two countries will establish a joint commission that will take up the preparation of the respective document to settle the issue," Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader told journalists after talks in Zagreb with his Montenegrin counterpart, Milo Djukanovic. 
At issue is the land and sea border at the Prevlaka peninsula.

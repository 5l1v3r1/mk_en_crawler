SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Participation in international peacekeeping missions will be the priority in Macedonia's eighth NATO Membership Action Plan, Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski said on Tuesday (12 September). 
The new government hopes to prove to NATO that after 11 years in the Partnership for Peace programme, Macedonia is prepared to join the Alliance, he said.
In other news Tuesday, the State Anti-Corruption Commission ruled there was no nepotism involved in two recent appointments. 
A cousin of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has been tapped as the head of the Security and Counterintelligence Service, while the husband of Deputy Prime Minister Gabriela Konevska-Trajkovska is the new head of the Public Revenues Agency.
Also Tuesday, Gruevski was in Brussels, where he met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn. 
The latter assured Gruevski that the European Commission is satisfied with the progress achieved by Macedonia so far and welcomes the commitment of the new government to continue EU membership-related reforms. 
Later in the day, Gruevski met with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who told him that NATO would send an encouraging message to Macedonia during its November summit in Riga.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic stressed Serbia's commitment to fighting organised crime both domestically and regionally Monday (September 28th), adding that Belgrade is depending on EU support in the matter. 
Opening a regional ministerial conference on organised crime in the Western Balkans, Justice Minister Snezana Malovic and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic stressed the need for a regional approach to deal with the problem. 
European Commission Vice President for Justice, Freedom and Security issues Jacques Barrot, who attended the forum, warned that organised crime could threaten the stability of the region and its EU integration.
While in Belgrade, Barrot met with several officials and said that Serbia has made progress towards a visa-free regime with the bloc, but added that a technical European Commission (EC) mission will visit Belgrade in the first half of October for the final say on the issue. 
If the assessment is positive, the EC will abolish visa requirements for Serbian citizens starting in January.
In other news, a French citizen who was attacked by Serbian hooligans on September 17th died on Tuesday, doctors said. 
Brice Taton, 28, was in a critical condition after chest surgery following the assault, which took place after France's football team Toulouse beat Partizan Belgrade. 
Police have arrested 11 people in connection with the attack.

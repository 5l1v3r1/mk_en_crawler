TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE Ambassador to Albania, Pavel Vacek, expressed optimism about implementation of the election law reform, in an interview with the local press.
Vacek said he believes the agreement reached between the two major powers -- the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party -- about amendments to the Electoral Code and drawing a new election map would be fully observed.
He said he expects the expert group formed by parliament to work on election zone boundaries would complete a draft report by 5 February, as scheduled.
Albania holds parliamentary elections later this year.

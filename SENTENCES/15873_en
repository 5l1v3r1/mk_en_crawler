SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- BiH's entry to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) could be jeopardised if the country fails to resolve problems related to the free trade contracts with Croatia and Serbia, Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe Erhard Busek said at his meeting with Principal Deputy High Representative Larry Butler and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic in Sarajevo on Wednesday (19 July).
CEFTA will organise a meeting between Terzic and his Croatian and Serbian counterparts Ivo Sanader and Voislav Koshtunica on 1 August in Salzburg to discuss the issue.

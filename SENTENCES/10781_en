BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic told a meeting of his Serbian Renewal Movement on Sunday (7 November) that the Serbian government's refusal to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal is a "scandal".
He said his party would raise the issue with its partners in the ruling coalition.
"The protection of four or five of the commanders who were most loyal to Slobodan Milosevic is [being] placed above the destiny of the people and the state," Draskovic said.
On Friday, Serbian President Boris Tadic called for the arrest of all those indicted by The Hague tribunal, stressing it is the only solution to the ongoing situation.

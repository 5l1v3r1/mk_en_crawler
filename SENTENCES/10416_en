ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Friday (19 November), Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) opened a new border crossing at Salvonski Samac on the Croatian side and Bosanski Samac/Srpski Samac on the BiH side.
The construction of the bridge connecting the two sides cost 1.8m euros and was in line with a bilateral agreement on increased border railway traffic.
Three more border crossings will be built as well.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament gave preliminary approval Monday (May 7th) to a constitutional amendment that would allow voters to elect the next president directly.The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) sponsored the move after Parliament last week failed to elect its candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
To take effect, the change must be approved by two thirds of parliament's 550 members during a second round of voting, then okayed by incumbent President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
The AKP says a presidential election could be held alongside the early general election in July.
Meanwhile, in remarks to the European Parliament' Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the political situation in Turkey is very sensitive.
"Europe needs to show patience and prudence with Turkey.
Turkey is undergoing a difficult but historic process of transformation," he said.

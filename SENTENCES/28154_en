ANKARA, Turkey -- As promised, the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) submitted an application Friday (May 14th), asking the Constitutional Court to annul the package of constitutional amendments recently approved by parliament.
The CHP gathered the minimum of 110 lawmakers' signatures required for the challenge.
Party leaders argue that the reforms, drafted by the ruling Justice and Development Party, violate the spirit of the constitution and that procedural violations occurred during the legislative process.
If the Constitutional Court upholds the amendments, they will be subject to a referendum on September 12th.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- During a visit to Cyprus on Wednesday (25 January), British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called for "friendship" between the island's divided ethnic communities, adding that London is willing to serve as a mediator. 
According to regional press reports, Straw got a frosty reception in Nicosia, where officials were angry over his decision to visit the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern part of the island. 
Straw ended up meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou, after President Tassos Papadopoulos refused to talk with him.
While in Nicosia, Straw urged the Greek Cypriots to consider Turkey's new plan to end the north's economic isolation. 
Under the proposal, Ankara would open its ports and waters to Greek Cypriot aircraft and ships, while the Turkish Cypriot republic would be opened for international business. 
Straw later met with Turkish Cypriot President Mehmet Ali Talat before travelling on to Turkey and Greece for further discussions.

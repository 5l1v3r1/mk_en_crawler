TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a pair of cabinet personnel changes at a session Thursday (September 16th) that was boycotted by the opposition. 
Both changes involve members of the junior coalition partner Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI). 
Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta moves from foreign minister to minister of economy, telecommunication and energy. 
He had argued he wanted to spend less time aboard in order to focus on party developments. 
Edmond Haxhinasto replaces Meta as foreign minister. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha proposed the changes earlier this week. 
Due to the opposition boycott, they were approved by 72 of the 140 lawmakers.

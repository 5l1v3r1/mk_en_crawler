ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government on Friday (October 9th) supported changes to the law on rights of war veterans and forwarded the amendments for immediate parliamentary approval. 
The amendments provide that there will be no more war veterans in the future, because of the long 13-year period that has passed since the independence war. 
Furthermore, there will be a significant tightening in the requirements for granting pensions to persons, who have already applied to be treated as war veterans.
According to Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, the amendments were supported by both ruling coalition partners and the association of war veterans. 
One of the main novelties is the requirement for participation in the independence war for at least 100 days, as opposed to one year at present, for the receipt of a minimum pension, which is equal to 45% of the average wage.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops and Republika Srpska (RS) police raided the homes of Stojan Zupljanin's relatives on Friday (April 13th) and Saturday. 
He is on the UN war crimes tribunal's "most-wanted" list, along with Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. 
The RS Interior Ministry said one of the houses searched belongs to Slobodan Zupljanin, the chairman of the BiH Foreign Trade Chamber. 
His property has been subjected to several similar operations in the past. 
This time, officials say a significant amount of documentation was seized for analysis. 
Stojan Zupljanin has been on the run since his indictment in 1999.

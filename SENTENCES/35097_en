SKOPJE, Macedonia -- By a narrow margin, parliament adopted the law on the status of Skopje Wednesday (25 February). 
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE and Liberal Party boycotted the vote, while ruling coalition partners SDSM and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) voiced serious concerns about some stipulations. 
Points of contention include the status of Aracinovo -- the former stronghold of ethnic Albanian rebels -- and the DUI's demand for use of Albanian as a second official language throughout the entire Skopje area. 
The law stipulates division of the city into nine municipalities. 
Debate will continue during the second reading.

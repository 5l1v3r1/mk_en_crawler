WASHINGTON, United States -- Several key drug trafficking routes pass through the Balkans, the US State Department said in its annual international narcotics control strategy reports, published on Friday (February 29th). 
A major corridor for drugs from Southwest Asia to Europe lies through Turkey, while Albania continues to be a transit point for drugs from Central Asia to Western Europe, the report said. 
Newly-independent Kosovo is mentioned as a key point for the transfer of heroin from Turkey and Afghanistan to Western Europe. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is described as a main trafficking point due to its strategic location, weak state institutions, insufficient anti-trafficking personnel and inadequate co-ordination among agencies.
Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia are also cited as avenues for trafficking drugs to various parts of Europe. 
In addition, drugs are being produced in several countries -- including Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo and Romania.

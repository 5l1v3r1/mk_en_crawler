ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted Sunday (26 September) to adopt a new penal code that brings the country's laws closer to EU standards. 
The European Commission has signalled this would be the last hurdle before the start of accession talks with Ankara. 
A controversial provision that would have criminalised adultery was excluded from the draft. 
The Turkish opposition backed the new penal code but objected to several of its provisions, including one that delays sanctions against polluters.
In other news Sunday, Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg was quoted as saying it would be an "injustice" if the EU denied membership to Turkey. 
He argued that as a NATO member, Ankara has worked hard for decades to strengthen Europe's security.

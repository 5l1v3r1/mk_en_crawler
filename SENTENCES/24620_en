PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Several hundred Kosovo Serbs blocked access to a police station in the northern town of Leposavic on Thursday (March 5th), preventing Kosovo police chief Sheremet Ahmeti and EULEX Police Director Reiner Kuehn from entering the building. 
Earlier, Ahmeti and Kuehn visited the Leposavic crossing at the border with Serbia, but when they tried to enter the police station, the demonstrators thwarted them. 
Ahmeti and Kuehn decided to cancel the visit and return to Pristina.
On Wednesday, EULEX prosecutors and judges held the first court session in the northern town of Mitrovica since clashes a year ago between local Serbs and UN police. 
The trial involves two men accused of committing a robbery in the Leposavic region in October 2007.
In other news, a visiting Swedish delegation told government officials that Sweden planned to downsize the number of its troops in KFOR later this year. 
The move will coincide with an increase in civilian staff. 
On Wednesday, the British Embassy in Pristina announced that the United Kingdom would withdraw a large number of its troops from Kosovo by September, given the improved security situation.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- At a secret meeting Sunday (March 4th), the leaders of the three parties of Macedonian ruling coalition -- VMRO-DPMNE, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) and the New Social Democratic Party (NSDP) -- managed to overcome a growing dispute. 
Relations between DPA and NSDP had grown strained after NSDP leader Tito Petkovski said that largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), should be invited to join the cabinet. 
Petkovski stressed that if DUI's entry into the ruling coalition is the price of normalised political dialogue, the tripartite coalition should pay it.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Civilian Office (ICO) will continue to insist on consulting all parties, including Belgrade, regarding implementation of a strategy to extend Prstina's authority into Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.
"The ICO calls on everyone to have a constructive role in this process, which aims at improving living conditions for citizens in the north.
This call also includes representatives from Belgrade," ICO spokesman Andy McGuffie said on Sunday (February 14th).
The strategy is aimed at ending Belgrade-backed parallel structures in the north.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- It is time for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to move on from the "Dayton era" to the "Brussels era", EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (January 22nd) after a meeting with BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic in Brussels.
BiH should boost its administrative capacity to successfully implement its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, Rehn said.
He added that the country should do what it must to implement reforms that will strengthen the fight against corruption and organised crime.
According to Rehn, 2009 could become a very important year for the European integration of the Western Balkans, including BiH.
Radmanovic said BiH's leadership has made implementing EU-related reforms one of its main goals.
He promised decisive measures to demonstrate that BiH is not lagging behind the rest of the Western Balkan countries in its integration process.
In other news Thursday, Rehn discussed Bulgaria, saying its current level of corruption requires that the EU continue monitoring how that country spends EU funds.
Rehn says the major problem continues to be that all programme managers are political appointees, making independent and impartial management of EU-funded programmes virtually impossible.

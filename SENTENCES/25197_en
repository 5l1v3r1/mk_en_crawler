BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday (January 28th) urged Greece to meet obligations to its EU partners and bring its double-digit budget deficit within the bloc's 3% of GDP ceiling.
While saying that Greece must meet its obligations to the rest of the bloc, Barroso added that the EU should support the country as it tries to solve the problem.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou denied media speculation that the country has asked for EU support.
He stressed that Athens is determined solve its debt problem on its own.

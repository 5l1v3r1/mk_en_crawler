ANKARA, Turkey -- An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity said on Sunday (August 15th) that Turkey snubbed Israeli Ambassador Gabi Levi recently by not inviting him to a diplomatic dinner. 
Lawmaker Omer Celik of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party explained the decision was not personal; rather, it was aimed at displaying "criticism" of the Israeli government's policy. 
The foreign ministry in Jerusalem reacted by saying that "once again it appears that [Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip] Erdogan is initiating an escalation and searching for it." Bilateral ties have been strained since the May 31st Israeli raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza left nine people dead.

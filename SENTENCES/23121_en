ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis vowed on Thursday (October 2nd) to continue implementing his government's reform agenda, despite the wave of union protests against his privatisation plans for state air carrier Olympic Air.
"Greece has only one path it can take, the path that leads ahead.
This government was elected to change things, and this is what it will do," Karamanlis said after a cabinet meeting.
Hundreds of state companies' employees marched in Athens to demand fresh elections and to protest the privatisation of Olympic Air and other state-owned firms.
Workers from the transport sector say they plan a 24-hour strike next week.

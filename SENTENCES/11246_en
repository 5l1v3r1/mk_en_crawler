PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Friday (24 December) that Montenegro was ready to hold the referendum on the state union with Serbia in 2005 and would ask the EU to shorten the existing three-year waiting period.
The government wants to schedule the referendum before the elections for the state union's parliament in early 2005.

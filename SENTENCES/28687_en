NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Council of Europe wants the Albanian opposition to take its case for election transparency to court, rather than stage "immature" boycotts or hunger strikes that paralyze reforms.
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) President Mevlut Cavusoglu on Saturday (June 12th) reminded the opposition Socialist Party (SP) that it was advised by PACE to do so in February.
"We asked the opposition to address the Constitutional Court and ask for an opinion from the Venice Commission," said Cavusoglu, adding that the SP did neither.
His comments followed a meeting with Albanian Parliament Speaker Jozafina Topalli in Cyprus.
She reiterated the government's stance that the contested general elections, held almost a year ago, were approved by international institutions as meeting OSCE standards.
Reacting to Cavusoglu's statement, SP lawmaker Besnik Baraj said the opposition is doing "all it can to solve the crisis".

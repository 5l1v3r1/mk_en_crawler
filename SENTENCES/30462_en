TIRANA, Albania -- Representatives of the OSCE and EU in Tirana said on Thursday (February 17th) that the upcoming May 8th local elections will be held in better conditions than previous elections. 
EU Ambassador Ettore Sequi said the updated digital civil registry means that Albania has one less problem to worry about. 
Speaking at a conference on the national civil registration system, Sequi said that Albanians now have electronic ID cards and biometric passports. 
OSCE Ambassador Eugen Wollfarth agreed that modernising the address system means voter lists are far more precise.

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- A Romanian fraudster detained in Indonesia will be extradited to Bucharest next month, Indonesian police spokesperson Iskandar Hasan said on Thursday (November 25th). 
Nicolae Popa fled Romania in 2006 after being sentenced to 15 years in prison for organising a pyramid scheme. 
He was detained in Jakarta last December. 
The final decision is now up to a local court since the two countries have no extradition agreement. 
Popa's repatriation has already been approved by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the justice ministry.

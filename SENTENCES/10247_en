SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government has shown no willingness to co-operate in the apprehension and transfer of indicted war criminals to the UN war crimes tribunal, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said in a media interview over the weekend. 
Although RS leaders have made statements pledging co-operation, concrete results have yet to follow, McElhaney added.
On Friday (26 November), the RS government decided to ask the BiH Foreign Ministry to seek a trilateral agreement with Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro on collaboration in ICTY-related activities. 
RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic, who met with ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in The Hague on Friday, promised that concrete steps would be taken to arrest fugitives.

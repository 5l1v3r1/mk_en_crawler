BELGRADE, Serbia -- Officials in Kosovo welcomed the Kosovo status proposal presented by UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari on Friday (2 February).
Serbian officials, however, rejected the blueprint and announced a special parliament debate session on Belgrade's future course of action.
While it did not specifically mention independence, the proposal would make it possible for Kosovo to have its own flag, national anthem, army and constitution.
Kosovo would also be able to seek international recognition.
According to the plan, a NATO-led peacekeeping force will remain in the province and an international representative will be appointed to monitor the government's actions.
Speaking on Saturday, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said that with the plan the province was moving closer to independence.
He noted that the plan ensures Kosovo's territorial integrity and that the whole territory would be governed by institutions in Pristina.
In Belgrade, President Boris Tadic vowed not to recognize an independent Kosovo.
Outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica called the blueprint "illegitimate" and the leader of the extreme nationalist Radical Party Tomislav Nikolic vowed that Kosovo independence would be short-lived.

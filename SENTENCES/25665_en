PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The trial of Vetevendosje (Self Determination) movement leader Albin Kurti was adjourned again Tuesday (February 23rd) when the defendant failed to appear in court, for the second time this week.
Kurti is accused of participating in a crowd committing a criminal offence and taking part in a crowd obstructing officials from performing their duties during a demonstration three years ago.
He is the only person being held responsible for a demonstration February 10th 2007 during which two protestors died and more than 80 people were wounded.
Kurti first boycotted the start of his trial on February 15th to protest international missions that don't recognise Kosovo's independence, prompting a week-long adjournment.
On Tuesday, that was extended until March 2nd.
Separately Tuesday, local media reported that two activists of the movement were arrested.
Self-Determination describes the arrests as politically motivated.

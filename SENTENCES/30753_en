SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the opposition SDSM party, accepted an invitation on Friday (March 11th) to meet with Prime Minister and ruling VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski about a date for holding early parliamentary elections.
About ten days ago, Gruevski suggested holding them in late April.
Crvenkovski set two conditions, including legislative changes, and insists the elections should be held in late June or early July.

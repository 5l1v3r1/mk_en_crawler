PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police on Friday (March 5th) detained another person as part of an investigation into politically motivated murders in Kosovo.
Shpresim Uka was interrogated at Pristina's District Court.
Though released, he will have to report to authorities weekly.
Uka is said to be a former member of the Kosovo Information Service, an intelligence agency with suspected links to the ruling Democratic Party.
He is suspected of murder, attempted murder, and participation in organised crime.
EULEX launched its investigation after allegations by former agent Nazim Bllaca -- already in custody -- that Uka participated in several murders and blackmails against "enemies of the state".
Bllaca made public statements in November 2009 detailing events following the 1999 conflict in Kosovo.
Bllaca has insisted that several senior state, party, and police officials were involved.

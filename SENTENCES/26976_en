SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Members of the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) arrested on Wednesday (November 4th) a former Bosnian Muslim commander, suspected of war crimes against civilians committed during the country's 1992-1995 conflict.
Nihad Bojadzic, deputy commander of a Muslim-led army special unit called Zulfikar, was detained in Sarajevo.
He is suspected of killing 22 Croats -- 19 civilians and three soldiers -- in April 1993, during an attack on the village of Trusina.
Four other people, including two children, were injured.
In September, four Bosnian Muslims were arrested on the same charges.
Also Wednesday, an IMF team arrived in Sarajevo for a first review of the implementation of a 1.2 billion-euro stand-by arrangement.
BiH has drawn 202m euros under the first tranche of the loan and hopes to get another 100m euros by the end of the year.

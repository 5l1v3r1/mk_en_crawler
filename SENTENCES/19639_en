SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition ultranationalist party Attack announced on Tuesday (January 22nd) it is drafting a vote of no confidence against Parliament Speaker Georgi Pirinski of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.
Attack cites Pirinski's decision to limit the access of journalists to some parts of parliament, forcing them to congregate around opposition parties and the Movement for Rights and Freedom.
Pirinski is also accused of deliberately delaying the opposition's draft laws, and blocking their questions to ministers.
Attack also revealed a document it says shows that Pirinski, who was born in New York, does not have Bulgarian citizenship.
By law, only a citizen can be speaker.
Pirinski says the allegations are groundless.

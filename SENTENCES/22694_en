SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski said on Sunday (April 6th) he wants to clarify Skopje's strategy in resolving the name dispute with Athens after it cost the country an invitation to NATO membership last week. 
The government is launching urgent discussions this week to find a suitable solution as soon as possible, Crvenkovski said. 
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski insists Macedonia has not given up its NATO bid.
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was quoted in Sunday's edition of the newspaper Kathimerini as saying that Athens is ready to resume talks on the issue, noting that unless it is settled, Athens is ready to block Skopje's EU bid as well. 
Greece says use of the name Macedonia amounts to a territorial claim on a province by that name in northern Greece.

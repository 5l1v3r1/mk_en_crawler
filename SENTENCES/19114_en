BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat voiced hope that the EU would fulfill its pledges and end the trade and economic isolation of Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus by June. 
Talat told the AP on Wednesday (February 28th) that he expects the German presidency of the EU to ensure a breakthrough before its mandate expires in June. 
His comment followed talks with top EU and Belgian officials in Brussels earlier this week.

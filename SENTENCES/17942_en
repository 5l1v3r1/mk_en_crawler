BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade hosted a conference of the Party of European Socialists (PES) on Wednesday (May 16th), bringing together representatives of Socialist and Social Democratic parties from EU countries and the Western Balkan states.
During the forum, participants sealed a document titled "Pact for Social Democracy, EU Integration and Regional Co-operation".
Addressing the attendants, PES President Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said the place of Serbia and other former Yugoslav republics, as well as Albania, was closer to the EU.
"I am confident that nationalistic insularity will be defeated as comprehensively by social democratic co-operation in the Balkans as it has been in Western Europe," he said.

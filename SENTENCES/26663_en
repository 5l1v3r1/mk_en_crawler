PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The human rights group Amnesty International is demanding justice in the case of two members of the Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement who were killed three years ago.
In a public letter, the group addressed legal institutions and UNMIK on the anniversary of the deaths of Mon Balaj and Arben Xheladini.
UNMIK forces opened fire on a crowd during a violent protest in Pristina on February 10th 2007.
The rubber bullets fired were well past their expiration date and became lethal.
Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti goes on trial next week for organising the demonstration.
The Self-Determination group said Kurti will boycott the beginning of the trial to protest international missions that don't recognise Kosovo's independence.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- New federal Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic says he is unaware of top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic's whereabouts. 
In the first interviews given since his appointment was approved late last week, Stankovic said he has had no contacts with Mladic -- reportedly a former close friend -- since 1999. 
Stankovic also denied promising UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte at a recent meeting that Mladic would be transferred to The Hague tribunal within two months.

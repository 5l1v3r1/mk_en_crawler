ATHENS, Greece -- The government issued a statement Tuesday (20 January) commending Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul's response to Greece's proposed gradual reduction in defence spending. 
Greek government spokesman Christos Protopappas said Turkey's response provided a positive basis for a dialogue about the proposal, put forth last week by Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou. 
Protopappas described the proposal as a sign of Greece's desire for good neighbourly relations with Turkey.

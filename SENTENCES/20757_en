LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) poses a more serious threat to stability in the Balkans than Kosovo, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa told journalists Monday (January 7th).
Slovenia currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
"For Kosovo it's clear what will happen, it's more a question of how to do it," he explained in an apparent reference to the Serbian province's future independence.
"For Bosnia, the question is:
are the Dayton Agreements working?
First we have to see if the Dayton Agreement works," Jansa said.
He complained that BiH is still not a viable state because it cannot govern itself and needs foreign administrators.
Leaders of the main BiH parties have agreed to resume constitutional reform negotiations this year, but only after long-awaited police reform occurs.

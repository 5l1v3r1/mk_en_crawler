ZURICH, Switzerland -- The army has organised a camp for children with special needs from the former Yugoslav republics and Albania.
Some 400 Swiss soldiers, many of them volunteers, have helped kids from Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to experience what one organiser described as "peaceful coexistence in action".
All group activities were held with the help of translators.
The children also received medical treatment for their problems.

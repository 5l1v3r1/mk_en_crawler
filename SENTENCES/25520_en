BUCHAREST, Romania -- Collaboration between Romanian authorities and international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank will continue, President Traian Basescu said on Wednesday (March 24th), adding this does not necessarily imply a new financing programme after the current one expires in 2011.
Addressing the opening of a session of the American Chamber of Commerce in Romania, Basescu said that as a member of both the Bank and the IMF, Romania can always turn to them for technical assistance.

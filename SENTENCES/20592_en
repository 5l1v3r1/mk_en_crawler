SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Local media reported on Wednesday (January 9th) that Macedonia will introduce visa restrictions for citizens of more than 140 countries, effective February 1st.
The measure is part of the country's obligations as an EU aspirant.
No visa regime will be introduced for the countries of the former Yugoslavia because some of them are already EU candidates, while others have visa facilitation agreements with the union.
As of February 1st, visas for Albanian citizens entering Macedonia will be issued at the country's embassy in Tirana instead of at the border crossing.
Albania criticised the change, calling it a setback reminiscent of the old regime.
People living in Kosovo will not need visas to enter Macedonia as long as they hold passports issued by UNMIK.
However, if Kosovo becomes independent and starts issuing its own passports, a new visa regime will be introduced for them, as well.

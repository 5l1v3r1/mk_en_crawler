SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serb presidency member Nebojsa Radmanovic said on Saturday (February 9th) that BiH will not recognise Kosovo's independence in case of unilateral declaration.
Noting that all decisions by the tripartite presidency require consensus, he said that he, as the Serb representative, will vote against recognising Kosovo's independence.
He is concerned about its potential "domino effect all over Europe".
Separately Saturday, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said he does not expect Kosovo's independence to have any impact on BiH.

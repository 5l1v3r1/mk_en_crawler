STRASBOURG, France -- Members of the European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee held a closed door debate Thursday (March 10th) on allegations of human organ trafficking in Kosovo included in a report by Council of Europe rapporteur Dick Marty. 
Media in Belgrade cited sources who said discussions were heated and ended with the decision that the EP must end its long silence on the issue and appoint its own rapporteur on organised crime in Kosovo.

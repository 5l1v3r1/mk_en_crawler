BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said on Thursday (June 28th) there is no enmity between his country and Serbia despite their disagreements over the future status of Kosovo.
Commenting on a statement by Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who said a new battle for Kosovo is being waged between Serbia and the United States, Polt said there are only differences over some issues, though there are thousands of issues on which the two countries agree.
Separately, during an interview with the BBC's Albanian language service, US Deputy Undersecretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo reiterated her government's position that Kosovo's independence is inevitable.

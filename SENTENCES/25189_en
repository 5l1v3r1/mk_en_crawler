TIRANA, Albania -- Two Albanians were arrested on Wednesday (January 27th) at Mother Teresa airport while allegedly trying to help illegal immigrants reach Western Europe. 
The pair is believed to have charged two Turkish immigrants 6,500 euros each to fly them from Albania through Kosovo to Austria. 
Investigators are trying to determine if the two are part of a larger human trafficking network.

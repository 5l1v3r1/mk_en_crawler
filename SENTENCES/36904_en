SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic reiterated on Sunday (4 July) his belief that no government crisis would emerge in the country following the latest developments in Republika Srpska (RS).
Terzic, deputy chairman of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA), also said the SDA was not affected by the sanctions imposed by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
BiH Foreign Minister and Party for Democratic Progress leader Mladen Ivanic had called for early elections in RS and the replacement of SDA's three ministers in the RS government in response to Ashdown's sacking of 60 RS officials.
Terzic dismissed Ivanic's statement as "emotional".

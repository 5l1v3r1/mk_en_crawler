ANKARA, Turkey -- A total of four people, two soldiers and two civilians, were injured late Saturday (July 18th) in a mortar attack on a military post in the southeastern province of Hakkari, near the Iraqi border, media reported on Sunday. 
Suspected members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) fired six mortar shells from Iraqi territory, the local governor's office said in a statement. 
Some landed in nearby fields, injuring two villagers. 
Just last week, the PKK announced that it will extend a unilateral ceasefire, declared on April 14th, until September 1st.

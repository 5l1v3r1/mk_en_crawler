BUCHAREST, Romania -- The two parties that form Romania's ruling coalition, the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) and the Social Democratic Party (PSD), clashed on Tuesday (June 9th) over the right to nominate the country's future representative in the European Commission (EC), media reported.
At a meeting of the ruling coalition, both parties claimed victory in Sunday's European Parliament elections.
The margin was razor thin:
the PSD got 31% of the vote, compared to 30% for the PDL.
Later, President Traian Basescu called on both parties to put aside the dispute "for the country's sake".
He warned that a public debate on this matter may undermine Romania's efforts to put together a healthy EC portfolio.

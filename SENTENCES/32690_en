BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian Parliament adopted a declaration Thursday (19 December) asking the EU authorities for further commitments to Romania's accession reforms. 
The bill welcomes the decision of the EU summit in Copenhagen last week to set a common objective for full membership for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. 
It also specifies that Romania will push for signing an Accession Treaty in the first half of 2004 and entering the Union 1 January 2007. 
According to the declaration, the rapid signing of the treaty would allow Romania to appoint observers in the European Parliament along with entry of the ten new member countries.

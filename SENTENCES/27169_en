LONDON, United Kingdom -- A court in London rejected on Wednesday (March 3rd) a request to release former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic on bail and will hold him until a hearing next week.
Ganic's lawyers vowed to appeal the decision.
Ganic was arrested on Monday at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade.
He is wanted there in connection with an attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy in May 1992, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.
Both BiH and Serbia have announced they will seek Ganic's extradition.

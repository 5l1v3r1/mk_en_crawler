ANKARA, Turkey -- Newly elected Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat said Tuesday (27 January) that reaching a referendum-based solution to the Cyprus dispute before 1 May would be an important development.
Speaking at a meeting of the Ankara Industry Chamber, he said resolving the dispute through referendum would guarantee the rights of all the citizens of the divided island.
Talat also said he is a firm supporter of the view that an agreement should be reached by the beginning of May when the southern part of the island joins the EU.

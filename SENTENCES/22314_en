ATHENS, Greece -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki on Sunday (August 10th) reiterated his country's demand for recognition of a Macedonian minority in Greece. 
In an interview with the Greek daily Eleftherotypia, Milososki said recognising "a small ethnic group" would pose no threat to Greece, adding the Macedonian minority has the right to freedom of expression and to preserve its language, national and cultural identity. 
He added, however, that the issue should not affect UN-sponsored talks on the name dispute between the two countries. 
A new round of talks on the issue begins on Thursday in New York.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Tuesday (16 September) that Turkey is doing everything it can to secure a date to start accession negotiations with the EU and should therefore be willing to compromise on the issue of Cyprus in last-minute negotiations. 
Election results from the Turkish part of Cyprus would be crucial to a peaceful solution, Simitis added. 
He reiterated Greece's support for the UN-proposed plan to resolve the dispute and reunite Cyprus.

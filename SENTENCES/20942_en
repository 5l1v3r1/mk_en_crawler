TIRANA, Albania -- A helicopter is believed to have crashed in the mountains of northern Albania early Tuesday (March 4th), about 300km southeast of Tirana, near the border with Kosovo. 
The ministries of interior and defence say an SOS message was received from an aircraft that disappeared from radar screens. 
Local media reports say people in the village of Rragam in the Tropoja district saw the helicopter crash on the peak of Jezerca, one of the highest mountains in Albania. 
Fog and fading light forced rescuers to suspend their search Tuesday evening.
In other news, police in Vlora announced the discovery Monday night of an arsenal of weapons and a cache of drugs. 
Police said the contraband was hidden in a bus in the village of Levan. 
Five people were arrested.

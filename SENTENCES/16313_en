BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers decided on Monday (November 13th) to delay a decision on reducing the number of their troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told the meeting that the situation in BiH already allows for a trimmed down military presence.
He urged the member-states not to make any decisions before December and to refrain from any cuts to EUFOR until at least February.
French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, meanwhile, said the force in BiH could be reduced "on condition that we maintain the ability to return in force quickly if the region, especially Kosovo, becomes unstable".

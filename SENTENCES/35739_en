LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- In a referendum held Saturday (3 April), voters overwhelmingly rejected a motion that would have restored the rights of 18,000 ethnic Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs who were deprived of their citizenship when the country broke away from Yugoslavia.
About 95 per cent of the people voted against the recommendation by the country's Constitutional Court.
According to polls, most feared the country would have to pay billions in damages if the motion passed.

TIRANA, Albania -- Thousands of supporters of the opposition Socialist Party rallied in downtown Tirana on Friday (September 19th) demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sali Berisha and his cabinet due to an ongoing investigation into the March 15th Gerdec ammunition depot blasts.
The explosions killed 26 people and injured over 300.
The government is investigating the case but argues the explosions were an accident.
One of the key witnesses in the investigation, Kosta Trebicka, was found dead this month near his car in a remote area, apparently after going on a hunting trip.(Makfax - 20/09/08;

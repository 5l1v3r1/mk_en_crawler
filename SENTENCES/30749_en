BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government amended a controversial provision Friday (March 11th) in a strategy to preserve and strengthen relations between Serbia and ethnic Serbs living in neighbouring countries.
The catalyst was sharp reaction from Montenegro.
Authorities in Podgorica sent a note to Belgrade protesting the provision.
They say it interfered in its internal affairs for declaring Serbs constituent people in Montenegro based on the model of Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Podgorica says that strategy contradicts the fundamental principles of good neighbourly relations.
The government in Belgrade decided to remove the provision about ensuring recognition of the political constituency of Serb people in Montenegro, and another provision that would require establishing the constituency of Serb people living in Croatia.

ATHENS, Greece -- US Ambassador to Greece Charles Ries says the agreement reached at the weekend between Cypriot President Tassos Papadopolous and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat represents progress. 
The leaders agreed to revive Cyprus reunification talks, stalled since Greek Cypriot voters rejected a plan sponsored by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2004. 
During talks Tuesday (11 July) with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, Ries also expressed Washington's belief that the renewed dialogue might result in a new approach to the issue.
In other news Tuesday, the Turkish media reported that the European Parliament's (EP) foreign affairs committee delayed until 4 September a discussion about a report on Turkey's progress in meeting its EU pre-accession obligations. 
It was to be debated this week. 
The postponement was due to the more than 400 submitted proposals for amendments to the document, most of them from Greek EP members.

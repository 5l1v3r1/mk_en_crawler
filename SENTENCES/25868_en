BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, is ruling out the possibility of a formal alliance among the largest opposition parties.
At a press conference Tuesday (February 16th), Kostunica said the current level of co-operation is enough to reach the common goal of bringing down the current government.
Kostunica said there is no need for another Democratic Opposition of Serbia, a broad front against Slobodan Milosevic, formed in the late 1990s.

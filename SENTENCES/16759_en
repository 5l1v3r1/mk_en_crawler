SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Petkov fired Ivan Ivanov, the top executive of the nuclear power plant in Kozloduy, on Tuesday (6 June) because of his continuing attempts to save two old reactors from closure. 
Bulgaria promised to shut down the 440-megawatt Soviet-era Reactors Three and Four on 31 December 2006. 
It closed two similar reactors in 2004 as part of the same bargain which secured the promise of EU membership. 
The European Commission last week demanded guarantees that Bulgaria would decommission the two reactors and dismantle the other two which are mothballed.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament endorsed in the first reading on Tuesday (November 21st) a key package of constitutional amendments related to the country's upcoming EU membership. 
The changes are aimed primarily at reforming the national judiciary. 
They include removing impeachment procedures for the presidents of the two supreme courts and the chief prosecutor, as well as introducing an inspectorate at the Supreme Judicial Council. 
They also introduce a degree of fiscal decentralisation, giving local governments the right to levy local taxes and determine tax rates. 
In addition, compulsory military service will be ended, and magistrates will lose their immunity.

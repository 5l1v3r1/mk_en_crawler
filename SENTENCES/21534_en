ATHENS, Greece -- Customs officers decided to end their strike at a meeting early Friday (September 26th). 
On Thursday, a court declared the strike illegal after the ministry of economy filed a complaint against the customs officers' trade union. 
The ministry insisted the strike caused "significant damage" to the state and the public, including major fuel shortages across the country. 
Customs officers were protesting the removal of a special account that provided about 3,500 of them with additional income every month.

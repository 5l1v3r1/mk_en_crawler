SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament continued to debate a bill on police Monday (October 2nd), after Friday's session was suspended due to bitter disagreement over the draft's content. 
Adoption of a new law is key to Macedonia's EU integration process. 
One sticking point is whether the bill must be adopted with a simple majority or under the so-called Badinter principle -- that is, with the support of most minority representatives in parliament. 
The largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union of Integration, opposes the bill, saying it fails to guarantee equal rights.

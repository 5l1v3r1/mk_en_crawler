PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR will reduce its contingent in Kosovo but will not withdraw completely, Commander Giuseppe Emilio Gay said on Tuesday (March 3rd). 
"We are in a phase of reducing our forces, and this will be carried out in every part of Kosovo," Gay said in Pristina. 
Belgrade-based daily Politika reported earlier on Tuesday that NATO intended to drastically reduce its staff in Kosovo by June, leaving only a "symbolic number of troops" there. 
Gay rejected these reports. 
"There will be only a reduction in the number of our contingent," he said, crediting the stable security situation.

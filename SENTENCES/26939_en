SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) arrested three people Thursday (November 5th) suspected of terrorism and illegal weapons trafficking.
Rijad Rustempasic, Abdulah Handzic and Edis Velic were originally detained in March 2008 but were released several months later for lack of evidence.
Prior to Thursday's arrests, prosecutors interrogated almost 70 witnesses and collected more than 1,000 pieces of evidence in BiH, Germany, Austria and other places.
On Thursday, police searched four locations in Sarajevo and Bugojno.

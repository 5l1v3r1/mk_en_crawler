Greece's 2005 budget, which Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis presented to parliament Thursday (18 November), suggests the cost of the Athens Olympics will likely exceed 11 billion euros -- more than double the initial projections.
Originally, Greece planned to spend 4.6 billion euros on the Summer Games.
Less than two months before the official opening on 13 August, Alogoskoufis said the bill was likely to hit the 6 billion euro.
That mark was subsequently surpassed as well.
"The cost of the Games is expected to reach 8.95 billion euros," the finance minister told reporters last week, acknowledging that not all figures were final.
W
ith the addition in the 2005 budget of 2.37 billion euros, the actual cost of the Games would stand at more than 11 billion euros.
That extra amount, according to the AP, covers infrastructure projects and other indirect public sector expenditures not included in the original Olympic budget.
Alogoskoufis explained the difference between the 9 billion euros announced last week and the new one as the result of a "very conservative estimate", which left out "other costs, such as the metro extension that was carried out urgently" for the Olympics.
The cost given in the 2005 budget for the metro extension project is 484m euros.
Others include 600m euros as carry-over construction costs, 560m euros for a suburban rail line and an estimated 731m euros in expenditures "to businesses and industries of the broader public sector".
The latest figure, however, does not include an estimated 267m euros reportedly spent for a tram line built mainly for the Olympics.
After years of delays in construction, Greece had to race against time to meet tight deadlines.
Spiraling costs dramatically inflated the bill, pushing the country's deficit to 5.3 per cent -- well above the 3 per cent ceiling set by the EU.
On Thursday, Alogoskoufis pledged to carve it to 2.8 per cent in 2005.
"
Our aim to reduce the deficit is ambitious, we'll make every effort to achieve it through a mild adjustment," Reuters quoted him as telling reporters as he presented the final version of the 2005 budget.
Seeking to reassure their EU partners about the country's commitment to the bloc's rules, the Greeks pledged Thursday that the 2005 budget would restore fiscal discipline, in part by reducing spending.
Under the new budget, expenditures will grow only 4.8 per cent next year, while there will be a 7.4 per cent growth in revenues.
Other budget projections include a GDP growth of 3.9 per cent in 2005, up from the 3.7 per cent projected for this year.
Inflation is expected to drop to 2.9 per cent next year from 3.1 per cent this year, and 3.4 per cent in 2003.
Another difficult issue confronting the economy is unemployment.
It is expected to grow to 10.5 per cent in 2005, before dropping to 9.8 per cent in 2006

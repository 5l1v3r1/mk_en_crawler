ANKARA, Turkey -- Ankara's high criminal court has ordered that Democratic Society Party (DTP) leader Ahmet Turk again be investigated for a February speech he made in parliament, delivering it in Kurdish.
The court's ruling annulled an earlier one by the prosecutor's office, which decided no lawsuit was needed.
The opposition Nationalist Movement Party had challenged the prosecutor's decision.
Turkish legislation bans making parliamentary speeches in languages other than Turkish, and state television cut away from Turk's speech while it was being broadcast live.
The probe is the second against the DTP leader within the last two months.
Earlier, an investigation was launched into controversial remarks he made comparing imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to Nelson Mandela.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry Monday (January 18th) rejected a formal ruling by the Armenian Constitutional Court that approves protocols to establish and develop formal diplomatic relations.
The short message, posted on the ministry's website, said parts of the ruling contain "preconditions and restrictive provisions which impair the letter and spirit of the protocols" signed in Geneva October 12th.
Foreign ministry sources in Ankara were quoted by local media as saying that references in the ruling to the World War I era "genocide" of Armenians also violated the essence of the documents signed in October.
Experts said that the Constitutional Court's decision explicitly states that mutual obligations undertaken by the two countries "are, under the principles of international law, exclusively of a bilateral nature", ruling out any link between the normalisation process and relations between Yerevan and Ankara on one hand and Azerbaijan on the other.

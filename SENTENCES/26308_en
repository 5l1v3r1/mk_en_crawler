STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday (March 16th) that Croatia has discriminated against 15 Roma children by denying them the right to attend classes along with other pupils. 
Discriminatory cases have been reported in primary schools in Orehovica, Podturen and Trnovac where these pupils were put in separate classes. 
The state was sentenced to pay 4,500 euros per person and 10,000 euros in costs and expenses. 
The Strasbourg-based court however has acknowledged that Croatia is exerting efforts to guarantee school access for Roma children.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament (EP) official Hannes Swoboda said on Thursday (May 13th) that one solution for Serbs in northern Kosovo would be broad autonomy, similar to that offered Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), based on the Dayton Peace Accord.
In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Dnevnik, Swoboda said this would require the Serb-dominated northern part of Kosovo to be the joint responsibility of Belgrade and Pristina.
"We need a solution that would not question Kosovo's independence, but would secure wide autonomy for Serbs," Swoboda said.
He is vice-chairman of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group in the EP.

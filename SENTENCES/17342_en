NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A poll conducted at the request of the UN suggests that neither Greek Cypriots nor Turkish Cypriots expect reunification of the ethnically divided island in the near future. 
According to results released on Tuesday (April 24th), 57% of Greek Cypriots and 70% of Turkish Cypriots are pessimistic about prospects for reunification.
However, a significant number -- 65% of Greek Cypriots and 70% of Turkish Cypriots -- indicated they view a federal settlement as "the second best option, and would be prepared to accept such a constitutional framework, at the very least as a compromise solution," the survey found. 
It was conducted by the CYMAR Market Research and Prologue Consulting agency between January and February 2007.

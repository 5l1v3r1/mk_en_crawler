PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- The election commission decided Monday (30 December) that the repeat presidential elections will be held on 9 February.
The results of the 22 December election were declared invalid because voter turnout fell below the required 50 per cent.
All 11 candidates say they will run again.
Acting President Filip Vujanovic of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists won the first attempt handily.

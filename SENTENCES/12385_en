BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court decided on Wednesday (6 July) to return the government's bills for the judicial and property reforms to parliament for revision. 
The ruling came in response to three appeals submitted separately by two opposition parties and the High Court of Appeals and Justice. 
The constitutional judges agreed that some provisions of the legislation violate the country's main law and need to be re-examined.

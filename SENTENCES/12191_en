THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal spokesman Jim Landale again called for the transfer of the remaining Serb generals wanted by the tribunal.
In a statement to local news agency Beta on Friday (11 February), Landale refused to comment on whether the tribunal plans to send a medical team to Belgrade to examine generals Sreten Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic, as Serbia has requested.
A third general, Vladimir Lazarevic, surrendered and was extradited earlier this month.
In other news Friday, following talks in Podgorica, Montenegrin Interior Minister Dragan Djurovic and his Republika Srpska (RS) counterpart, Darko Matijasevic, told reporters at a joint news conference that Hague indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were not hiding in Montenegro or RS.
They also expressed doubt that the two Bosnian Serb fugitives were in Serbia.

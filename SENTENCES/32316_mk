THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague on Tuesday (1 October) published Croatia's appeal against the arrest warrant for Gen Janko Bobetko. 
The appeal describes the warrant as legally unfounded and inconsistent, given the 83-year old Bobetko's health. 
Croat legal experts maintain the tribunal should have first submitted evidence and a written note explaining the need for detention. 
Arrest and detention, they say, could kill Bobetko. 
Officials included the results of medical exams performed on him last month to bolster their claim. 
The charges stem from the murder of Serbs during a Croat offensive in 1993.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Monday (October 18th) that he expects the European Commission (EC) will acknowledge Macedonia's efforts and achievements in its report next month on progress in the EU integration process. 
"We gave our maximum in the past year to move the country forward in all fields, and there is progress," Gruevski said. 
As for the longstanding name dispute with neighbouring Greece that remains a hurdle, he said he would agree to a meeting with Greek counterpart George Papandreou prior to NATO's November summit in Lisbon.

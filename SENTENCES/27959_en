BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament issued a statement Wednesday (September 22nd) criticising France's Roma repatriation policy and accusing the country of serious civil rights violations.
According to the document, the repatriation of Roma violates "the right of free movement for all European citizens, regardless of nationality or race".
The lawmakers urged President Traian Basescu and the government to "take all the political and diplomatic measures needed for protecting the rights of Romanian nationals as European citizens".
Basescu, meanwhile, said on Wednesday he has asked French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy to stop the expulsion drive.
Speaking to foreign journalists in Bucharest, Basescu said that the answer he received "was not clear" but added the issue will be revisited.

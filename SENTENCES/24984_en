PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Most suspended Serb police officers reported to duty on Tuesday (June 30th), the deadline set by Kosovo police.
A total of 325 Serbs decided to return, ending their protest of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence in February 2008.
Only 18 failed to return.
A EULEX statement said the move as "an important step toward the establishment of a multiethnic police service, which works for the benefit and security of all communities in Kosovo, including the Serb community".
In other news Tuesday, Kosovo signed an agreement with Italy to fight organised crime, including money-laundering and terrorism.
The agreement is Kosovo's first with an EU member state.
The same day, former Prime Minister Agim Ceku returned to Kosovo from Bulgaria, after a court in Kyustendil decided not to continue detaining him.
Police arrested him on the Bulgarian-Macedonian border last week, based on an Interpol arrest warrant issued by Serbia.
He is accused of war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo.

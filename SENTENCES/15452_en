ANKARA, Turkey -- A radical Kurdish group on Tuesday (25 April) claimed responsibility for last week's bombing in Istanbul that injured 31 people. 
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) threatened to "continue to increase the scale of violence". 
Turkish officials say the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) is using TAK as a front to carry out attacks on civilian targets. 
But the PKK insists that TAK is a splinter faction over which it has no control.

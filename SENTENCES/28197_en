NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met on Thursday (November 18th) in New York with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu.
He said that both agreed to work "quickly and decisively" to jumpstart stalled negotiations on reunifying the divided island.
"We have just had a constructive exchange of views on the core issues, including governance and power-sharing, economy, EU matters, property, territory and security," Ban said.
"The peace talks on Cyprus were losing momentum and needed a boost if the two sides are to reach a settlement while there is still the time and the political opportunity to do so," he added.
Ban also noted that the "people of Cyprus and [the] international community want a solution, not endless talks." (UN news centre, CNA, Xinhua - 18/11/10)

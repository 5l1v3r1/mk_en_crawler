ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court on Friday (February 16th) sentenced seven Islamic militants with ties to al-Qaeda to life in prison for terrorist strikes in Istanbul that killed 52 people in November 2003.
The seven are among 74 suspects in the attacks, which targeted two synagogues, the British consulate and the HSBC bank.
The court acquitted 26 people and sentenced the remaining defendants to up to 18 years in prison.
Among those given life sentences was Syrian Loa'i Mohammad Haj Bakr al-Saqa, the mastermind of the plot.
Prosecutors say he received money and orders personally from Osama bin Laden.

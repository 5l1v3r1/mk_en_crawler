BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana said Monday (15 December) that people indicted for war crimes should not run in elections, a reference to four war crimes suspects registered for the 28 December parliamentary elections: Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, former Yugoslav Chief of Staff General Nebojsa Pavkovic and Serbian Deputy Interior Minister Sreten Lukic. 
Milosevic and Seselj are in the tribunal's detention facility in The Hague. 
Solana said Serbia has a choice between moving closer to the EU or towards isolation. 
The OSCE mission in Belgrade meanwhile urged the public to exercise "their hard-won democratic right to vote" in the elections. 
An estimated 6.5 million people are eligible to vote.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish warplanes pounded targets across the border in Iraq, according to reports Wednesday (October 24th), including a Kurdish village near Shiranish Islam. 
Officials in Ankara confirm that several bombing raids were carried out this week and that a unit of 300 troops briefly entered Iraqi territory in pursuit of guerrillas from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
Planes reportedly took off from the airfield in Diyarbakir early Thursday, though officials would not say whether they were bound for Iraqi airspace.
In an effort to diffuse the situation, a high-level Iraqi delegation is visiting Ankara on Thursday to discuss measures aimed at stopping PKK attacks on Turkish troops. 
The military says there was another one on a military post in Hakkari province late Wednesday, involving about 40 PKK rebels from Iraq.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul said on Thursday that Ankara is determined to end the PKK threat. 
"Although we respect the territorial integrity and unity of Iraq, Turkey is running out of patience and will not tolerate the use of Iraqi soil for the purpose of terrorist activities." The Turkish National Security Council met on Wednesday and decided to impose economic sanctions against organisations suspected of financing and assisting the PKK.
Also Wednesday, officials in the European Parliament urged Turkey to think twice before launching a military incursion into northern Iraq. 
However, they stressed that the international community should support Turkey in its efforts to counter terrorism.

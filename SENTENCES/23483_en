BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu sent a letter to parliament Monday (December 22nd) asking to extend the Romanian troop deployment in Iraq.
In the letter addressed to the heads of the two chambers of parliament, Basescu asked for their consent to keep the troops in Iraq in 2009 at the request of the Iraqi government.
Romania's participation there and elsewhere will further enhance co-operation with NATO and the EU, he added.

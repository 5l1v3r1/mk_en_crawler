SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government on Tuesday (June 2nd) rejected media reports suggesting Skopje may withdraw its recognition of Kosovo's independence.
"Recognition was a very delicate process, which went through all the necessary procedures, and in the end was endorsed with a resolution by parliament," government Spokesperson Sherif Duraku said.
Separately, Janusz Bugajski, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, also denied the speculation, stressing that he never said Macedonia may withdraw its recognition.
Recently, several Balkan media outlets reported Bugajski has hinted at such a possibility.

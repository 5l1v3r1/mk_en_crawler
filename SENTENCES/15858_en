SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling on Thursday (October 19th) summoned the state's influential party leaders to discuss the reform agenda and all the open issues. 
The members of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), numerous ambassadors and US Deputy Undersecretary of State Rosemary DiCarlo also attended.
According to an spokesperson for Schwarz-Schilling, the international community's message is clear -- it is not important who will be in the next government, but it is necessary that it be formed as soon as possible in order to immediately launch the EU-related reform agenda.

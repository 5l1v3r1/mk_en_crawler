WASHINGTON, United States -- Immediate action is required to prevent an AIDS epidemic in the Balkans, according to a World Bank study released Friday (11 July). 
Focusing on case studies from Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, it concluded that the countries share several social conditions that have led to a rapid increase in HIV infection. 
These include high unemployment and significant poverty, rapid social changes, a decrease in the quality of health services and educational opportunities, increased population mobility, and increased substance abuse and commercial sex.

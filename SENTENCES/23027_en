NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus has decided to terminate legal activities at the European Court of Justice aimed at blocking some EU financial aid to Turkish Cypriots, government spokesman Stefanos Stefanu announced on Tuesday (June 3rd). 
The move frees up about 10m of the 259m euros in financial aid the EU has approved to help the Turkish community on the divided island. 
Efforts to reunify Cyprus resumed earlier this year with the election of President Demetris Christofias.

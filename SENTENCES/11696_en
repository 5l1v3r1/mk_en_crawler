BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament is discussing an initiative Tuesday (21 June) by the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) for a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's coalition cabinet. 
PSD cites strong disagreement with the government's draft amendments to judicial and property legislation. 
PSD says the measures would negatively affect Romania's EU bid.
In other news, President Traian Basescu says Romania is prepared to give up part of its EU financial aid, if this would help resolve the current budget battle among the 25 EU member states. 
The ten newest EU countries also have suggested cutting their designated budget funding.

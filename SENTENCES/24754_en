THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Peter Robinson, the legal adviser to former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, is requesting certain documents from the German government to bolster his client's defence, media reported on Sunday (May 3rd).
The documents could confirm that the western powers had considered the possibility of a war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, long before Karadzic, who is facing trial at The Hague tribunal, rose to power.
The request was sent through the German Embassy in the Netherlands.
Meanwhile, the head of Serbia's council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Sunday that his country hopes to arrest the remaining two war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, by the end of this year.
He stressed that local security services are doing all they can to apprehend the pair and that Mladic is their top priority.

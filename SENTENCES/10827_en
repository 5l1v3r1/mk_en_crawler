SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At the opening of the 6th BiH-EU inter-parliamentary meeting Wednesday (3 November), the head of the European Parliament delegation, Doris Pack, said the delegates were generally pleased with the progress achieved in meeting the EU Feasibility Study requirements.
She said the country has implemented 13 out of 16 set reform points and adopted 30 out of 40 bills highlighted as priorities in the study.
Pack warned, however, that more must be done to implement political reforms at the state level.
She also said the major problem in BiH remains Republika Srpska's failure to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.

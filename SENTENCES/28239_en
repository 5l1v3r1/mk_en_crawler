SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Administrative Court on Monday (October 18th) acquitted Ahmed Dogan, leader of the opposition ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), in a major corruption trial.
The case opened in September after a parliamentary panel found a possible conflict of interest concerning Dogan.
He received about 1m euros for consulting on hydro power projects in 2008 and 2009, when his party was in power as a coalition partner.
However, he failed to make public his link to the company that hired him.
According to the parliamentary commission investigating the case, Dogan also lacked the qualifications necessary to act as a consultant in the projects, prompting investigators to suspect corruption.
But in its ruling Monday, the court found there was no evidence suggesting Dogan violated the public interest by receiving the fees.
The parliamentary commission says it will appeal the ruling.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The leader of the New Kosovo Alliance party, Bexhet Pacolli, has met with Libyan leader Muammar al Gaddafi, in his continuing effort to lobby for international recognition of Kosovo's independence, local media reported Thursday (September 10th).
In Tripoli, Pacolli, a powerful businessman, asked Gaddafi to consider establishing lines of co-operation between Kosovo and Libya.
It may be a tough sell however, given the solid ties between Serbia and Libya, local media noted.
Pacolli says his lobbying efforts have resulted in recognition by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the Maldives, the Dominican Republic and other countries.

ATHENS, Greece -- Several individuals are in police custody following a Friday (11 November) incident in which anarchists vandalised the French Institute in Athens, spraying paint and smashing windows.
A similar attack took place Thursday at the French Institute in Thessaloniki.
Police across the country are on alert, amid fears of further copycat attacks spurred by the ongoing disruptions in France.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Iraq has agreed to pay $360m of the $1.86 billion it owes Bulgaria by June 2008, Bulgarian Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski announced on Sunday (November 11th).
Sofia will write off the balance, he added, in compliance with a decision by the Paris Club of creditor states to write off 80% of Iraqi debt.
Most other nations, he said, agreed to accept payments in 23-year government bonds with a six-year grace period, but none were able to recoup more than 20% of the money Iraq owed.

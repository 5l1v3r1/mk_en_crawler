PORTOROZ, Slovenia -- Croatian Foreign Ministry State Secretary Hido Biscevic said Tuesday (8 June) he expects Italy to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Croatia and the EU by the end of June. 
Biscevic made the statement during the two-day Stability Pact for South East Europe meeting. 
Italy had balked at signing after Croatia declared a unilateral protected fishing zone in the Adriatic. 
The only other holdout, the United Kingdom, is expected to sign the SAA soon as well.

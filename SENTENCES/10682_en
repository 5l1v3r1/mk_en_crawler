THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The EU, Britain and the United States issued separate statements on Sunday (10 October), praising Serbian authorities for the transfer of Bosnian Serb ex-military officer Ljubisa Beara to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
They also stressed that other indictees should follow this example.
Beara, indicted for crimes and genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, was turned over to the tribunal on Saturday.
He is expected to appear before the court this week.
Still unclear, however, is whether he was apprehended or surrendered.
Tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann says Beara was arrested by the Serbian police but did not resist.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Senior Iranian and Iraqi officials arrived in Ankara on Tuesday (February 20th) on separate visits, part of Turkey's efforts to contribute to regional stabilisation. 
According to press reports, a two-day visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has focused on the situation in the Middle East, Iraq, and Iran's nuclear programme, in light of a UN Security Council deadline for ending uranium enrichment work. 
Bilateral economic ties were also on the agenda.
Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi also began a two-day visit to Turkey, amid recent tension between the two countries over the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the planned referendum in Iraq's oil-rich city, Kirkuk. 
Meeting with Mahdi, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan again urged authorities to eliminate PKK bases in northern Iraq. 
Erdogan, whose country is concerned that Iraqi Kurds would take control of Kirkuk, also urged Mahdi to postpone the referendum.

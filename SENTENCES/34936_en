ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul on Monday (15 December) congratulated Turkish Cypriots for the democratic elections carried out in the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" late last week.
Gul congratulated President Rauf Denktas and the leaders of the four parties that entered parliament as result of the elections.
As for the effect of the Cyprus dispute on Turkey's EU membership bid, Gul said finding a solution would help greatly but is not a prerequisite for opening membership negotiations, as it is not part of the Copenhagen political criteria.

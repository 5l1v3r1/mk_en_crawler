SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH's Parliamentary House of Representatives held its inaugural session in Sarajevo on Wednesday (4 December).
A total of 18 parties are represented in the 98-member institution following the October general elections.
The vote for parliament speaker suggests that the nationalist Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and the Croat Democratic Union (HDZ) may secure a tight majority with the support of minor parties.
SDA's Muhamed Ibrahimovic was elected parliamentary chairman and HDZ's Josip Merdzo as his deputy.
Meanwhile, High Representative Paddy Ashdown traveled to The Hague, where he testified Wednesday in the case against Momir Talic and Radoslav Brdjanin.
Ashdown appeared as a witness for the prosecution, describing what he saw during his visits to the Serb-run camps of Manjaca and Trnopolje in early August 1992.

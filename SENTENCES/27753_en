BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU enlargement will be among the priorities of Belgium's presidency of the 27-nation bloc, which starts Thursday (July 1st). 
Prime Minister Yves Leterme and Foreign Minister Steven Vanackere presented the programme of the six-month presidency last week. 
Leterme noted that his country is a fervent supporter of the EU integration process, while Vanackere stressed that each country must meet necessary criteria and implement required reforms before being invited to join the Union. 
While acknowledging that Croatia is close to achieving its EU membership goal, they did not commit to an actual time frame. 
As for visa liberalisation for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, Vanackere said the issue could be discussed in September. 
He predicted that the EU will probably review Serbia's EU membership application around that same time.

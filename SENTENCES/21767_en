ATHENS, Greece -- Three people were injured on Sunday (April 20th) after a clash between striking emigrant farm workers and farmers on the Greek island of Peloponnese. 
Police say landowners and their supporters squared off in the village of Nea Manolada against strawberry pickers backed by trade union members and activists sent by the Greek Communist Party. 
They had gathered for a protest in the village's main square, demanding a raise from 23 to 30 euros a day. 
Hundreds of seasonal workers, most of them foreigners, work the farms on Peloponnese, one of the biggest strawberry producers in Greece.

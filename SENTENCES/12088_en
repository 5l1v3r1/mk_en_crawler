ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal deputy chief prosecutor David Tolbert told Voice of America on Saturday (15 January) that Croatian General Ante Gotovina must appear before The Hague tribunal.
Tolbert was commenting on the possibility of Gotovina being tried instead in Croatia, amid rumours the fugitive general is seeking a deal for his surrender.
Meanwhile, in an interview with Vecernji list published on Saturday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated his hope that Croatia would fulfil its international obligations, including the hand-over of Gotovina to The Hague.
Full co-operation is the major condition for starting EU accession talks with Zagreb in March.

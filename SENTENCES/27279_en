SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Russian Ambassador to Sarajevo Aleksander Bocan-Harchenko said on Sunday (November 1st) that Moscow supports BiH's territorial integrity and sovereignty. 
In an interview with FTV, he said Russia still believes that there is a chance for agreement regarding reforms among leaders of the Muslim, Serb and Croat communities. 
Bocan-Harcenko stressed that changes to the constitution can only be made by BiH, and that the international community just acts as an advisor. 
The United States and the EU held two rounds of talks on constitutional reforms at Camp Butmir, near Sarajevo, last month, gathering leaders of the seven main political parties in the country. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov plans to visit BiH on Thursday.

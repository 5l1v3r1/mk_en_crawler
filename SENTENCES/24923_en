TIRANA, Albania -- Four workers with the US-Turkish consortium Bechtel-Enka suffered serious injuries Tuesday (December 30th) in a cave-in at the Thirra tunnel, part of the Durres-Kukes Highway project in northern Albania, media reported. 
The tunnel in which the four men -- three Turks and an Albanian -- were working collapsed and buried them. 
The Turks went to a hospital in Prizren, Kosovo, while emergency crews transported the Albanian to Tirana for treatment. 
He is in a coma.

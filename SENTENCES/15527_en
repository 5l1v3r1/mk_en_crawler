NEW YORK, United States -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Friday (22 September) that the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- would get a signal at the November summit in Riga regarding their NATO integration prospects. 
Although no decision on the three states' membership would be made at Riga, they will be given a clear signal that the Alliance's doors remain open, he said.
In related news, Bosnian Deputy Defence Minister Enes Becirbasic told a conference in Sarajevo that his country expects a positive signal at the summit about its bid to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.

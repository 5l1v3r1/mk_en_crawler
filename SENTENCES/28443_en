ANKARA, Turkey -- The army announced on Wednesday (June 16th) that Turkish troops have crossed the border into northern Iraq for the first time in two years, attacking targets of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and killing four members.
The move was in response to a PKK attack against border guards in the southeast Turkish province of Sirnak.
The army says one Turkish soldier was killed in that attack, which lasted several hours.
PKK members who fled back across the border were pursued by Turkish commandos and special forces.
In addition, Turkish fighter jets bombed a group of militants and PKK positions deeper in northern Iraq.

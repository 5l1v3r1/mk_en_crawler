PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX and Kosovo police are investigating claims by a man who says he participated in 17 cases of murder, attempted murder, and torture since 1999. 
Nazim Bllaca says the crimes occurred while he worked at the Kosovo Information Service, an intelligence agency that is believed to be close to the ruling Democratic Party (PDK). 
He issued a press statement Sunday (November 29th) near the parliament building in Pristina, where several days ago his confessions were mentioned by an opposition lawmaker, who accused PDK officials of "ordering killings and torture".
Bllaca claimed that several senior state, party and police officials are involved in criminal cases in which he has provided witness testimony. 
After that parliament session at which the opposition member made the revelation, Bllaca says gunmen fired at his home near Lipjan/Lipljane. 
He says he has given authorities a CD containing everything he knows. 
The PDK says his allegations are groundless.

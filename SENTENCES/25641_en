SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As expected, Ivan Iskrov was nominated to a second term as Central Bank governor Thursday (August 20th), this time by the ruling party -- the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB). 
Parliament is expected to vote on it next week. 
For procedural reasons, he had to formally resign first, ending his term, before he could be re-appointed.

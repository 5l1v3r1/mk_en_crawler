PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has submitted a dossier to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with documents and other materials regarding Kosovo's independence declaration, media reported on Friday (April 24th).
The dossier consists of 2,900 pages of documents dating back to March 1998, the time of the UN's first involvement in the Kosovo issue.
The reports, minutes, agreements and other comments aim to shed light on the process of evaluating the legality of Kosovo's independence, which Serbia has challenged before the ICJ.
In other news, UN spokesperson Brendon Varma confirmed that the Security Council has received a request from Kosovo's government to close down UNMIK and leave the country.
Varma noted however, it is up to the council to decide.
On Wednesday, President Fatmir Sejdiu said UNMIK's presence is no longer required.

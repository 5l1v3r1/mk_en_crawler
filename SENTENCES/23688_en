ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities on Thursday (May 21st) took Prodromos Mavrides, former director of Siemens' Greek branch, into custody on charges of bribery and money laundering. 
According to media reports, the charges stem from contracts signed in 1997 between Germany's Siemens and Greece's largest telecom company, OTE. 
Prosecutors also issued an international arrest warrant for Siemens' former chief executive in Greece, Michalis Christoforakos, as he failed to appear to respond to charges in the same case. 
Media reports have suggested some politicians and their parties are involved, receiving bribes in exchange for awarding lucrative contracts to Siemens.

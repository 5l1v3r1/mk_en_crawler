PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Minister for European Integration Gordana Djurovic says Montenegro will reply to the European Commission's (EC) questionnaire by November, local media reported on Sunday (August 30th).
She noted that all relevant institutions have been working hard over the past several weeks to respond in time.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn delivered the questionnaire in July, regarding democratic reforms and implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Montenegro.
Podgorica must reply to more than 2,100 questions.
Based on those answers, the EU will assess the country's readiness for membership.
Montenegro hopes to obtain candidate status next year and launch accession talks by 2011.

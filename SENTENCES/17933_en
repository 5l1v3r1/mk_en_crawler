ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament adopted a new law Friday (December 15th) on financing political parties and independent candidates, banning contributions from anonymous donors and funding from state bodies and public companies.
The new legislation also prohibits parties from accepting money from citizens and companies with debts to the government, or from trade unions and employers' associations, religious communities, humanitarian groups and other non-profit organisations.
The government proposed the measure in a bid to reduce corruption.
In other news, Croatia's Foreign and European Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic confirmed at the weekend that prosecutors are investigating the alleged involvement of Croatian diplomats in drug smuggling.
Local media reported late last week that the Ministry covered up a scandal involving an employee of the Croatian consulate in Los Angeles, whose husband was detained last year while buying drugs and sentenced to probation by a US court.

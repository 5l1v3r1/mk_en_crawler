SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Tax inspectors shut down 248 businesses and facilities in a four-day sweep against tax evasion, the Federation Tax Administration said Saturday (7 June). 
On Friday alone, officials closed 20 businesses in Sarajevo. 
Owners will be sanctioned for failing to issue receipts, thus evading tax payment. 
The law also provides for sanctions against customers who do not request receipts. 
The operation is part of a campaign launched last week.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- By recognising Kosovo's independence two weeks ago, Montenegro directly interfered with Serbia's affairs, Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (October 23rd). 
Serbia, however, will not do the same by commenting on protests in Montenegro against that recognition, Tadic added. 
He said he has no message for Montenegrin opposition parties because, as president, he communicates only with other countries' governments. 
He insists Podgorica's decision is a violation of international law and has an impact on Kosovo's independence. 
"Montenegro was not the deciding factor, but after the recognition it assumed some of the responsibility," Tadic said. 
He added that recognition by a neighbour is much more significant than that by countries that do not border Serbia.

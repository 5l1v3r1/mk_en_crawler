STRASBOURG, France -- The president of the Council of Europe's (CoE) Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, Giovanni Di Stassi, warned Tirana of the risks posed by a new draft law that restricts the competencies of local government authorities in the field of urban planning.
Di Stassi voiced his surprise that nothing was said about the law while he was visiting Tirana earlier this month.
He also said a monitoring report on the situation of local and regional democracy in Albania would be relevant and useful.

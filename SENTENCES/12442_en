SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A NATO unit searched the home of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic's sister, a spokesman reported Tuesday (8 March). 
The raid took place in the town of Vojkovici, near Sarajevo. 
No incidents were reported. 
This was the first action by NATO troops in BiH since the transfer of the Alliance's peacekeeping operation to the EU.
Also Tuesday, Republika Srpska (RS) Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic said authorities are working to contact wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and insist on his surrender to The Hague tribunal. 
Matijasevic says his ministry would not hesitate to arrest Karadzic if he is on RS territory.

NEW YORK, United States -- Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz gave a positive assessment of Croatia's war crimes co-operation in his regular report to the UN Security Council on Thursday (June 4th).
Local media had expected the wording to be much more critical, as Zagreb failed to submit so-called "artillery diaries" for use in trials against several Croatian indictees, including General Ante Gotovina.
Brammertz pointed out that Croatia responded in a timely fashion to most tribunal requests, aside from some related to 1995's Operation Storm.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader met with Brammertz earlier this week in New York.
In his report on Serbia, Brammertz said authorities had fulfilled all demands for access to archives, documents and witnesses.
He also noted that co-operation levels have improved, especially as the heads of the main security agencies were replaced.
However, Brammertz stressed that a key issue -- the arrest of remaining war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic -- is unresolved.
Serbian chief war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic described the report as objective.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The two chambers of parliament decided on Monday (April 23rd) to hold the national referendum on President Traian Basescu's impeachment on May 19th, not on May 20th, as announced by Acting President Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
The Secretary of the Deputies Chamber, Ioan Munteanu, said the 20th exceeds the legal period of 30 days after the impeachment vote. 
The MPs will be responsible for approving the exact wording on the ballots. 
It will likely ask, "Do you agree with the impeachment of Romania's president?" Basescu's Democratic Party plans to organise his campaign, stressing it stands firmly behind him.
The first poll regarding the process, conducted by Antena 3 TV, suggests 57% of the public approve of Basescu's decision not to resign and force snap elections. 
Some 52% say they plan to vote in the referendum.

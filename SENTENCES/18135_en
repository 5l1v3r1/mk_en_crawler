BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic are visiting several EU countries this week to drum up support for Serbia's position on Kosovo, as the UN Security Council discusses a new draft resolution on final status.
On Monday, Kostunica is in Portugal, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency.
Jeremic, meanwhile, will visit Ljubljana, Vienna, Madrid and Lisbon for what his office describes as talks on stability in the Balkans.
The diplomatic offensive comes as the EU stands poised to take over Kosovo's administration from the UN.
In other news, Serbian Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic kicked off a tour of the Balkans on Friday, stopping first in Podgorica, where he discussed Serbia's proposal for regulating double citizenship.
On Monday, he begins a two-day visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina before heading on to Slovenia and Macedonia.

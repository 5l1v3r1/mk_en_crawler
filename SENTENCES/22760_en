PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Negotiations on the status of Kosovo are done, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier said Tuesday (July 8th) in northern Mitrovica.
"Now we are entering a new stage of solving problems," he said during his first visit to northern Kosovo since his arrival in the country last month.
Also on Tuesday, the director general of the Political Directorate with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mark Lyall Grant, paid a visit to Pristina.
He said neither Britain nor the international Contact Group would endorse Serb parallel structures in Kosovo.
"Our stance is clear -- division is not an option," Grant said.
The same day, a co-ordination council for the rule of law was established in Pristina.
Its co-chairs are Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci and EULEX commander Yves de Kermabon.

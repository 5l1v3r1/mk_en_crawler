TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian Defence Minister Pandeli Majko said on Friday (5 September) that his country wants to take part in EU's mission in neighbouring Macedonia. 
"Albania wishes to contribute to the stability of Macedonia and its participation in the European military force would have a very positive significance for the entire Balkan region," he said. 
Majko first made this proposal at a meeting in Sofia with his Macedonian counterpart, Vlado Buckovski. 
Skopje has so far not reacted to Tirana's proposal. 
Albania has sent small units to peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Meanwhile, Albanian parliamentary speaker Servet Pellumbi said that parliament strongly condemns recent attempts by the Albanian National Army to destablise Macedonia. 
Meeting with Macedonian Ambassador Eleonora Karanfilovska Ratcliff on Friday, Pellumbi urged closer co-operation between lawmakers of the two countries, especially with regard to defence and security issues.
In related news, police in Macedonia confirmed they have withdrawn from the north-west Lipkovo region, saying the situation there has started to return to normal. 
Villagers are also returning to their homes as tension eases, the interior ministry added. 
Police blockaded the area earlier this week in an attempt to catch a suspected ANA leader.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish General Staff announced on Tuesday (February 26th) that its ground offensive against terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party's (PKK) bases in northern Iraq has been restricted, though not completely halted, by heavy snow in the mountainous region.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended the operation, citing a "legitimate right of self-defence".
Speaking to his Justice and Development Party's parliamentary group, Erdogan said the PKK threatens peace and stability in Turkey.
The United States, meanwhile, has once again called Tuesday on Turkey to keep its operation as short as possible.
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, however, refused to define any specific time frame.
She added that Washington supports both Turkey and Iraq.
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates is expected to arrive in Ankara today for high-level talks.

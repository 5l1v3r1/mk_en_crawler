BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, along with Sports Minister Snezana Markovic-Samardzic and the head of the football federation, Tomislav Karadzic, must appear in court on December 1st to face charges of drinking champagne at a stadium.
In October, media published photos of the three holding glasses of champagne following Serbia's 5-0 victory over Romania in a World Cup qualifier.
The fine for drinking alcohol at sports events ranges from $150 to $1,500.
Tadic has said that he will pay the fine if judges find him guilty.
He insists he made a toast with the champagne but did not drink it.

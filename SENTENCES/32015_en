ZAGREB, Croatia -- A refugee return project worth 23.2m euros will officially begin in Zagreb on Tuesday (22 October). 
It is part of the CARDS programme funded by the European Commission. 
Its reconstruction programme aims to create conditions for refugee return in areas of special concern. 
The EC already has invested 59m euros in the programme, which has enabled the return of more than 10,000 refugees. 
This year's CARDS refugee return programme has four components - the reconstruction of housing units, economic revival, mine removal and support for NGOs.

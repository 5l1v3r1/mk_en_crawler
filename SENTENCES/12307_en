TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Katriot Islami said Thursday (10 February) that the EU should conclude talks on signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement as soon as possible, preferably before this summer's general elections.
That would send a "very positive signal" to all those in politics, Islami said.
In other news Thursday, local media reported that the major parties appear closer to an agreement on election law.
EU security chief Javier Solana has been urging them to overcome differences and reach a consensus.

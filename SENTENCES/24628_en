ZAGREB, Croatia -- In Wednesday's (January 7th) edition of Jutarnji List, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said that unless the border dispute with Croatia ends in Ljubljana's favour, his country may hold a popular referendum on Croatia's EU accession bid.
Twice during the past six months, Slovenia blocked the opening of new chapters in Zagreb's EU accession talks.
Croatia hopes to complete its talks by the end of this year and join the EU in 2010.
Commenting Wednesday on Zbogar's statement, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said that holding a referendum on his country's EU bid would not be "politically wise".

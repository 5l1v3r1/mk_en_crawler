PODGORICA, Yugoslavia -- Polls opened in Montenegro on Sunday (20 October) in a vote that could determine the republic's future and its alliance with Serbia. 
About 455,000 registered voters must elect the 75 deputies in the Montenegrin assembly. 
Seven coalitions and three political parties are running. 
President Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists is seen as the frontrunner. 
It advocates a loose coalition with Serbia as provided for under the EU-mediated agreement reached earlier this year. 
The other key contender is the Coalition for Change, led by the Socialist Party. 
It too has said that it will honour the deal establishing the future federation, but insists on closer ties with Serbia. 
The Liberal Alliance, which toppled the previous government over support of the plan, is hoping to win enough backing for a fully independent state. 
Preliminary vote results are expected late Sunday.

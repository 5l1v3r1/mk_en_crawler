TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Tuesday (April 15th) that constitutional changes cannot be based on a short-term whim but must instead be mature and reviewed carefully. 
He was responding to heated debate among the main political parties on constitutional changes to the electoral system and the responsibilities and mandates of the president and the prime minister. 
Topi stressed, "I'm not against the changes, but ... 
not changes made for the sake of political interests."
In other news Tuesday, Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha formally signed Albania's invitation to join NATO. 
Albania and Croatia were offered membership at the summit in Bucharest two weeks ago.

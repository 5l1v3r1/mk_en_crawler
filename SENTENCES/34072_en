PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN spokesman Andrea Angeli said Wednesday (23 July) that Serbian authorities have returned the bodies of 43 ethnic Albanians killed during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. 
The remains were found in a mass grave in Batajnica, near Belgrade, after the overthrow of the Milosevic regime. 
The victims were identified by comparing DNA samples with those of relatives. 
More than 800 bodies have so far been found in Serbia.
Russia, meanwhile, announced that it pulled the last of its troops out of the Balkans on Wednesday. 
Moscow had about 1,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but withdrew them to cut costs.

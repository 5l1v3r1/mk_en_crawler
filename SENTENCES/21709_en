THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's prosecutors submitted a new, abbreviated version of the indictment against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Tuesday (September 23rd).
It, as the operative one from 2000 does, includes 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
But the contents of the counts have been restructured.
For example, the genocide count has been separated into two counts -- one for the crimes Karadzic allegedly committed in Bosnia in 1992 and another one for his alleged role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Charges against Karadzic for complicity in genocide have been dropped.
The number of municipalities where crimes were allegedly committed fell from 41 to 27.
If approved by the tribunal, the new indictment is expected to speed up the trial.

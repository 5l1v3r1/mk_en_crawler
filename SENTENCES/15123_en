LONDON, United Kingdom -- Britain appears set to place restrictions on migration from Bulgaria and Romania by making employment of the two countries' nationals subject to work permits, local media reported on Wednesday (30 August). 
Newspapers quoted unnamed cabinet sources that said only workers with skills for which there is a shortage in Britain will be allowed to get jobs. 
British experts expect that 80,000 Bulgarians and 200,000 Romanians could move to Britain after the two countries join the EU on 1 January. 
British business organisations are divided over the issue.

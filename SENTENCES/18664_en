NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot government ordered the demolition of a key Green Line concrete barrier that has divided the island's capital Nicosia for decades Thursday (March 8th).
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said the move has been planned for 15 days.
He explained it is a goodwill gesture towards Turkish Cypriots, and urged Turkey to remove its troops so that passage could be truly opened.
Turkey has about 35,000 troops in the north.
The Green Line barrier is the main symbol of the decades-long division of the island, which is split between the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north, recognised only by Turkey.

TIRANA. 
Albania -- Sali Berisha, leader of the major opposition Democratic Party, said Wednesday (26 November) that the constitution is being violated. 
"The constitution . 
is not anymore a fundamental law of the rule of law and free society but a document violated by governance," Berisha said at a news conference on the fifth anniversary of its adoption. 
Noting the government continues to operate without two cabinet ministers, he charged that the president, government and parliament are not doing anything to resolve this "unconstitutional situation".

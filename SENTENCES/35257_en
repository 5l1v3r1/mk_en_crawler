WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States has made no requests to the Turkish authorities for increased access to Turkish military bases, US Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Lincoln Bloomfield said Friday (18 June). 
The issue was the subject of talks in Washington between Bloomfield, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal and Deputy Chief of the Turkish General Staff General Ilker Basbug.
In other news, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday, upon his return from Brussels, that he is disappointed with the contents of a EU draft report on Turkey's achievements in meeting EU membership criteria. 
However, he reiterated the hope that the EU will start accession negotiations with Turkey in March 2005.
Also Friday, four small bombs exploded in Istanbul and Izmir, slightly injuring three people. 
According to police, the devices were meant to create panic rather than cause any damage. 
Meanwhile, authorities said they have arrested four individuals suspected of involvement in a terrorist group with links to al-Qaeda.

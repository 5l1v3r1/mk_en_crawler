ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Parliament decided Thursday (11 March) to set up joint parliamentary committees on relations with Croatia and Macedonia. 
This is part of a new resolution reorganising the parliament's committees and delegations. 
Until now, there has been one delegation to Southeast Europe, in charge of relations with Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro and Albania. 
That delegation will continue to handle relations with the latter three countries.

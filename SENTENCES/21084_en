SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev says the government will maintain financial stability despite a strong surge in inflation and a widening current account deficit. 
Presenting a report Friday (August 31st) on his centre-left government's first two years in office, he said Bulgaria's financial stability is ensured by a solid budget surplus, small external debt, and strong economic growth.
The 2006 budget surplus was 3.6% of GDP, while foreign debt has dropped from 22.8% of GDP at the end of 2006 to 19.5% last month. 
Foreign investment rose by 20% in 2006 to a record 4.105 billion euros. 
The government expects an even higher figure for 2007, the prime minister said. 
Inflation, largely tame in recent months, surged to an annual rate of 8.4% in July.

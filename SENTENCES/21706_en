NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a report Tuesday (November 25th) on reconfiguring the international presence in Kosovo, claiming that due to the significant changes in the political situation, efforts to reconfigure UNMIK should continue. 
The document points out that Kosovo's new constitution has extended the powers of local authorities and new institutions have arisen, thereby creating significant challenges for UNMIK. 
In response, he said, the mission needs a reworking in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. 
Ban added that the reconfiguration will maintain the UN's neutral position on the Kosovo issue. 
He noted that the EU-led mission in Kosovo, EULEX, will observe Resolution 1244 and will work under the overall authority and within the status-neutral framework of the UN. 
The UN Security Council will discuss the report Wednesday.
In other news, the OSCE mission in Kosovo launched a two-week campaign against human trafficking Tuesday, calling on all to assist institutions in fighting the phenomenon. 
Recent years have seen an increase in the number of young Kosovo women who have become victims of human trafficking.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new poll by GfK Croatia suggests public support for NATO membership is growing.
According to results published on Monday (May 21st), 52% of the public backs Croatia's entry in the Pact, which is up some 9 percentage points from March.
Pollsters credit the government's effort to provide more information on Croatia's tasks and benefits, once it becomes a member of the Alliance.
In other news, a disaster response exercise run by the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Co-ordination Centre continues in coastal Zadar county.
The drill involves 1,000 participants from 44 members of NATO and the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme.

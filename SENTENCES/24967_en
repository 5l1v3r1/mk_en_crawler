BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Miroslav Lajcak, who resigned last week to become Slovakia's new foreign minister, is likely be succeeded by Italian diplomat Renzo Daviddi, Beta news agency reported on Saturday (January 31st), citing EU sources.
Daviddi has served as deputy chief of the European Commission Delegation in BiH, and currently heads the EU Liaison Office in Pristina.
Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz reported other Italians are in the running, including former Prime Minister Giuliano Amato and current Italian Ambassador to Kosovo Michael Giffoni.
One issue, however, is that Italy already commands both the EU peacekeeping mission in BiH, EUFOR, and the NATO general headquarters in Sarajevo.
Other possible candidates are Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian and former Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel.

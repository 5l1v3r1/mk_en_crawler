BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- As widely expected, an initiative by the opposition Serbian Radical Party for a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's cabinet failed Tuesday (24 May) in parliament.
The ruling coalition was backed by 126 out of 246 deputies present.
In arguing against the motion, the government stressed recent positive developments, especially the favourable EU feasibility study.
In Montenegro, meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights found that around 40.5 per cent of Montenegrins would likely vote for independence in a future referendum, compared to 36 per cent who oppose it.
The results of the poll were released Tuesday.
Also Tuesday, top representatives of Serbia and Serbia-Montenegro agreed on the principles of a joint platform for Kosovo that will be presented during Friday's UN Security Council meeting in New York.
Both Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated their readiness to meet with their Kosovo counterparts.

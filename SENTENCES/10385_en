SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Reforms in Macedonia's judicial sector are set to begin at the end of the year or early in 2005, according to the chairman of the state anti-corruption commission, Jovan Trpenovski. 
In a statement Saturday (18 September), he said the restructuring would be aimed primarily at increasing the transparency and efficiency of the local judiciary, as well as of legal procedures. 
Reforming the judicial sector has been one of the main conditions raised by Brussels in the EU integration process.

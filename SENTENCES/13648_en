BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The main suspect in the landmark trial of five former members of a Serb paramilitary unit known as the Scorpions expressed no remorse for murders allegedly committed by his troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Slobodan Medic insisted that he had not ordered the videotaped killing of six Muslims but justified the soldiers' action by claiming that their own relatives had suffered repression. 
Medic also said that he would have killed the Serb soldier who taped the execution if he had known that the film would become public one day. 
If convicted, the five defendants could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison.

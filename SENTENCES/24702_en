THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Judges at the UN war crimes tribunal increased former Former Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer Veselin Sljivancanin's jail sentence Tuesday (May 5th), extending it from five years to 17.
Delivering a final verdict in the case, the judges ruled the original sentence was inadequate.
Sljivancanin, who had been released in December 2007, returned to the Hague for the ruling and is now back in jail.
His superior, Mile Mrksic, had his 20-year sentence upheld by the court on Tuesday.
Both cases stem, from the mass murder of Croatian prisoners of war following the capture of Vukovar in November 1991.
Tuesday's verdicts follow an appeals proceeding.
On Monday, indictees Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic returned to The Hague tribunal's Scheveningen detention centre after the tribunal ordered the resumption of their war crimes trial.
The proceedings involving Stanisic, a former Serb security chief, and his deputy, Simatovic, began in April 2007, but were halted a year ago due to Stanisic's health issues.
Doctors recently declared him healthy enough to participate in his own defence, prompting judges to announce the trial will resume on May 25th.
Stanisic and Simatovic face charges of training, arming and directing paramilitary units that killed and persecuted non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Balkan conflicts.(Beta, B92, Tanjug - 04/05/09)

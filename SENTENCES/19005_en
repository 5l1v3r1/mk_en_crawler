BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Representatives of the US-Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- gathered in Brussels on Sunday (December 3rd) to discuss the results of last week's NATO summit in Riga. 
Daniel Fried, US assistant secretary of state, urged his fellow diplomats to work for reforms and meet set standards, so the prospect of invitations to join NATO in 2008 becomes a reality. 
Representatives from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia were also on hand.
Fried described the Alliance's decision to invite them to join the Partnership for Peace programme as a sign that the Alliance trusts the democratic forces in these states to do what is necessary for full integration in NATO and the EU. 
He urged Serbia to find the courage to arrest Ratko Mladic and other war crimes fugitives.

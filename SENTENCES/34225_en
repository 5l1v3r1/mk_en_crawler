PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner signed two new decrees Sunday (6 July), establishing a new Criminal Code and a new Criminal Procedure Code.
"We have one of the most modern laws now ...
it makes combating crime more efficient and brings Kosovo's legal system in line with international law standards," he said at a press briefing.
The new laws incorporate legislation on terrorism, organised crime, and police surveillance of suspects.
The legislation will take effect in nine months.
Steiner leaves his post on Monday after 18 months on the job.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, leader of the National Liberal Party, rejected a new call Monday (December 11th) for early elections from the Democratic Party (PD). 
Earlier in the day, PD leader Emil Boc suggested that Tariceanu submit his resignation to clear the way for an early vote. 
But Tariceanu said the country must focus instead on imminent EU entry issues and the post-accession period. 
He acknowledged however that elections might be necessary if the coalition cabinet loses its majority in parliament. 
Last week, the small Conservative Party quit the government, saying its legislative initiatives were constantly rejected.

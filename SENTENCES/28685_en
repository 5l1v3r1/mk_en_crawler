BUCHAREST, Romania -- Transport Minister Radu Berceanu survived a no confidence motion Monday (April 12th), with 65 senators backing him and 47 in opposition. 
The opposition Social Democratic Party initiated the effort, arguing that the transport ministry has recently allowed too many irregularities. 
The cabinet recently adopted new legislation to combat non-licensed transport and shipping companies. 
Berceanu is also criticised for the poor condition of the country's transportation infrastructure. 
This is the latest in a series of failed attempts to bring down various cabinet members. 
Previous targets were Education Minister Daniel Funeriu, Labour Minister Mihai Seitan and Healthcare Minister Cseke Attila.

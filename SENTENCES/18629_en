BERLIN, Germany -- Germany and the European Commission (EC) will work hard to persuade Libya to release five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who were sentenced to death in Tripoli in a controversial HIV infection case, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday (January 9th). 
Germany took over the EU's rotating presidency at the start of the year. 
At a press conference with EC President Jose Manual Barroso, Merkel promised to exert maximum pressure on Libya to set the nurses free.
For his part, Barroso described the death sentences as "completely unfair" and expressed hope that the Libyan authorities "will understand how important this is for their co-operation with Europe".
Also on Tuesday, Bulgaria sent a letter to European Parliament (EP) President Josep Borrell, asking that the issue be included in the agenda of the EP's first session of the year, later this month. 
Meanwhile, the Muslim community in Plovdiv issued a statement in support of the medics. 
It will be delivered to the Libyan embassy in Sofia.

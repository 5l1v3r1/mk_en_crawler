DAVOS, Switzerland -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday (24 January) asked UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to appoint a mediator from a neutral country for talks on the reunification of Cyprus. 
Erdogan also indicated that Turkey would back the UN plan for the island. 
This followed a meeting Friday of Turkey's National Security Council, comprised of civilian and military leaders. 
Annan told reporters that he was encouraged by Turkey's willingness to contribute to solving the problem before Cyprus becomes a member of the EU on 1 May. 
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, meanwhile, phoned his Greek counterpart George Papandreou, to ask him for assistance in persuading Greek Cypriots to be more flexible on the issue of reunification. 
Erdogan is due to meet with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in Ankara on Monday and with US President George W. 
Bush on Wednesday. 
Turkey fears the Cyprus issue will damage its own chances for eventual EU membership.

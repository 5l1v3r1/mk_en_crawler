PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN police reportedly have stepped up security measures around Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's residence, following recent outbreaks of violence in the province and an unsuccessful attempt on the president's life last month.
Reuters reported on Thursday (21 April) that police are only allowing residents to enter Rugova's neighbourhood.
Tensions in Kosovo rose after the resignation of Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj and the recent killing of his younger brother.

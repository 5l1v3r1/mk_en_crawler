TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Sunday (September 5th) he is disappointed with parliament's performance this year.
He told lawmakers that consensus is the only way to implement crucial reforms.
In a public address, Topi said no law that requires a qualified majority has been passed during this period.
"The role of the parliament and the contribution of those elected is not measured by the quickness of adopting the laws or their number, but rather by the way they are adopted and their quality to serve the citizens for a European future," Topi said.
He reminded parliament members that consensus is needed in terms of electoral reform, to guarantee the voting process in the autumn 2011 elections.

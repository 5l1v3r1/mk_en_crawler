TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who leads the ruling Democratic Party (DP), rejected on Tuesday (11 July) the possibility of early parliamentary elections, recently hinted at by the opposition. 
Speaking at a meeting of the DP parliamentary caucus, Berisha also dismissed the opposition's suggestions that the election of a new president, after incumbent Alfred Moisiu's term expires next year, would fail. 
The opposition says if it does not negotiate with the current majority, there could be no consensus candidate for president.
The five opposition parties in parliament plan a rally Wednesday evening in Tirana to protest policies of the DP government.

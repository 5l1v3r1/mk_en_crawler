ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday (27 April) that bilateral ties with Armenia could not be normalised if it continues its campaign to have WWI massacres described as genocide.
Saying Turkey has already opened its archives to historians and experts, he called on Armenia to do the same.
The neighbouring country is seeking international recognition of the killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks.
Recently, Armenian President Robert Kocharian responded to a Turkish proposal to establish a joint committee to look into the issue, saying that bilateral relations must first be normalised unconditionally.
Also Wednesday, Turkish police found a time bomb under a bridge in Istanbul.
Officials say it was similar to one discovered earlier in the day in the depot of a local transport company.

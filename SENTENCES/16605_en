PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum, Miroslav Lajcak, says new negotiations between Serbia and Montenegro might be held if the 21 May poll shows a majority in favour of independence, but falls short of the required threshold.
Under the referendum rules, 55 per cent of participating voters must back independence for the bid to succeed.
If results fall in the "grey zone", the need for talks on the future of the state union would be obvious, Lajcak suggested.

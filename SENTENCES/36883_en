SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Ambassadors from EU member states issued a joint statement Wednesday (7 July), welcoming the formation of the Commission for Police Reforms in BiH.
The diplomats stressed that police reform was a key requirement of the European Commission's feasibility study for the country.
Most importantly, they said, the public deserves "police forces that will work in their best interest by combating crime, including organised crime and corruption".
In other news Wednesday, Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic rejected the possibility of calling early elections in the entity, in a statement broadcast on RS public TV.
The junior government partner, the Party for Democratic Progress, sought elections following the sacking of 60 Bosnian Serb officials last week by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
Also Wednesday, the chairman of the RS commission investigating the 1995 Srebrenica massacre says the panel may miss the 15 July deadline for compiling a list of missing persons.
Milan Bogdanic says his panel will ask the government to transfer that task to another relevant institution.

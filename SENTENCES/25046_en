SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The parliament of Republika Srpska (RS) meets in special session Monday (December 28th) to discuss High Representative Valentin Inzko's decision to extend the mandates of foreign judges and prosecutors working in BiH's courts. 
Foreign judges and prosecutors will continue to work only on war crimes cases until 2012, while those in charge of corruption, organised crime and terrorism will become advisers to domestic personnel. 
The RS government rejects Inzko's move under his Bonn Powers as unacceptable and has warned it may ask parliament to approve a referendum on the issue.

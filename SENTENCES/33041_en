BUCHAREST, Romania -- US European Command will again use Romania's Constanta seaport to transport troops, equipment and materials to KFOR personnel, Maj Jesse DGalvan, commander of the US military camp at Constanta, announced Saturday (21 June). 
Galvan said 50 troops arrived at the camp earlier this month, while other would arrive in the next two weeks. 
The decision to use Constanta for a second time was based on last summer's positive experience, said Galvan. 
Romanian police would again help US soldiers guard the area.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Ombudsman Sasa Jankovic will decide within the next couple of weeks whether to bring the controversial new law on information before the Constitutional Court, local media reported on Thursday (September 3rd). 
He explained that his duty is to protect citizens' rights, including the right to objective information. 
Parliament approved the measure on Monday. 
It tightens libel penalties and would impose draconian fines -- even confiscation of advertising revenue -- for media companies that violate the law. 
Media organisations have widely criticised the measure.

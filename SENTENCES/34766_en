BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Authorities announced on Tuesday (12 August) that they have completed the judicial investigation into the March assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Vucko Mircic, the magistrate in charge of the investigation, told reporters that enough evidence has been collected to launch criminal proceedings against the suspects. 
The exact number of those who will face charges is unclear. 
Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said the first trials are expected in September or October. 
Analysts say the proceedings would be viewed as a test of the Serbian government and the law enforcement system.

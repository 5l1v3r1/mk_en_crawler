LONDON, Great Britain -- Ministers and security chiefs from 30 countries met Monday (25 November) in London for an EU-led international conference on organised crime in Southeast Europe.
The region has become organised crime's gateway to Europe, said Britain's Home Secretary, David Blunkett.
EU officials added that such crime is undermining Union efforts and threatening the political and economic stability of countries in the region.
In a concluding statement, the participants agreed on measures aimed at stemming activities by Balkan gangs.
They pledged to set up a regional centre in 2003 that will co-ordinate efforts to combat trans-border crime, tighten security at airports and at sea, train police in Balkan countries and promote legislation against money laundering.
They also pledged to fight trafficking.
EU security chief Javier Solana estimates that as many as 200,000 women are smuggled through or to the Balkans every year as part of the global sex trade managed by criminal groups.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The chief prosecutor's spokeswoman, Martina Mihordin, confirmed on Tuesday (2 May) that her office has demanded the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Branimir Glavas.
Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks says prosecutors asked him to approve a criminal procedure against the MP, who is reportedly under investigation for crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991.

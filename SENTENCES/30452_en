BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet survived a no-confidence motion Wednesday (March 16th), as the opposition fell 24 votes short of the 236 it needed to oust the government.
At issue was the new labour code recently adopted by the cabinet via an emergency procedure, through which a bill is adopted without parliamentary debate or votes.
Wednesday's vote means that the cabinet survives and the new labour code moves closer to adoption.
The final step is for the president to promulgate the bill, expected within weeks.
While lawmakers debated the motion, about 8,000 people gathered outside parliament demanding the government's resignation.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- According to media reports Wednesday (December 24th), Romania will maintain troops in Iraq in 2009, following approval of an agreement by the Iraqi parliament. 
Baghdad had asked Romania to maintain its troops until July 2009, and the Romanian parliament has approved the request. 
The previous agreement was to expire on January 1st.
In other news Tuesday, new Romanian Transport Minister Radu Berceanu said he plans to dismiss all 24 managers of the ministry's departments and subordinate agencies due to their high salaries. 
The decision will save the state up to 350,000 euros per month, Berceanu said.
Also Tuesday, prosecutors indicted former Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru on corruption charges. 
A presidential decree in September suspended him for alleged involvement in corruption schemes. 
According to the indictment, his son's company won a contract with a state-owned company in return for Pacuraru keeping one of the heads of the Gorj Labour Inspectorate at his post.

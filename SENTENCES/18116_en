SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The owner of one of Bulgaria's top league soccer clubs has been shot dead. 
The body of Alexander Tassev, 45, was found in his Mercedes on Monday (May 14th)I in a suburb of the capital. 
He acquired Lokomotiv Plovdiv in 2006 several months after the club's previous owner Georgi Iliev was killed in his own bar in the Black Sea resort of Sunny Beach. 
Iliev was considered one of Bulgaria's top underworld figures during the 1990s. 
His predecessor was assassinated in Sofia in 2005. 
The EU repeatedly has criticised the Bulgarian government for failing to deal with organised crime.

ANKARA, Turkey -- At least four people died and several houses were destroyed in landslides in northeast Turkey on Saturday (November 21st) and Sunday caused by heavy rainfall and snow blizzards.
Two of the victims were smashed by a big rock that fell on their home in the region of the Black Sea port of Trabzon.
The other two victims were in the town of Yaglidere in the northern province of Giresun.
Some 18 people, including university students, who spent more than a day stuck in a van on a road in the Rize province, were rescued on Sunday.
Authorities said they got into trouble because they used a road that was banned during the winter.

OHRID, Macedonia -- The prime ministers of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Albania are scheduled to meet in Ohrid on Thursday (22 May) to discuss measures for improving border controls. 
The meeting is being organised by Macedonia, NATO and the Balkans Stability Pact, and will be held under the auspices of NATO Secretary General George Robertson. 
NATO said in a statement that the focus of the conference will be "drug smuggling, gun running, human trafficking, and political violence," which are destabilising the region.

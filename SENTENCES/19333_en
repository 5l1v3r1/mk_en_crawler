ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion against the government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis early Saturday (March 29th). 
It was filed by the main opposition party PASOK, which demanded the government step down over the controversial pension reform law that has provoked widespread strikes across Greece. 
Karamanlis stood firm before the vote saying, "We do not play games with the future of our society. 
We do not capitulate in front of problems." (ANA-MPA, Focus - 29/03/08)

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government will ask The Hague tribunal to allow Serbs convicted of war crimes to serve their sentences in Serbian prisons, Rasim Ljajic, head of the tribunal co-operation council, told RTS late on Monday (March 16th).
He added the issue would undergo discussion during chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz's visit to Belgrade next week.
Ljajic also said the government had new information about the whereabouts of fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, insisting that police would arrest the pair this year.
Separately, Sasa Vukadinovic, director of the Security and Information Agency (BIA), said on Tuesday the arrests would be the BIA's priority in 2009.
Mladic's arrest is the main condition for implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement Serbia signed with the EU nearly a year ago.

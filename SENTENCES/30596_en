NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu met on Wednesday (January 12th) to discuss governance and power-sharing as part of ongoing talks to reunify the island. 
"Both sides put forward some proposals, and both sides want to go away and consider the proposals," UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser Alexander Downer said after the meeting. 
The two leaders will meet once again next week before meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Geneva on January 26th.

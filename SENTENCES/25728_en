ATHENS, Greece -- Customs officials returned to their jobs Sunday (February 21st) after a six-day strike against the government's austerity plan that would freeze their wages and cut bonuses. 
The strike was supposed to continue through Wednesday when a nationwide strike has been announced but a court ruled it illegal on Saturday. 
The strike caused fuel supply problems across the country.

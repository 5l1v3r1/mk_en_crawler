BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) said on Wednesday (May 2nd) that the future Serbian government holds the "key" to relaunching negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The statement, quoted by the Beta news agency, coincided with the first anniversary of the EU's suspension of the SAA talks with Belgrade over its failure to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
The EC also urged politicians to form a new cabinet as soon as possible, now that three months have passed since elections.

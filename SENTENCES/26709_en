SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko arrived on Monday (December 7th) in Mostar for talks with local politicians about the longstanding stalemate in the town. 
Mostar has been without a mayor and without a budget for more than a year because of disagreements among City Council members on a consensus candidate. 
Inzko has warned that he will intervene if local leaders fail to reach a compromise.

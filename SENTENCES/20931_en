ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, leader of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), denied on Monday (February 4th) recent reports suggesting that talks with the EU are blocked over the recent introduction of a protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic. 
At a meeting with fellow HDZ party members, Sanader said Croatia is proceeding towards EU membership "in fifth gear" despite the fact that "a country" has been unofficially blocking certain chapters of Croatia's talks since 2006. 
That "country" is neighbouring Slovenia, which adamantly opposes the ZERP.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The commander of the 1,500 US troops in Kosovo said on Wednesday (January 17th) that he does not anticipate outbreaks of violence when UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari unveils his plan for the province.
"There's been a lot of personal investment by citizens in this province and all that investment will be lost if folks just turn to violence", Brigadier General Douglas Earhart explained.
He added that some level of tension can be expected, as people are bound to be happy with parts of Ahtisaari's plan and unhappy with others.
Meanwhile, UNMIK and KFOR both stated Wednesday that they have no information about the existence of paramilitary forces in Kosovo.
They were commenting on recent allegations that Serb extremist elements were functioning in northern Kosovo, posing a risk of destabilisation after Ahtisaari unveils his proposal.
A senior Kosovo Serb politician, Oliver Ivanovic also denied on Wednesday the existence of such paramilitary groups.
Also on Wednesday, the interim government in Kosovo said the implementation of internationally set standards is proceeding as scheduled.
The cabinet also adopted a plan for European integration and partnership, with concrete tasks assigned to the various ministries and departments.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Last year's political accord regarding BiH police sector restructuring must be fully implemented and any renegotiation is out of the question, EU security chief Javier Solana told the daily Dnevni avaz in an interview published Thursday.
Noting that talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU began after the police sector agreement was sealed, Solana said the Union expects BiH politicians to keep their word and fully support the BiH Police Reform Directorate, the panel established to craft changes to the country's police system.
The Directorate's work has been thwarted repeatedly by Republika Srpska, whose representatives reject the idea of police structures crossing inter-entity lines.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Democratic Party's (DP) Secretary General, Ridvan Bode, announced on Wednesday (27 July) that the DP is ready to propose a right-wing coalition cabinet led by DP leader Sali Berisha. 
Bode refused to elaborate, however, saying that details would be presented to the public as soon as President Alfred Moisiu officially decides to give Berisha a mandate. 
Bode indicated DP expects no significant change in overall results because of revotes ordered in two constituencies. 
DP won the original 3 July elections.

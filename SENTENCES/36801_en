TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Thursday (15 July) adopted a law regarding individuals who have been politically persecuted.
The measure passed in the second round by a vote of 70-2 and 1 abstention.
Parliament Speaker Servet Pellumbi ruled that the 1 July first round was invalid.
The law would provide financial compensation to all those persecuted for political reasons.
Survivors of those executed would be compensated as well.
The measure was adopted by the ruling Socialist Party, as the major opposition Democratic Party had left the chamber.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana survived a no confidence vote within his own party Friday (December 18th).
The vote followed Geoana's loss in the presidential elections by a narrow 0.75% to Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) candidate Traian Basescu, who won a second term.
In addition, four members with seats in parliament left the PSD this month, which could lead to approval of the PDL-Democratic Alliance of Hungarians cabinet, making the PSD an opposition party.
Despite this, party leaders were nearly unanimous in their support of Geoana, with only one vote cast against him.

TIRANA, Albania -- The political environment in Albania is polarised and characterised by fierce rhetoric combined with personal attacks from politicians, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said in a report quoted by local media Wednesday (March 9th). 
The rhetoric stems from the disputed 2009 general elections and corruption, the document said. 
It noted the fact that the Central Election Commission is politically divided, while the opposition has boycotted its work.
On Wednesday, the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) said it will request the formation of a panel to investigate the work of parliament, based on the 2010 progress report by the European Commission that, in part, criticised that work and the manner in which Speaker Jozefina Topalli led parliament.
Also Wednesday, ruling Democratic Party representatives in parliament announced plans to establish a committee to investigate SP leader Edi Rama's assets, after he declared only 3,000 euros in personal wealth. 
The DP has insisted that Rama has abused his power as Tirana mayor for personal gain.

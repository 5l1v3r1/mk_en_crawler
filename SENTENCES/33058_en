BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Banja Luka on Sunday (22 June) for his second pastoral visit to BiH. 
Bishops and top state officials, led by the chairman of the three-member presidency Borislav Paravac and High Representative Paddy Ashdown, welcomed the pope, thanking him for his efforts to promote religious and cultural tolerance. 
But Serbian Orthodox Church Patriarch Pavle has refused to meet with the pope. 
As in some other Orthodox churches in the region, the Serbian clerics are refusing to heal a rift that has divided their church from the Catholics since the 14th century. 
The Pope's first visit to BiH was in 1997.

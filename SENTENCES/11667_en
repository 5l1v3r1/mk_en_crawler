BERLIN, Germany -- Two senior German officials have urged the Turkish government to speed up reforms if it wants to start accession talks with the Union in October. 
In an interview published Sunday (20 March), Guenter Gloser, a spokesman for the ruling Social Democrats, said Turkey was currently in "a weak phase of fatigue" after carrying out a spate of democratic reforms last year. 
Martin Schulz, leader of the Socialist faction in the European Parliament, lamented what he described as the lack of progress in 2005. 
Earlier in March, Hansjorg Kretschmer, the EU envoy to Ankara, warned of "a slippage" in the Turkish government's reform drive.

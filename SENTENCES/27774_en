ANKARA, Turkey -- VS Naipaul, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Literature, has pulled out of a literary event in Istanbul amid protests against his views of Islam. 
Organisers of the European Writers' Parliament, due to start Thursday (November 25th), said on Wednesday that his decision came amid the broad "politicising" of his participation by the media. 
The conference is taking place as part of events to mark Istanbul as the 2010 European Capital of Culture. 
Naipaul, a Trinidadian writer of Indian descent currently living in Great Britain, has two books on Islam -- Among the Believers and Beyond Belief.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic voiced satisfaction Tuesday (October 13th) with ongoing talks about visa liberalisation.
A European Commission (EC) expert mission arrived in Belgrade on Monday and will stay until Friday to assess Serbia's progress in meeting the criteria required for visa-free travel to EU member countries.
The experts will submit a report to the EC, which in turn will decide the matter in mid-November and forward it to the interior ministers of EU countries.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia and Kosovo posted a triangular sign on Monday (June 30th) to mark the formal start of demarking their 150km-long bilateral border.
Macedonia's northern border with Kosovo has never been officially delineated since the former Yugoslav republic gained independence in 1991.
Macedonia and Kosovo formed a joint committee on the issue in March, shortly after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia.
The demarcation continues over the summer, with the pace depending on weather conditions in the mountainous terrain, Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vasko Andonovski said.
He added that workmen delineated 12km on Monday.
In other news Monday, Pieter Feith, head of the International Civilian Office in Kosovo, stressed the importance of the EU police and judicial mission -- EULEX -- deploying across all of Kosovo.
Feith, who held a joint news conference with President Fatmir Sejdiu after a meeting of the International Steering Group for Kosovo, said he hopes EULEX will deploy quickly in the Serb-dominated north but declined to give a time frame.
He also reiterated that as far as the international community is concerned, the newly established Serb parliament in northern Kosovo has "no legal effect".
Meanwhile, a new poll by the OSCE finds that that KFOR is the most trusted institution in Kosovo, followed by the Kosovo Police Corps.
Respondents expressed the most distrust in the judiciary.
Pollsters conducted the survey late last year, before Kosovo declared independence.

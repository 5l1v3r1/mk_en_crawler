ATHENS, Greece -- Military experts on Tuesday (September 28th) searched a German-flagged cargo ship at the Piraeus port suspected of transporting materials used in building weapons. 
The search was conducted after receiving a tip that the vessel was carrying ballistic missiles and weapons. 
Defence ministry sources say the inspection determined that the materials discovered onboard could have dual use. 
The ship is reportedly French-owned and was coming from Asia to Syria. 
Reports suggest its cargo might be North Korean.

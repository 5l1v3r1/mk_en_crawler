Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci is asking Kosovo Serbs to cast their ballots in the November elections.
According to Kuci, if Kosovo Serbs back decentralisation, they need to vote.
"Serbs should participate in the elections, because we are not interested in having municipalities under the control of parallel structures, and we are looking for the decentralisation of Kosovo," Kuci said on Monday (July 27th).
He is optimistic that the minority group will turn out.
Belgrade, however, is pushing to boycott the election, as former envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, which Serbia rejects, will be used as a blueprint.
"Serbs are still not legally protected and do not have an adequate number of local self-governments that we have been striving for in the process of decentralisation," Serb Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic told Belgrade-based B92.
Bogdanovic noted that decentralisation is a key step, and said Belgrade would back an election organised by a status-neutral organisation "rather than under the patronage of [EU Special Representative in Kosovo] Pieter Feith's office or the government of Kosovo".
The Serb minister described the Council of Europe, the EU, the UN, and UNMIK as "status-neutral sponsors" and said Serbia is ready to jumpstart talks that will help decentralise Kosovo, but not jeopardise Serbia's position, according to B92.
"We are also ready to talk with EULEX, regardless of the fact it demonstrated bias on numerous occasions," said Bogdanovic.
"There are many issues that we must solve quickly.
We want to solve the legal vacuum in the north of Kosovo as soon as possible, but, of course, not at the expense of the Serb community, not to work according to the laws of the so-called state of Kosovo and not to promote the Ahtisaari plan."

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The constituent session of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) House of Peoples (HoP) is scheduled for Thursday (January 25th).
At the end of last week, the BiH Central Election Commission confirmed the mandates of deputies to the FBiH HoP, elected by cantons in the entity.
But Izmir Hadziavdic, the secretary of the FBiH Parliament's upper house, warned that the parties represented in the HoP have not submitted their proposals for a speaker and the two deputy speakers.
That in turn further delays the naming of an FBiH president and vice presidents.
The situation is similar in the FBiH House of Representatives.
It held its constituent session in November, but the parties have yet to agree on the leadership.

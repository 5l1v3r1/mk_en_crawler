BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen on Thursday (25 March). 
They discussed Turkey's EU accession prospects and the measures that must be taken before a date on launching accession negotiations can be assigned at the end of this year. 
At a joint press conference afterwards, Verheugen said that the European Commission is optimistic about prospects for starting negotiations. 
However, he added, Turkey still needs to completely fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria.

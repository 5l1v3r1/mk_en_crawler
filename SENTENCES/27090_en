ATHENS, Greece -- The leader of the main opposition PASOK party, George Papandreou, demanded early parliamentary elections Sunday (August 2nd) due to the economic crisis and the "difficult" state of public finance. 
"The country is in a total deadlock and citizens want a new beginning," Papandreou said in an interview with Real News. 
"In many countries, big crises have led to deep public changes," Papandreou said, comparing the current situation to the 1930s Great Depression in the United States. 
He noted Greece is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in September 2011. 
Presidential elections are earlier, in March 2010. 
If lawmakers do not approve the new president, early parliamentary elections must be held.

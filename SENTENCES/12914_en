THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Retired Bosnian Serb generals Milan Gvero and Radivoje Miletic were expected to appear for the first time before the UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (2 March).
The two generals -- former deputy commanders of the Bosnian Serb army -- surrendered to the tribunal after their formal indictments late last month.
The third general reportedly named in the same indictment, former Bosnian Serb military intelligence chief General Zdravko Tolimir, has not yet agreed to surrender.
The tribunal also announced that the first hearing in the trial against former Bosnian Muslim military commander Rasim Delic is scheduled for Thursday.
He turned himself in late last month.

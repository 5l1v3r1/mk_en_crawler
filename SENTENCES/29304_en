TIRANA, Albania -- Prosecutors in the southern town of Vlora seized the property of Albino Prudentino, one of the top mafia bosses in southern Italy, on Monday (October 4th). 
Acting on instructions from across the Adriatic, authorities seized the Artur resort, just outside Tirana, and a restaurant in Vlora. 
Prudentino was arrested there last week in a joint crack down on organised crime, with Italian authorities. 
Last month, a court in the southern Italian town of Lecce issued a warrant on charges of criminal mafia-style collaboration, drug trafficking and kidnapping. 
Albanian police said seven other members of the Sacra Corona Unita mafia organisation were also arrested. 
Prudentino allegedly established a base in Vlora, renting two shops and a casino as a cover. 
His property was seized based on Albania's anti-mafia law. 
Investigators are looking at companies in which shareholders include relatives of Albanian government officials.

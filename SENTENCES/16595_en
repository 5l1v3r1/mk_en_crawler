BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian students' union and the National Education Federation asked the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives (CNSAS) on Monday (7 August) to examine the files of university deans and rectors for possible collaboration with the country's Communist-era security services.
They submitted a list of 56 top officials from state universities.
While students say their aim is to rid the system of the former Securitate collaborators, the National Council of Deans dismissed the move as a publicity stunt.
Meanwhile, the CNSAS has been checking the files of 29 politicians for links to Securitate.
Senator Razvan Theodorescu of the Social Democratic Party has been cleared of any connection and is now threatening to sue a local newspaper, Romania Libera, which suggested he had been a collaborator.
The CNSAS on Monday upheld an earlier ruling that Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu was involved in political policing for Securitate.

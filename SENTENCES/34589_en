SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The defence ministry reported on Friday (29 August) that Bulgarian troops had come under fire from a grenade launcher in Iraq earlier in the day. 
No one was injured in the incident and there was no damage. 
Bulgaria sent a battalion of 500 servicemen to the Iraqi holy city of Karbala, assuming control of the town from the US Marines earlier in the week. 
This was the first major attack against the Bulgarians since their arrival.
In other news, Spanish Foreign Minister Ana de Palacio arrives on a two-day official visit to Bulgaria on Sunday, at the invitation of Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy. 
The two ministers are to discuss Bulgaria's progress in EU integration, entry into NATO and joint efforts to rebuild post-war Iraq.

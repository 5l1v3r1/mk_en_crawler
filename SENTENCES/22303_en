BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops on Friday (April 11th) raided the home of war crimes indictee Stojan Zupljanin, searching for fresh evidence of contacts between the fugitive and his family in Banja Luka. 
Zupljanin's wife and son said such raids are "agonising" for the family and they appealed to him to surrender. 
Zupljanin, a former head of the Republika Srspska police, has been on the run since 1999, when he was indicted by The Hague tribunal for war crimes and genocide during the 1992-1995 conflict.

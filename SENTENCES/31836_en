WASHINGTON, United States -- A new report by the State Department concludes that Croatia generally respects human rights but is still experiencing serious problems in some areas. 
Issued Monday (31 March), the survey found continuous progress in protection of human rights over the past 12 months. 
Areas of improvement included judicial reforms, trials against war crimes suspects, and relations with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague -- except for the case involving indicted retired Gen Janko Bobetko. 
Areas that came under criticism included political influence in courts, minority rights, property restitution and the incidence of violence in families.
In other news, the power supply companies in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) signed a co-operation agreement in Sarajevo on Tuesday. 
Croatia will import around 150m euros worth of electricity, in exchange for former investments made by Croatian entities in BiH.

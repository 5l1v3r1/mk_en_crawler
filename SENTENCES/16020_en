PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic said on Monday (18 September) that he plans this week to give Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic a mandate to form a new cabinet.
Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists-led coalition won the parliamentary elections earlier this month.
He has been hinting, however, that he may leave politics.

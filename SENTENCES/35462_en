SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a strongly worded statement on Thursday (15 April), Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, criticised Republika Srpska (RS) authorities for obstructing the work of a commission investigating the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
His statement came after the RS government said the commission's report would be delayed six months, until October. 
Local media are reporting that sanctions may be imposed on top officials in the entity.

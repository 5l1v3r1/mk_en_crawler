ANKARA, Turkey -- The government has approved a set of economic sanctions against groups that support the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), including a limit on specific export items. 
After a cabinet meeting Wednesday (October 31st), Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said "military, political, diplomatic, and economic measures" were being taken simultaneously.
The same day, commenting on Turkish warnings that it might launch a cross-border operation into northern Iraq, Russia called for restraint. 
In an interview with the Anadolu news agency, Kremlin deputy spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia understands Turkey's terror concerns. 
However, he added, Ankara must "acknowledge its responsibility as a regional power".
The Pentagon, meanwhile, has confirmed that it is helping Turkish security services deal with the PKK threat. 
"We have given them more and more intelligence as a result of the recent concerns," Defense Department Press Secretary Geoff Morrell told a press conference.

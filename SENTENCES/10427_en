BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Polls opened across Serbia at 7 am on Sunday (19 September) for local elections.
Citizens will vote for mayors and municipal councillors in 148 municipalities in the republic as well as for members of the Vojvodina regional assembly.
Opinion surveys conducted immediately before the vote showed Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia trailing in third or fourth place, with the pro-reform Democrats and the ultranationalist Radicals holding the first two spots.
The OSCE Mission to Serbia-Montenegro has provided financial support for the local Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID), which is monitoring the elections.
With OSCE's assistance, CESID has deployed 300 volunteers in 150 polling stations throughout Belgrade as well as 150 volunteers organised in 50 mobile teams in 17 municipalities in Vojvodina and Sandzak.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A two-day meeting on distributing the assets of the former Yugoslavia opened in Belgrade on Thursday (September 17th).
Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said representatives of former Yugoslav countries will discuss the return of property belonging to companies and citizens, tenant rights, pensions and old foreign currency savings.
He added that for the first time, debate will focus on all unresolved issues, rather than on a single one, as has been the case so far.
The last meeting was held two years ago in Slovenia.

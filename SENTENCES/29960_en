BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission called on Friday (May 20th) on the Albanian authorities to publish the results from Tirana mayoral elections. 
"There cannot be two different results for these elections, that is why the result must be announced without any further delay," Natasha Butler, spokesperson for EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said at a press conference. 
European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso who was scheduled to visit Tirana on Friday cancelled the visit due to the tensions surrounding the counting process.

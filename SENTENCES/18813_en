PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A total of 2,150 names remain on the list of Kosovo missing persons following the 1998-1999 interethnic conflict, according to a UNMIK statement Wednesday (December 6th). 
Some 5,206 people, including ethnic Albanians, Serbs and others, were initially registered as missing in the province. 
The latest data from the International Committee of the Red Cross suggests that, due to the efforts of the Office on Missing Persons and Forensics, this number has declined.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police announced on Wednesday (March 9th) the arrest of former deputy Foreign Minister Feim Chaushev on suspicions that he mediated a ransom for a stolen car. 
The vehicle, owned by a Turkish businessman, was stolen on February 19th from a hotel parking lot. 
The owner allegedly called Chaushev seeking assistance and was told he would get his car back in return for 25,000 euros. 
The Turkish national initially agreed but then called the police to alert them of Chaushev's offer. 
He served as member of the previous Bulgarian Socialist Party-led government between 2005 and 2008.

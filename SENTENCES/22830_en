PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Portugal's government announced on Tuesday (October 7th) it recognises Kosovo's independence.
"We are convinced that now the independence of Kosovo is irreversible," Foreign Minister Luis Amado told the Portuguese parliament's foreign committee.
The Iberian country is the 22nd EU member and 48th country globally to recognise Kosovo.
Separately, Montenegro may be wavering on whether to recognise Kosovo, which would boost Pristina's membership bids in NATO and the EU.
Earlier reports implied it was close to recognising the fledgling country, but the AP reported Wednesday Montenegro "says it will support Serbia's bid to question [the] legality of Kosovo's independence" in an apparent effort "to ease tensions" with Belgrade.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Ali Babacan, wraps up a visit to Bulgaria and heads on to Romania on Wednesday (March 21st), seeking support for his country's EU bid from the Union's newest members. 
He met on Tuesday with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin, who assured him that the country stands behind Turkey when it comes to all EU-related political and economic reforms.
Separately Tuesday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a mildly worded statement noting that Turkish leaders had not been invited to celebrations in Berlin later this week to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. 
Germany, however, says none of the EU candidates were invited.
In other news, a delegation led by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul kicks off an official trip to Macedonia on Wednesday. 
Economic ties are expected to dominate the talks.

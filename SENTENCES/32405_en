ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Monday (24 March) that it had expelled a senior Iraqi diplomat, but would not heed a US request for the suspension of diplomatic ties with Baghdad. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Panos Beglitis told reporters that Iraq's deputy chief of mission was ordered to leave last week because he had engaged in activities incompatible with his diplomatic status. 
A Greek state-run news agency identified the diplomat as Arrak Abdullah.

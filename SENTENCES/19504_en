ANKARA, Turkey -- Labour and Social Security Minister Faruk Celik said on Tuesday (March 25th) that parliament plans to begin debating a key social security bill Thursday. 
His announcement followed talks with representatives of the opposition Republican People's Party, the Nationalist Movement Party and the Democratic Society Party.
Celik noted that a few articles of the bill will go into effect as soon as parliament approves it, while others will be implemented in May. 
Most of the provisions will be applied -- at least in part -- by the end of August, resulting in the law taking effect this year, as recommended by the IMF. 
Trade unions are concerned about the legislation, however, and have threatened to call a general strike.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu asked for and received a vote of confidence Tuesday (26 July) from the standing committee of his National Liberal Party (PNL).
Tariceanu had demanded the confidence motion following internal party disputes stemming from his announced resignation as prime minister, which he later reversed.
A former PNL leader, Theodor Stolojan, said he is ready to come back and replace Tariceanu both as prime minister and leader of the PNL presidency.
The majority of party officials, however, voiced support for Tariceanu.
He said on Tuesday that the party is working on a strategy to regain popularity and credibility following the recent instability.

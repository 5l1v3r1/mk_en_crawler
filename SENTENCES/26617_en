ANKARA, Turkey -- Seven troops were killed on Tuesday (September 8th) in armed clashes with rebels from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in eastern Turkey.
Five soldiers died and three were injured in a shootout in the city of Eruh in Siirt province, after the army launched an operation urging Kurdish insurgents based there to surrender.
Commandos were then sent to the region, where water and telephone lines have been cut.
Two other troops were killed in clashes with the PKK in the Cukurca district of Hakkari province.
In other news, at least 23 people were killed Tuesday amid flash floods caused by torrential rains in and around Istanbul.
Helicopters were dispatched to help people there, including drivers trapped in their cars and residents stranded on roofs.
The situation in the village of Selimpasa is particularly grave;
floods carried away vehicles and damaged homes.
The rain was described as the hardest the Istanbul area has seen in 80 years.
The BBC says one area received 24cm in just two hours.

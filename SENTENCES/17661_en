ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ljubljana and Zagreb have been working for the past month to resolve all outstanding issues, Croatia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration said in a statement Tuesday (July 24th). 
The talks cover bilateral disputes such as border delineation, the Krsko nuclear power plant, and Croatian deposits at Ljubljanska Banka. 
Referring disputes to the OSCE's Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is considered a possibility, though the ministry denies reports that Slovenia has officially proposed inviting former French Minister of Justice Robert Badinter to serve as a mediator.

ATHENS, Greece -- Two separate small blasts hit the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works ministry's headquarters early Thursday (December 4th), media reported.
Two gas cylinders exploded in front of the ministry's main building early in the morning, and another two went off 30 minutes later at a nearby building, causing minor damage.
A group calling itself the Revolutionary Organisation claimed responsibility in a phone call to a local radio station.
Late Wednesday, a small explosion damaged the offices of the AFP news agency in central Athens.
No one suffered injuries.
Police say small gas cooking canisters caused the blast.

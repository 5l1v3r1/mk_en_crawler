PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri told representatives of the Serb community on Tuesday (23 March) that those who orchestrated last week's violence committed "severe crimes against humanity".
He assured the Serbs that the international community is determined to find the perpetrators, who he says "tried to destroy the whole future of Kosovo".
An estimated 200 KFOR troops raided several houses in Obilic early Tuesday in search of evidence to determine who was behind the attacks on Serbs.
Two men were arrested.
In other news, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova told an Italian newspaper on Tuesday that last week's events underscored the need for Kosovo's independence.
He also wants a transfer of power from the UN administration to the local parliament.
Also Tuesday, the UN said one of its international police officers and a local policeman were killed when gunmen ambushed their patrol vehicle near Luzane, northeast of Pristina.

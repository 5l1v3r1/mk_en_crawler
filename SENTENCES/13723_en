TIRANA, Albania -- Agriculture Minister Jemin Gjana confirmed on Wednesday (22 March) that a second case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu has been found among dead poultry in Peze-Helmes, 10km east of Tirana.

Also Wednesday, Romania confirmed a new outbreak of avian influenza. 
Authorities say the H5N1 strain was detected in 12 domestic birds in the village of Magurele, near Bucharest. 
The area was quarantined and domestic fowl are being culled.

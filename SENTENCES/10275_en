BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The international community expected more from Belgrade in terms of stepping up war crimes co-operation and is losing patience with the sluggish progress, according to US special envoy for war crimes Pierre-Richard Prosper. 
Speaking Thursday (23 September), he said that "if Belgrade wants the issue of co-operation with The Hague to be resolved once and for all, then they must extradite Ratko Mladic." Prosper said the government could use security services to locate the indictee, adding there is information suggesting other indictees move freely around Serbia.

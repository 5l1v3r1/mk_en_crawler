TIRANA, Albania -- Serbian citizen Ratica Petrovic entered Albania on Monday (June 11th) at a border crossing in Kukes and requested political asylum. 
She said she had been fired from work in the Belgrade media because she had written several articles in support of Kosovo independence. 
"Now I am jobless and I cannot provide for myself. 
I came to Albania to ask for political asylum because I have been told that this is a democratic country," Petrovic said.

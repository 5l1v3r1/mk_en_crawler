SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) said on Wednesday (June 6th) it has information that escaped Bosnian Serb convict Radovan Stankovic is likely hiding in Serbia or Montenegro.
Stankovic, who was serving a 20-year sentence for war crimes in Foca, escaped from custody on May 25th.
SIPA deputy chief Dragan Lukac says BiH authorities are working with police in neighbouring Serbia and Montenegro to establish his whereabouts.
Stankovic is believed to have gained Serbian citizenship in 2004, while he was in custody at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Luka says Belgrade must revoke that citizenship to avoid potential legal problems involved with extradition, if Stankovic turns up in Serbia.

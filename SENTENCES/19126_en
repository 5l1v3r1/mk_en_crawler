SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Constitutional Court completely abolished on Saturday (March 31st) the entity coat-of-arms of Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH (FBiH), as well as the RS anthem, ruling that these are non-compliant with the state constitution.
The Court concluded that both entities failed to implement a prior ruling that stipulated the immediate adjustment of the entity symbols, in order to make them represent all three constituent peoples in BiH -- Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF's 24-member executive board approved a $495m loan to Turkey on Friday (16 April) and agreed to extend the assistance package for Ankara until February 2005. 
The loan is part of an $18.6 billion credit line, of which Turkey has so far used $16.2 billion. 
The IMF praised the government for its efforts to curb inflation and interest rates, but warned that Turkey has failed to meet certain targets related to the budget deficit, money supply, and job cuts in the administration.(Reuters, AFP, AP - 16/04/04)

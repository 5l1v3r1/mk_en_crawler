ZAGREB, Croatia -- A prosecutor demanded on Wednesday (May 21st) that two retired Croatian generals be sent to prison for failing to stop troops under their command from attacking Serb civilians in September 1993.
In his closing statement at the trial of generals Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac, Prosecutor Ante Kvakan said they should be punished for failing to prevent their subordinates from murdering 23 Serb civilians and five soldiers, and from arson and theft.
Ademi and Norac were commanders in the Medak Pocket area and are the highest ranking Croatian officers tried for atrocities against Serbs.
Both have pleaded not guilty.
A ruling is expected next month.

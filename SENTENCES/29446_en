ATHENS, Greece -- A team of 175 EU border control specialists is due to arrive in Greece on Tuesday (November 2nd) as part of the bloc's efforts to help the country deal with the growing influx of immigrants seeking illegal entry from Turkey. 
The Frontex rapid border intervention team will be deployed at the Orestiada area for up to two months. 
The EU decided in October to send the teams, following a request from Athens.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament announced Monday (25 November) that it will work overtime to pass all relevant legislation before the EU summit in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December.
The new government has presented an ambitious package of legislation, including rapid economic reforms, improving the judicial system and banning restrictions on expression of speech, religion or ethnic identity.
The leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said a nine-point emergency plan for meeting the EU's Copenhagen criteria would be implemented as soon as possible.
It includes constitutional amendments that would allow him to assume the post of prime minister, despite a 1999 conviction.
Erdogan meanwhile has launched another round of visits to Western European capitals, seeking support for a firm accession date at the Copenhagen summit.
He visited Lisbon on Monday, before flying on to Helsinki.

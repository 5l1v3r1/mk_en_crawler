BELGRADE, Serbia -- A lawmaker from the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) has been fined 336 euros for throwing her shoes at Deputy Parliament Speaker Gordana Comic on Thursday (November 26th). 
Parliament was debating a bill giving more power to the Vojvodina province, measures the SRS strongly opposes. 
Gordana Pop-Lazic explained that she threw her shoes after Comic refused to allow another SRS representative to make a statement. 
The session was then briefly interrupted when Pop-Lazic refused to leave the hall.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Thursday (June 10th) that the EU integration process of Western Balkan countries should not be held hostage to bilateral disputes in the region. 
Speaking at a round table in Brussels on the enlargement process and neighbourhood policy, Fuele stressed that a different framework for resolving open issues must be found. 
He reiterated that the pace of the process will depend on the reforms implemented by each country, adding there is no enlargement fatigue within the EU.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministry announced on Thursday (May 19th) it has declared Libyan chargÃ© d'affaires Abdulkarim Naas persona non-grata due to activities "inappropriate to the diplomatic practice". 
According to local media, it is because of his pro-Gaddaffi stance and media comments criticising Croatia's support for foreign intervention in Libya. 
Zagreb expects Naas to leave the country soon, but stressed that the move does not mean halting diplomatic ties with Libya.

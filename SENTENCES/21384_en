BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Council hopes that Serbia will form a pro-European government that "will engage constructively in the Stabilisation and Association (SAA) process", according to a statement issued after EU foreign ministers met on Monday (May 26th) in Brussels.
"The Council reiterated that Serbia will be able to advance further on its EU path, including candidate status, once the necessary conditions are met."
Outgoing Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said after the meeting that a government based on pro-European values -- formed by coalitions led by the Democratic Party and the Serbian Socialist Party -- would be absolutely acceptable to the EU.
He added that parties that seek to annul the SAA are a problem in the eyes of the Union.

PRISTINA, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK has completely ruled out the possibility of parliament changing the Kosovo Constitutional Framework. 
UNMIK spokeswoman Izabella Karlowicz said Wednesday (7 January) that only the UN Security Council can amend the document, and that this would not happen before Kosovo's final status is resolved.

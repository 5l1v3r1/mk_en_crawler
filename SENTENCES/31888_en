BRUSSELS, Belgium -- France, backed by several EU members, has suggested that the EU should enhance its military role and replace the NATO mission in Macedonia.
The United Kingdom opposes the idea, insisting that future operations in Macedonia should be conducted only through co-operation within NATO.
The Macedonian government has indicated it would not object if NATO troops were replaced by an EU mission.

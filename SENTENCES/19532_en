TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is the first nation to complete destruction of its declared chemical weapons stockpile under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-proliferation Donald A. 
Mahley said Friday (August 24th). 
Last month, Albania finished destroying around 16 tonnes of the weapons, dating back to the period in which Albania had close relations with the Soviet Union.

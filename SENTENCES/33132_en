WASHINGTON, United States -- UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte reiterated on Friday (16 May) that former Bosnian Serbian army commander Ratko Mladic is in Serbia.
Speaking before the US Congress Helsinki Committee, del Ponte said she has up-to-date information on Mladic's whereabouts, but is not sure who should receive this information.
Serbian government and military authorities insist it has been a year since Mladic contacted the army.

VATICAN -- Turkey has many problems with regard to basic human rights, and most of all with freedom of religion, according to EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen.
The commissioner made the statement on Friday (9 May), after a meeting with Vatican Foreign Minister Jean-Louis Tauran.
Verheugen said the issue was one of his main reasons for visiting the Vatican, adding that the Catholic Church did not have rights in Turkey.(Anadolu Agency, TRT 2 - 09/05/03)

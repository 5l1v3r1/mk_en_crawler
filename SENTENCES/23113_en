SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, signed a coalition agreement Thursday (May 1st) with 18 smaller political parties ahead of the June 1st snap elections. 
The coalition includes the Democratic Alliance, the Socialist Party of Macedonia, the Democratic Renewal of Macedonia and the Party of Justice.
Meanwhile, the New Social Democratic Party (NDSP), a coalition partner in the outgoing government, announced on Thursday that it will join the coalition "For a European Macedonia", led by the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM). 
NDSP member and outgoing Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski, former lawmaker Vele Mitanovski and former Economy Minister Vera Rafajlovska announced that they are leaving the NDSP and are forming their own faction after the party's decision to join the SDSM. 
Elenovski says there have been "conceptual differences" between two groups within the party for months. 
The NDSP holds seven of the 120 seats in parliament.

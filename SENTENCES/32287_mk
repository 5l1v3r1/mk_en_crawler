MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- Magdalena (Maggie) Maleeva scored an upset victory over the second-best player in the world, Venus Williams, in the Kremlin Cup's second round, beating her two sets to one. 
This was Williams' first defeat in three years, except for this year's US Open Final, which she lost to her sister, Serena. 
After the win in Moscow, Maleeva is likely to return to the Top 20 of the Women's Tennis Association rankings.

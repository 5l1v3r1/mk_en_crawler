MOSCOW, Russia -- President Vladimir Putin met Tuesday (24 December) with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling party, in a bid to bolster trade ties.
Putin said the victory of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party would enhance co-operation between the two states, implying that the previous administration had turned a blind eye to Chechen terrorist groups that trained in Turkey.
It is an allegation Ankara has long denied.
Erdogan insisted the purpose of his visit was purely economic.
He brought with him a 170-strong business delegation representing various sectors.

ROME, Italy -- Franco Frattini, the new European commissioner for justice, said Monday (24 January) that Turkey's bid for membership in the EU is a model for those "forces in the Islamic world that want to modernise their institutions".
He added that launching accession talks with Ankara would also accelerate the resumption of dialogue between the EU and other Mediterranean countries.

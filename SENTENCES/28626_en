ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry announced on Thursday (August 12th) that Turkey is establishing its own commission to investigate Israel's May 31st attack on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead. 
The panel will include representatives of the interior, justice and foreign ministries, as well as marine administration officials. 
It will present its findings to an UN-led commission that is already investigating the incident. 
That panel met on Thursday in New York. 
"The discussions were held in good co-operation and positive atmosphere," UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said. 
Israel too has set up an investigating commission.
In other news, local media reported that police acting on a tip deactivated a bomb placed outside the headquarters for riot police in Ankara on Friday. 
According to the Anadolu news agency, the explosive device was planted about 100m from the building. 
CNN Turk says the bomb was made of 3.5kg of plastic explosives, something the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has used in the past.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) will support a government reshuffle that includes reducing the number of cabinet ministries from 24 to 12, SNS leader Tomislav Nikolic said on Monday (February 21st). 
However, Nikolic insisted that this support would hinge on the adoption of an SNS proposal from December. 
It would reduce the number of lawmakers by half to 125, a move parliament rejected.

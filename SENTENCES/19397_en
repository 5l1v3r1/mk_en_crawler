PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament Secretary General Milan Radovic said on Sunday (August 26th) that the date of the session to review Montenegro's new constitution draft will be chosen this week. 
Adopting the new constitution is a chief priority, Radovic added, noting that as early as the first regular session of the autumn plenary session, deputies will be given 17 bills to review. 
A new constitution is needed in light of Montenegro's split from Serbia last summer.

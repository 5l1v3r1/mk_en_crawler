NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police announced on Saturday (January 9th) that they are searching for those who removed and threw away the Greek flag hanging at the grave of former Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos.
His very remains were stolen from the grave about a month ago.
According to a witness, a Cypriot flag that was on a flagpole alongside the Greek one was untouched.
The incident was discovered by two guards who check on the grave every morning.
Papadopoulos' remains were stolen on December 11th 2009, the first anniversary of his death.
Police are still looking for the perpetrators of that crime.

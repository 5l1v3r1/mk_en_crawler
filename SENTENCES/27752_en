BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic and UN Resident Co-ordinator to Serbia William Infante signed a new, five-year partnership strategy Friday (June 25th) in Belgrade.
Worth $250m, it will support Serbia's EU accession efforts.
After the ceremony, Jeremic described the strategy as marking a new era in co-operation between Serbia and the UN.
"The UN is proud that Serbia sees it as a reliable partner," Infante said in response.
The strategy focuses on three main areas -- responsible governance, sustainable development and social inclusion, and regional stability and co-operation.

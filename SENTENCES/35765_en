ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (1 June) that the government's priority is EU integration and that the controversial education bill would, for the time being, be dropped from the agenda.
The education bill was approved by parliament last month, but President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed it.
Erdogan said the issue would be put on hold and discussed again later.
In other news, Turkey reportedly has launched an unprecedented security effort for the NATO summit in Istanbul later this month.
Three NATO AWACS aircraft will be patrolling the skies during the meeting, backed by 30,000 police officers deployed around the city.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The self-declared terrorist Serb organisation Beli Orlovi says it killed Bosniak leader Sefko Salkovic last week in northern Kosovo, media reported on Monday (December 13th). 
In a letter left near the office of Danish KFOR troops in Zubin Potok, the organisation also claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack on a KFOR facility there. 
It also threatened KFOR, EULEX and Kosovo Police for securing Sunday's snap elections. 
The letter is signed by Beli Orlovi. 
Kosovo police and EULEX have confirmed the existence of the letter.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), ruling coalition partners, came out strongly Wednesday (March 4th) against proposed constitutional amendments allowing two or more elections on the same day. 
They were responding to a proposal by the third ruling coalition partner, the National Movement for Stability and Progress, which wants to hold elections for both the European Parliament and Bulgaria's parliament on the same day rather than have them fall within three months of each other. 
With both the BSP and the MRF opposing the idea, the amendments have no chance of passing.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders is concerned about a wave of threats against journalists in Kosovo and insists European authorities address the matter through EULEX, local media reported on Friday (March 12th). 
The watchdog group expressed concern in a report accusing police of trying to conceal several cases involving threats against journalists. 
While government spokesman Memli Krasniqi expressed reservations about the report, EULEX said it is alarmed by the findings.

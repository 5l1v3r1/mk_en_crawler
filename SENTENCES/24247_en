ANKARA, Turkey -- Police seized a cache of guns and hand grenades in five simultaneous raids in the northern city of Trabzon and in the nearby village of Yomra on Saturday (December 13th), media reported.
Authorities said the weapons resemble those found previously in police operations against the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon, whose suspected members are currently on trial for plotting a coup against the pro-Islamic government.
Four people were taken in for questioning after Saturday's raids.
In other news, two members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) surrendered to Turkish security forces in the south-eastern province of Hakkari late Saturday, media reported Sunday.
The pair had joined the PKK three months ago, but recently escaped from a training camp in northern Iraq.

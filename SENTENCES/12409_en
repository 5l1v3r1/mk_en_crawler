BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting in Brussels on Thursday (9 June), NATO defence ministers confirmed that KFOR would "maintain its full operational capability of around 17,000 troops".
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the decision to maintain combat capability in Kosovo was based on the recently initiated standards review process in the province.
NATO reported that it has tripled its crowd control capability in light of disturbances and riots that occurred in March 2004.
A NATO press release adds that the start of status negotiations, which depends on the standards review, is "widely regarded as a very important moment for Kosovo's future".

ANKARA, Turkey -- Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu and his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, have agreed to increase efforts to boost trade and economic co-operation, the two ministers told a joint news conference after they met in Ankara Friday (25 March). 
Co-operation in the energy sector is an especially important priority, the two leaders said.
Also on Friday, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his government expects to begin the process that will eventually lead to signing an enlarged customs trade union agreement with the EU, including Cyprus. 
Signing the document is a prerequisite for the start of EU membership talks with Turkey, slated to begin on 3 October.

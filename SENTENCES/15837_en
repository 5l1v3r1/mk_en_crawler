BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities reportedly prevented Marko Lugonja, one of those charged with aiding fugitive Ratko Mladic, from leaving the country on Thursday (21 September).
He had boarded a plane bound for Moscow but was taken off at the last minute at the Belgrade airport.
The trial against Lugonja and eight other defendants is to begin at the Belgrade regional court next week.

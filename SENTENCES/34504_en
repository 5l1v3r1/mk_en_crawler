NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council issued a report Wednesday (8 October), saying that the security situation in Kosovo has deteriorated somewhat in recent months because of "a large number of shootings and grenade/bomb attacks". 
The report concluded that the situation was stable but "less secure".
In other news, the Kosovo Assembly defied a call by Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi and again postponed a vote that would have allowed a delegation to participate in internationally sponsored talks with Serbia-Montenegro in Vienna next week.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community has called on the BiH Council of Ministers to submit the crucial draft law on higher education to parliament. 
In a joint statement issued Monday (23 February), the Office of the High Representative, the OSCE, the World Bank, the European Commission's Delegation and the Council of Europe described the failure to submit the crucial bill on time as "alarming". 
The country risks losing financial assistance totaling $42m from the World Bank if the law is not adopted by 31 March.
In other news, top BiH military official Enes Besirbasic said on Monday that state institutions working to combat terrorism are improving with each day. 
He spoke during an international two-day conference in Sarajevo.

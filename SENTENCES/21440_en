BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic began a two-day visit to Iran on Tuesday (July 29th) to attend a ministerial conference of the Nonalignment Movement. 
That is an international organisation of countries that consider themselves free of formal alignments with or against any major international power bloc. 
Jeremic will address participants in the conference and hold separate meetings with the heads of delegations from Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Algeria, Brunei, Kenya, Cuba, Iran, Pakistan, Bhutan, Laos, Bangladesh, Singapore, Venezuela, Panama, Chile, Colombia, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Bolivia. 
Jeremic is expected to lobby for Serbia's initiative to ask the International Court of Justice to determine whether Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence complied with international law. 
Serbia plans to launch its initiative at a UN General Assembly session scheduled for September.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers on Monday (February 21st) urged Bosnian political leaders to quickly finalise government formation talks. 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said after the meeting that the bloc will continue debate regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in March when it will discuss the possibility of strengthening the EU presence in the country and potentially draft a new strategy on how to accelerate EU integration reforms. 
BiH held general elections on October 3rd, but there is still no government in the larger entity, the Federation of BiH. 
Nor is there a new state-level cabinet, due wrangling among the main Bosniak and Croat parties.

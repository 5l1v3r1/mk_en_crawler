BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 20,000 people are expected to stage a protest in Bucharest Tuesday (October 7th).
Four trade unions are participating, demanding higher salaries and respect for employees' rights.
The protest, the last in a series, coincides with the World Day for Decent Work.
In other news, the union representing doctors in Romania announced it will seek a salary hike for members if the government boosts the wages of teachers and public servants.
Delegates approved the resolution at the union's general meeting at the weekend.
Last week, parliament's lower house unanimously adopted a 50% increase in teachers' wages.
That sparked a series of demands from unions representing other workers, including all state employees.
According to the finance ministry, a 50% hike for all state employees would trigger a budget deficit of 7% of GDP next year and would jeopardise both economic stability and EU membership.
The government will discuss the matter with public servants' representatives to avoid a general strike, says Labour Minister Mariana Campeanu.
She warned that if the government fulfils all requests by unions, the country would face financial collapse.

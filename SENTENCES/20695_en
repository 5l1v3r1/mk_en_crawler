SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The mandate of the Office of the High Representative could end with the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU or the granting of EU candidate status to BiH, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Wednesday (November 7th). 
He insisted that BiH could achieve these goals before his mandate is scheduled to end -- in July 2008 -- but reiterated that failed efforts at police reform remain the biggest obstacle to EU integration. 
Lajcak stressed that the recent Mostar declaration on police reform was a step forward in this respect and said he is optimistic negotiations would continue.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Deniz Baykal, president of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), stepped down on Monday (May 10th) as a result of a sex scandal. 
A tape uploaded to the internet Friday apparently showed him having an affair with a female CHP lawmaker. 
At the weekend, fellow party members and the media insisted Baykal resign.
During a televised press conference, Baykal, 71, said the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) leaked the video, which was reportedly made eight years ago. 
He described it as a "conspiracy". 
The AKP denied the accusation and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Baykal's comments as "ugly". 
The CHP will hold an extraordinary congress to elect a new leader this month.

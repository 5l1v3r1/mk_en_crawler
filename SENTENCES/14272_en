BRUSSELS, Belgium -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Christian Schwarz-Schilling met with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Brussels on Monday (13 February) and said he hoped BiH would join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme this year. 
He praised the progress achieved so far, while warning that more must be done in meeting obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. 
While in Brussels, he also met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.
In other news Wednesday, Republika Srpska Prime Minister-designate Milorad Dodik says parliament will vote on his cabinet in two weeks.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- Prime ministers from Slovakia, Hungary, Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo -- Robert Fico, Ferenc Gyurcsany, Sali Berisha, Milo Djukanovic and Hashim Thaci -- as well as Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, participated in a two-day regional summit in Dubrovnik that opened Friday (July 4th). 
The forum focused on the EU prospects of Southeast Europe and issues related to security, progress and prosperity. 
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader denied any discouragement in his country due to the failure of some EU member states to approve the Lisbon Treaty. 
"The EU has always found solutions to serious problems, so I believe it will find one this time too -- not only for the new members but for itself," Sanader said.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva said Sunday (12 June) that the warning letter sent by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is part of the normal monitoring procedure. 
Rehn forwarded such letters to Sofia and Bucharest last week. 
Kuneva noted that prior to their accession, the newest EU members -- including Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states -- were also warned about issues and delays.
On Saturday, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov urged all parties that win seats in the 25 June parliamentary vote to work immediately on passing EU-related legislation, rather than taking a recess.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Press reports suggesting that Washington opposes the nomination of Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko as new high representative are completely false, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Stuart Jones said during a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday (March 3rd). 
He added that his country is holding intensive talks with the EU and with the other members of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) -- Russia and Turkey -- regarding the new high representative but has never opposed any nominee.
Incumbent High Representative Miroslav Lajcak resigned in early February to become Slovakia's new foreign minister. 
At a meeting late last month, the EU proposed Inzko, Austria's ambassador to Slovenia, to replace Lajcak. 
The appointment requires confirmation by the PIC at its session later this month.

TIRANA, Albania -- Sali Berisha, leader of Albania's main opposition Democratic Party (DP), implied Monday (16 May) that he might withdraw from politics if his party is defeated during the 3 July parliamentary elections. 
The DP leader added, however, that a scenario in which DP is defeated in the parliamentary vote was "unimaginable". 
He repeated that strengthening of democracy and expansion freedoms were amid the priority tasks of his party, as well as combating corruption and Euro-Atlantic integration.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Democratic governments cannot stop citizens from sending a new humanitarian aid flotilla to Gaza, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Monday (May 30th), a year after a Turkish vessel was attacked by Israeli commandos, leaving six Turkish activists dead. 
His statement was in response to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who on Friday urged governments to try to persuade activists to give up plans to send a second aid flotilla. 
"No democratic country can think it has general control over NGOs," Davutoglu stated. 
NGOs are planning the second flotilla next month.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said on Tuesday (31 January) that he is prepared to put off next week's parliamentary session on the independence referendum, to allow more time for political consensus on the issue. 
Vujanovic made the offer during a meeting with EU security chief Javier Solana's special envoy to Podgorica, Miroslav Lajcak, who is working to hammer out an agreement between the ruling coalition and opposition on the terms of the referendum. 
Vujanovic stressed, however, that even if the 7 February parliamentary session is postponed, the referendum must take place in April, as planned.

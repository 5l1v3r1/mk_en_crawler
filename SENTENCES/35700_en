BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) currently poses the main obstacle to BiH's future, particularly on the road to EU integration, warned High Representative Paddy Ashdown during talks with RS officials in Banja Luka on Monday (5 April).
He cited a number of key issues, including the failure to adopt laws on public procurement and the failure to co-operate efficiently with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

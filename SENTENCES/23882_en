TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) warned on Wednesday (March 18th) that the process of issuing new electronic ID cards is about to fail. 
SP leader Edi Rama proposed a draft law to issue the identification documents for free, arguing that many citizens have trouble paying for them. 
His proposal would allow more people to vote in the June 28th general elections. 
In response, the government urged the opposition not to ruin the process that it says makes Albanians equal to other Europeans.

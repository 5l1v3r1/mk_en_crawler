ATHENS, Greece -- Employees in the banking sector are staging a strike Monday (10 July), to protest failed talks on new collective labour contracts for 2006. 
The Hellenic Federation of Bank Employee Unions blamed the employers' association for the failure, since the association failed to send negotiators to the latest meetings.

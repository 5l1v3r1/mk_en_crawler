SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, who also holds the chairmanship of the OSCE, said during a visit to Skopje on Monday (18 October) that the organisation's mission in the Balkans is now over.
"The OSCE has completed an important and fruitful job here and we consider that it is high time the missions be reduced and terminated.
Our interest must be now in other regions," he said.
Passy and his counterpart in Skopje, Ilinka Mitreva, agreed to open a fourth border crossing between the two countries at Delcevo - Nevestin.
Passy continues his tour of the region Tuesday with stops in Belgrade and Pristina.

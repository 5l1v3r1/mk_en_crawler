TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition is strongly criticising the governmentâ€™s recently adopted action plan for EU integration, local media reported Wednesday (1 September).
The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) said the document reflects the "hypocritical" position of the government towards the EU.
A DP spokeswoman cited findings of about 328.5m euros worth of fraud during a recent state audit.
In other news Wednesday, it was announced that construction of the Albanian-Macedonian-Bulgarian Oil pipeline AMBO would start in 2005.
The Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian governments have all approved the project in principle.

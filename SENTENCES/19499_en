SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement Friday (November 23rd), Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian reiterated that the arrest of war crimes suspects -- by undermining their support networks -- remains one of the international community's key tasks in BiH.
He praised the raids in Pale last week on the homes of fugitive Radovan Karadzic's wife and children, noting that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague remains a Dayton Accord requirement and has a direct bearing on BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration bid.
In other news Friday, a war crimes indictee in BiH made an unprecedented confession.
Under a plea bargain agreement with state prosecutors, Idhan Sipic, 40, has admitted that he murdered a woman in September 1995 and threw her body into a well in Kljuc municipality.
In exchange for the confession, Sipic -- who surrendered last month -- will be sentenced to between six and ten years in prison.

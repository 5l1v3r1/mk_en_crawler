BUCHAREST, Romania -- Employees of the Romanian Post Office (CNPR) suspended a planned ten-day strike Monday (18 April) after reaching a partial agreement with management shortly after the protests were launched. 
Representatives of the trade unions at the state-run company say monthly salaries would be raised by 4 per cent on average. 
CNPR employs 35,000 people.

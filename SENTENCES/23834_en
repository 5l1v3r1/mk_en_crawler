BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's Czech presidency has received the European Commission's report on progress that countries in the Western Balkan have made in meeting the criteria for joining the EU's visa-free travel area, media reported on Tuesday (May 19th).
The document is now in the hands of member states to discuss and amend before any final version emerges.
According to media reports, only Macedonia has fulfilled all the conditions to implement a visa-free regime.
Visa requirements could be abolished for Montenegrin citizens, but Serbia still faces "certain difficulties" regarding visa liberalisation, the document reportedly says.
Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina reportedly have failed to meet the benchmarks for visa liberalisation.

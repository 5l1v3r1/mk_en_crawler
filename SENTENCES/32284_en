SKOPJE, Macedonia -- France's newly appointed Army Chief of Staff, Gen Henri Bentegeat, met Tuesday (5 November) with his Macedonian counterpart, Lt Gen Metodi Stamboliski, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and President Boris Trajkovski.
The talks focused on bilateral military co-operation, the current security situation, and the possible international military presence in Macedonia after 15 December, when NATO's Amber Fox extended mandate expires.
The local media quotes Buckovski as saying he believes the international military presence should continue next year, though reduced in size and with strengthened civil control over the mission.

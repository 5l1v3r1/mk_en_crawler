ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government announced on Saturday (November 21st) that it has fired three of the four top managers at state-controlled highway company HAC, which has been hit by a series of corruption scandals. 
Transport Minister Bozidar Kalmeta said that the decision to sack the senior officials was prompted by the government's plan to improve the enterprise because "the normal running of business [was] impossible". 
The local media has been reporting on corruption at the company, however Kalmeta denied those allegations. 
"Relations within HAC are the only reason. 
Our goal now is to make the new management free of political influence," the minister said. 
HAC is in charge of the functioning, construction and maintenance of highways in Croatia.

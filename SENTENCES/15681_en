BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Senate Thursday (November 23rd) rejected a draft bill regulating elections for members of the European Parliament (EP). 
It specified that Romanian MEPs should be elected from a single national ticket. 
The vote, preceded by fierce debate, took members of the ruling coalition by surprise, triggering accusations that the opposition threatened national interests by abstaining from the vote.
In Sofia, meanwhile, the three-party ruling coalition said on Thursday that it would be inclined to support single ticket elections for the EP. 
Both Bulgaria and Romania are to hold the elections in the spring.

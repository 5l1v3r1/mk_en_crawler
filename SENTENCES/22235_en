PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Members of the cabinet, along with representatives of the opposition, issued a joint statement Saturday (April 12th) saying UNMIK should prevent Serbia from holding local elections on Kosovo's territory.
The statement was in response to UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker's proposal to allow the elections in five Kosovo municipalities with Serb majorities.
Both the government and opposition in Kosovo reject that idea.
Separately, the Serbian Electoral Commission late Friday approved monitoring of the May 11th vote by the OSCE.
Russia also plans to send observers next month.

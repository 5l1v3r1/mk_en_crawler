BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Milorad Dodik vowed on Monday (November 15th) to resist a unified BiH and oppose any attempt to diminish the powers or the responsibilities of Republika Srpska (RS). 
During his inauguration as the new president of the smaller BiH entity, Dodik said he insists on an autonomous RS and will not give up this idea even if it costs BiH its EU entry. 
He added that RS will accept no new laws or resolutions imposed by the High Representative. 
Still, Dodik said he remains open to dialogue with Federation of BiH politicians on constitutional reform and other key issues. 
The RS parliament on Monday held its first session after the October 3rd general elections. 
The 83 lawmakers took oaths of office and re-elected Igor Radojcic as parliament speaker. 
Emil Vlajki and Enes Suljkanovic are the RS vice presidents. 
Serbian President Boris Tadic was among the guests at the ceremony.

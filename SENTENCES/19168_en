SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev urged the EU on Wednesday (January 30th) to assume a strong, united policy regarding the Western Balkans, to avoid destabilisation following Kosovo's expected declaration of independence.
Only a more unified and more active EU policy for the Western Balkans can guarantee democracy, economic and social stability and help handle the consequences of the conflicts of the 1990s, Stanishev said after a session of the Bulgarian Council of Minister's Security Council.
He also said Bulgaria would like to see a clear EU perspective for Serbia.

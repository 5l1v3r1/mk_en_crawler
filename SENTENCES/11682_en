BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Eight former secret police officers have been sentenced for kidnapping and murdering former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic in August 2000, on orders from Slobodan Milosevic.
They were also accused of trying to kill politician Vuk Draskovic.
Milorad "Legija" Ulemek, thought to have subsequently masterminded the 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, was given a 40-year prison sentence term.
Three others -- Branko Bercek, Dusan Maricic and Nenad Bujosevic -- also received 40-year sentences, while the others were given 15 years.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's war crimes court opened the trial Friday (April 6th) of Bosnian Serbs Mitar Rasevic and Savo Todovic.
They are accused of participating in a joint criminal enterprise whose purpose was to imprison non-Serbs from Foca in inhuman conditions between 1992 and 1994.
Todovic was deputy warden of the local prison, which was used as a camp, and Rasevic supervised at least 37 guards.
The two men refused to enter pleas ahead of the trial, but have insisted they committed no crimes.
In other news, the OSCE issued a statement Sunday to mark the International Day of Roma.
It condemned discrimination against the Roma minority in BiH, saying this results in extreme poverty and unequal access to health care, education, employment, and adequate housing.

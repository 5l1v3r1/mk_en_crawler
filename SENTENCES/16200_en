ISTANBUL, Turkey -- At least four people were injured in a bomb explosion in the central Istanbul district of Eminonu Thursday (15 June) morning, according to local media reports.
The bomb was planted in a rubbish bin near a bus terminal.
Though no group has claimed responsibility for the blast, police reportedly suspect the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers' Party.
Also Thursday, local media are reporting that the closed door trial against a 16-year old Turkish high school student, accused of gunning down Roman Catholic priest Andrea Santoro in February, has been delayed for a month.
The Trabzon court on Wednesday reportedly adjourned the next hearing until 13 July, after two witnesses failed to appear.

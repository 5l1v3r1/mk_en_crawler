MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK police announced on Tuesday (5 September) that the main bridge in Mitrovica, separating the Albanian and Serb quarters of the ethnically divided city, would re-open to some traffic on Thursday. 
Local Serbs have agreed to re-open the bridge to UN and KFOR vehicles, including those carrying ethnic Albanians, who have business in the northern, Serb-populated part of the city. 
The bridge has been closed since 26 August, when an ethnic Albanian youngster lobbed a bomb into a cafÃ© in northern Mitrovica, injuring ten people.

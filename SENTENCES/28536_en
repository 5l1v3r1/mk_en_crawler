ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou vowed on Sunday (November 14th) to continue with reforms after preliminary results of the second round of local elections showed his PASOK party won in most regions, despite unpopular austerity measures. 
His socialists won in Athens for the first time in 24 years. 
Based on 73% of the votes counted, PASOK candidates are leading in eight of the 13 regions, while conservatives from the New Democracy (ND) party lead in the other five. 
Incumbent Athens Mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis of the ND conceded to PASOK opponent Giorgos Kaminis, who promised to address poverty and challenges stemming from immigration in the city of more than four million people. 
The vote was marked by low turnout -- 46%, with over 10% of the votes declared void or invalid.

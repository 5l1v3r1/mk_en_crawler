BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The parliament of Republika Srpska voted on Tuesday (28 February) to elect opposition leader Milorad Dodik as prime minister. 
The deputies also approved his proposed cabinet, which includes no representatives of the nationalist Serb Democratic Party (SDS). 
The SDS, which had ruled the entity since it was founded during the 1992-1995 BiH conflict, lost power in January after failing to win lawmakers' approval for its 2006 budget. 
Parliament Speaker Dusan Stojicic of the SDS is being succeeded by Igor Radojic of Dodik's Union of Independent Social Democrats.

TIRANA, Albania -- An interim report issued by the OSCE Presence in Albania Monday (14 February) pointed to deficiencies in the development of free trials. 
The document was prepared by an observation team that monitored homicide, trafficking and armed robbery cases at the Tirana District Court and First Instance Court for Serious Crimes. 
According to the findings, the most common problems involve inadequate information management, frequent postponements, and non-compliance with security standards.
Also Monday, Tirana media reported that the European Commission has called on the government to make changes to its action plan for EU integration. 
Brussels reportedly believes that some draft measures need attention, particularly in the areas of human rights and freedoms, minorities and the media.

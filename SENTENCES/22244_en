ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors have prepared an indictment of 60 people in the case of leftist activist Engin Ceber, who died in an Istanbul prison last month, media reported on Monday (November 17th). 
The suspects include gendarmerie, police and prison officials. 
The incident led to the suspension of 19 prison guards and the arrest of six of them in October. 
Authorities launched the investigation after human rights groups alleged that jailers beat Ceber to death. 
He died of a brain haemorrhage. 
Police detained Ceber in September for staging a protest against a case of police brutality.

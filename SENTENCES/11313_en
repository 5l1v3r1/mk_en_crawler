ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader warned on Thursday (27 January) of the danger of a resurgence of anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and extremism.
Remembering the victims of Auschwitz, he said the genocide during World War II must not be forgotten.
Sanader's Croatian Democratic Union has been accused in the past of failing to properly denounce the mass murders committed by Croatia's Ustasha regime.
In other news, the Women of Srebrenica Association issued a statement marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.
They said the murder of Srebrenica civilians in 1995 demonstrated "fascism and genocide" have not been rooted out of Europe.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR personnel arrested a Bosnian Serb on Wednesday (28 January), who is thought to be a bodyguard of the most wanted war crimes suspect, Radovan Karadzic.
A police spokeswoman in Bijeljina identified the man as Zeljko Jankovic, also known as "Luna", who is often mentioned in the local press as the wartime Bosnian Serb leader's bodyguard.
Local media are quoting witnesses who say he was apprehended while taking his children to school.
Jankovic is the second alleged member of what SFOR calls Karadzic's "support network" to be arrested this month.

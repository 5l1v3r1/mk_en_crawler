TIRANA, Albania -- Albania may be included in a list of countries where NATO's missile defence shield will be deployed, local media reported on Sunday (May 9th). 
According to diplomatic sources, NATO is looking into whether to include Albania alongside Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. 
The issue was discussed last month when NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made his first official visit to Albania and Croatia. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha assured him Albania is prepared to meet all its obligations as a NATO member, including hosting the shield on its territory.

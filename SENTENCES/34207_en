SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of the ruling Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia and the opposition VMRO-DPMNE started another round of talks Tuesday (8 July), this time focused on the new bill concerning administrative division of the country. 
The government is likely to review the draft version on Monday. 
VMRO-DPMNE expressed serious reservations, especially over plans to reduce the number of municipalities from 123 to 60, which it says could deepen interethnic problems.
In other news, Tuesday's planned opening of a new interim crossing at Tanusevci-Debalde along the Macedonian-Kosovo border had to be postponed, due to protests on both sides of the border. 
UNMIK says the crossing will be opened, despite the delay.

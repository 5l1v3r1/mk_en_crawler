SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov's decree scheduling the European Parliament (EP) elections for May 20th was published in State Gazette on Friday (March 9th). 
The resolution leaves political parties with just over two months to prepare for the vote. 
Opinion polls suggest that five parties -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party, GERB, Movement for Rights and Freedoms, Attack and the United Democratic Forces -- will win seats in the EP. 
Earlier this week, the president sealed the law on EP elections, but expressed concerns regarding the provision that restricts the participation of expatriate voters.

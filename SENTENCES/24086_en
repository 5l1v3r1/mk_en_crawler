ANKARA, Turkey -- The government will introduce a drastic ban on smoking in cafes, restaurants and bars across the country Sunday (July 19th), according to media reports Thursday.
Authorities plan to fine violators in an attempt to help the country kick the habit, which kills thousands of people every year.
This is an extension of legislation passed last year that banned smoking in offices and public places.
Authorities gave cafes and restaurants 18 months to implement the new rules.
After the transition period expires Sunday, owners of these businesses will have to remove ashtrays and put up signs informing smokers of the ban and related fines.
Official statistics suggest that more than 30% of all adults in Turkey smoke.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Leading a delegation visiting Washington, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Thursday (24 July) that the United States is satisfied with Serbia-Montenegro's war crimes co-operation. 
Zivkovic, who met with US Ambassador for War Crimes Richard Prosper, said the sides agreed that arresting former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic is the last remaining obstacle to even fuller co-operation. 
Zivkovic said Belgrade's job is to convince the international community that Mladic is not in Serbia.

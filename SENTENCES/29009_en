BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court on Monday (June 7th) struck down the so-called lustration law, which aimed to ban senior officials during the communist-era regime -- 1945-1989 -- from holding ranking public posts now.
The legislation, adopted by parliament on May 19th, bars such personnel from holding or running for important government positions for a period of five years after the law is enforced.
Once parliament approved it, 29 members of the senate and 58 lawmakers from the chamber of deputies challenged its constitutionality.
The Court's decision is binding and final.
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Roberta Anastase says amendments would be made to bring the bill in line with the constitution after the Court explains its ruling.

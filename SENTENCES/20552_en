PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK's main building in Pristina was evacuated on Wednesday (October 10th) after security personnel detected a suspicious object on the underside of a vehicle. 
The car, operated by UN police, was stopped at the gates of the compound. 
UNMIK staff were told to leave the building while Irish soldiers serving with KFOR searched the car. 
Despite reports of a controlled explosion, police later said it was a false alarm.
In other news, several hundred young ethnic Albanians marched through downtown Pristina on Wednesday to demand independence for Kosovo. 
Student leaders said the peaceful rally was in part to protest delays in the status process.

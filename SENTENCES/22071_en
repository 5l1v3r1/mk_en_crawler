SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), a member of Bulgaria's ruling coalition, re-elected former Bulgarian king and Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg as its leader Saturday (October 18th).
Delegates at the party congress also adopted a new code that separates the party and the government's executive branch, so that ministers can no longer hold leadership positions in party structures.
The congress further approved several key party priorities -- stable economic growth, low taxes and stable public finances, as well as a programme of reforms in several sectors.

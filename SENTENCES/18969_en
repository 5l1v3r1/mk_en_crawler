BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The international community largely welcomed the roadmap for Kosovo status put forward by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari on Friday (February 2nd). 
EU security chief Javier Solana said Brussels backs the plan, and called on Belgrade and Pristina to engage and cooperate actively with Ahtisaari on the proposal. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn also urged "a real compromise".
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, meanwhile, said the proposal presented "a way forward" and offered "a prospect of a better, more secure future for the entire region, including integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures". 
In Washington, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States expected the Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders to work for a solution.
In other news, a closed-door session on provincial security was held Saturday (February 3rd) in Gracanica. 
It gathered representatives of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), Kosovo provisional institutions, the Serbian Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo, the Serbian community and NGOs. 
Afterwards, KFOR Commander Lieutenant-General Roland Kather reiterated that KFOR would react fast and decisively in case of violence.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Speaking at a news conference Saturday (23 July), Turkish Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu called for "sincere" international co-operation in the fight against terrorism. 
''Terrorism has no religion or nationality," Aksu said, condemning the recent attacks in London and Egypt and reiterating his government's call for a wide international antiterrorism campaign. 
He also cited the terrorist activities of the banned Kurdistan People's Party (PKK), which he said are posing a threat to Turkey.
Ankara has sealed 50 security co-operation agreements in this area thus far, according to Aksu. 
He announced that Turkey proposed a comprehensive co-operation agreement during last week's meeting of the interior ministers of Iraq and its neighbours in Istanbul. 
The proposed deal would help ensure border security and combat terrorism in the region, the minister said.

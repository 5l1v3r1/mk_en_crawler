BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Milorad Dodik, a former prime minister of Republika Srpska, is to appear before the UN war crimes tribunal by the end of this week to testify in the trial of Radoslav Brdjanin.
The defendant is charged with planning genocide against non-Serbs in northwestern Bosnia in 1992 while he was vice president of the Bosnian Serb government.
Dodik served as prime minister of Republika Srpska from 1998 to 2001.
He is currently the chairman of the Independent Social Democrats Party.
Initially, he refused to testify before the UN tribunal, but prosecutors warned him that he could face up to seven years in prison and a stiff fine for contempt of court.

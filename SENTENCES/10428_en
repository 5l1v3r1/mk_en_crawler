THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Wednesday (20 October) urged the parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to adopt a constitutional amendment that would clear the way for establishment of a special war crimes court.
"Failure to pass these amendments would severely undermine the fight to hold war criminals accountable," she said in a joint statement with the top international officer in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, after the two met at the tribunal's headquarters in The Hague.
Parliament is to vote on the amendments Thursday.
In other news, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic said in an interview published Wednesday that the military is having problems destroying 30,000 tonnes of surplus weapons.
He complained that smelting the stockpiles would be harmful to the environment.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of journalists hit the streets of Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir and Antalya on Sunday (March 23rd) to protest the arrest of Ilhan Selcuk, the chief editor of the largest opposition newspaper in the country, the Cumhuriyet, and many other journalists. 
They are suspected of ties to the banned ultra-right nationalist movement Ergenekon, which authorities say had been preparing a military coup. 
But Cumhuriyet journalist Octay Akbal said at the rally that Selcuk's arrest has more to do with the lawsuit filed to ban the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which the newspaper has repeatedly accused of violating Turkey's secular principles. 
Participants in the rally have threatened to launch an information sector boycott.

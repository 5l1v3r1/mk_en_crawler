ANKARA, Turkey -- General Staff chief General Ilker Basbug on Tuesday (July 6th) called on Iraq to ratchet up pressure on members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in its north.
"The time has come and is passing for those responsible -- the people, institutions, states and formations in northern Iraq -- to do what is right," Basbug said in an interview with local Star TV.
The army confirmed on Tuesday that three soldiers and at least ten PKK personnel were killed during an attack on a military post in Hakkari province, near the Iraqi border.
Three soldiers were injured.
Military helicopters were dispatched to the area to support the troops.

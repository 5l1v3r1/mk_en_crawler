ATHENS, Greece -- Auditors from the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF on Thursday (June 17th) said they are satisfied with the implementation of the agreement with Greece required to activate a 110 billion-euro rescue package. 
The auditors, who spent a week in Greece inspecting key ministries and institutions, concluded that public spending is under control and the budget deficit is less than expected, while bank liquidity is sufficient. 
"The programme is on a good road and policies are being implemented as agreed," they said.

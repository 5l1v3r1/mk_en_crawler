SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb Defence Ministry has proposed trimming the size of the entity's army to make it compatible with NATO standards. 
A military spokesman told reporters on Thursday (28 August) that the force would be reduced from 6,600 to 4,000 men. 
He explained that the move was part of the government's efforts to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
The Republika Srpska government and parliament have not yet debated this issue.
In other news, SFOR spokesman Dale MacEachern said an operation earlier this week in and around Pale targeting fugitive political leader Radovan Karadzic had been successful. 
He said peacekeepers would carry out similar operations in the future.

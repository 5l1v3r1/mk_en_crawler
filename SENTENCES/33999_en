BAKU, Azerbaijan -- In an effort to reconcile feuding neighbours, Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannis Magriotis proposed on Sunday (2 November) that Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia start a dialogue on so-called "low impact" issues.
Sources say Armenia and Georgia have already approved the initiative.
Magriotis paid five-day visit to the several countries in the region where he discussed issues related to the Black Sea Co-operation Pact, as well as energy projects that would connect oil and gas-rich Caucasus regions with Greece and Europe.

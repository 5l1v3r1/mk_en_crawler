BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan met with UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in Belgrade on Wednesday (20 November), signalling the importance he attaches to the prosecution of war criminals.
Del Ponte said after the meeting that authorities are not doing enough to arrest former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
She said that the general still receives support from elements in the Yugoslav Army and moves freely in Belgrade and Serbia.
Yugoslav authorities say they are unaware of Mladic's whereabouts.
From Belgrade, Annan travelled to Croatia, where he told parliament that war crimes must not go unpunished.
Officials in Zagreb are wrestling with the extradition of wartime commander Gen Janko Bobetko.
While many Croats consider him a hero, prosecutors at The Hague have accused him of war crimes.

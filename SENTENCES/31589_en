BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb Parliament elected a new prime minister and cabinet late Friday (17 January). 
Dragan Mikerevic, 48, a moderate who once served as federal prime minister, will replace Mladen Ivanic as premier of the entity. 
Eight new members of the cabinet are Serbs, five are Muslims, and three are Croats, in line with constitutional amendments passed last year establishing a multiethnic government. 
Mikerevic says his government would focus on European integration and social and economic reform. 
He promised to lower unemployment and attract more foreign investment.

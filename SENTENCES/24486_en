BUCHAREST, Romania -- The final report by a parliamentary committee looking into the activities of Sports Minister Monica Iacob Ridzi recommended on Thursday (July 9th) she be investigated for abuse of office, and said she should resign.
Only members of her Liberal Democratic Party refused to vote in favour of the report.
According to the committee, Ridzi was not completely honest regarding allegations she spent money illegally through public companies.
Thus, the panel recommends that the Court of Accounts investigate contracts she signed.
Prime Minister Emil Boc has said he would dismiss any minister who is subject to an official investigation.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament requested on Thursday (May 19th) that EULEX and state prosecutors speed up their efforts to indict those who committed massacres during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo.
Lawmakers adopted a recommendation proposed by lawmaker Nait Hasani to accelerate the raising of a war crimes indictment.
One particular massacre at the Dubrava prison in 1999 was the topic of a long debate, after Hasani, who was a Dubrava prisoner at the time, expressed his frustration that no actions have been taken to shed light on this case.
A motion to raise a state indictment against Serbia failed because Kosovo is not a UN member.
Minority MPs did not attend the debate, opting instead to remain outside the assembly hall.

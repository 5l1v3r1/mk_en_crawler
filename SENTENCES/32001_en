SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN war crimes tribunal says it will complete indictments related to last year's military conflict in Macedonia by the end of 2003. 
UN tribunal deputy prosecutor Graham Blewitt, who visited Skopje on Friday (22 November), says additional funds must be allotted to complete the work and hire more staff. 
He also disclosed that the five cases over which the tribunal has decided to assume jurisdiction were actually incorporated into two investigations. 
The first deals with alleged war crimes committed by the former National Liberation Army; the second deals with war crimes allegedly committed by government forces.

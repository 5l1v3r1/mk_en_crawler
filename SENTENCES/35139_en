PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana told President Ibrahim Rugova on Tuesday (24 February) that the Union is committed to helping Pristina meet a set of standards established by the UN.
The eight standards, which must be met before any discussion of the province's final status can start, include rule of law, minority rights and economic reform.
Solana announced that the EU would provide 100m euros to help Pristina meet these standards.
"There's no time to lose.
As soon as the implementation of the plan begins, the better it will be for all," he said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece, along with the Netherlands, received new warnings from the European Commission (EC) on Thursday (February 28th) regarding restrictions of their gaming markets. 
EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy explained the EC warned Athens about restrictions that prevent sports betting companies that are lawfully licensed in another member state to enter Greece's gaming market. 
The EC gave Greece two months to make the necessary adjustments.
Separately, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude 5.0 on the Richter scale, hit southern Greece on Thursday. 
The epicentre was near the southern city of Kalamata. 
No injuries or damage was reported.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Wednesday (27 November), the EU mission in Sarajevo donated 2.6m euros to agencies working to clear mines left over from the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Michael Humphreys, the European Commission's representative in Sarajevo, said the money would be split mostly between the civil protection organisations in the country's two entities. 
The Union had already contributed more than 15m euros to mine-clearing efforts, but experts estimate only 10 per cent of the minefields have been cleared so far and 1.3 million landmines remain.

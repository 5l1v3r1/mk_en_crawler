TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Tuesday (November 18th) adopted a controversial bill on a new election code, with 112 of 140 lawmakers supporting it.
The ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) agreed to amend the election code back in April, but small parties in parliament protested their exclusion from election committees under the new code.
The SP welcomed the bill's adoption but said the government must complete other reforms for free and fair elections.
Meanwhile, a group of 12 opposition lawmakers decided to end their hunger strike after the vote.
They started their strike earlier this month to protest the proposed electoral changes.

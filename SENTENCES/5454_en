It is a story of hardship transcended through faith and energy, of strength found in the face of setbacks.
Julijana Zivanovic, one of Belgrade's few female cab drivers, is also a breast cancer survivor.
"I thought I was the strongest, toughest and healthiest, and then during a routine medical check up I found I had breast cancer.
I think I'm the only person in the world who didn't take any sick leave and continued to drive my cab 40 days after the surgery," she tells SETimes.

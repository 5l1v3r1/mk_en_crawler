ATHENS, Greece -- Unidentified assailants threw firebombs at the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki on Saturday (September 18th).
No one was injured in the attack.
The bombs were hurled by a group of 15 people who targeted a guard post outside the consulate.
"We consider this an attack against Greek police rather than against the consulate," the police said.
A similar incident happened on August 12th.

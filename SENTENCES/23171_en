PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Serbia and Montenegro on Wednesday (October 1st) started negotiations on a dual citizenship agreement, with Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic and his Montenegrin counterpart Jusuf Kalamperovic leading the negotiating delegations. 
On September 26th, Montenegro received a draft agreement on dual citizenship from Belgrade, based on Serbia's law on citizenship. 
Podgorica's proposal is based on Montenegro's immigration law, resulting in significant differences between the two documents. 
Montenegro intends to hold similar talks with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. 
According to Podgorica's proposal, dual citizenship will be an exception. 
Only those who had it before June 3rd 2006, when Montenegro declared independence, can retain it. 
Dual citizenship also will be available to those with a parent who is a citizen of another country.

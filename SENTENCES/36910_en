ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The government has decided to pull its remaining military observers out of northern Iraq, according to an announcement Sunday (4 July).
The observers were positioned in 1997 to oversee the truce between the two main Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdish Democratic Party.
The truce, brokered by Britain and the United States, has been successful and the observer mission is no longer needed, the government says.
In other news, two Turkish civilian contractors held hostage by Iraqi rebels were freed Friday after their firm agreed to stop working in Iraq.
The pair had been held just over a month.

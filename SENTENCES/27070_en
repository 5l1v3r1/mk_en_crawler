SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutor General Boris Velchev on Tuesday (November 3rd) filed an official request, asking that former Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev's immunity be lifted.
The prosecutor's office intends to press charges against Stanishev over the disappearance of confidential documents regarding national security, while Stanishev was prime minister.
Now a member of parliament, Stanishev has said he will give up his immunity voluntarily, which makes the parliamentary procedure only a formality.

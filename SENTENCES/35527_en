BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In separate statements on Monday (9 February), the European Commission and the OSCE Presence in Albania condemned a violent weekend demonstration in Tirana, warning that the protesters were undermining their own cause.
Participants in Saturday's rally, organised by opposition leader Sali Berisha, pelted the government building with stones and fought with police who tried to prevent them from storming the premises.
They were demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
Those wanting a change of government should "use the methods of democracy", said a spokeswoman for Chris Patten, the EU commissioner for external relations.
The head of the OSCE Presence in Albania, Osmo Lipponen, said that while the right to protest is guaranteed, this right also carried a number of responsibilities, including avoiding violence.

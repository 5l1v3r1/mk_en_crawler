SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Policy Jovan Manasievski discussed government priorities in 2004 at a public debate Saturday (20 December) in Skopje. 
He said the chief challenge would be complete implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord. 
He cited it as the main reason the government has decided to postpone the filing of an application for EU membership until February. 
That would allow the last stipulation of the accord -- the decentralisation law package -- to be approved. 
Manasievski said the second goal would be to drastically reduce the number of public sector employees, while stimulating the private sector to create new jobs.

OSIJEK, Croatia -- The trial against Antun Gudelj, charged with a triple murder at the start of the Croatian-Serbian war in July 1991, is expected to begin at the Osijek County Court in late September, local Judge Damir Krahulec announced on Monday (July 16th). 
Gudelj, who holds dual Croatian-Australian citizenship, was extradited from Australia to Croatia late last week. 
He is accused of killing a police chief and two of his aides that had been trying to mediate between Croats and Serbs in a bid to defuse tensions that eventually led to the armed conflict.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic on Friday (July 3rd) named Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor as a prime minister-designate, replacing Ivo Sanader, who resigned last week. 
Parliament is expected to approve the new government on Monday. 
Kosor will be Croatia's first woman prime minister since declaring independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
On Saturday, the ruling Croatian Democratic Union unanimously elected Kosor as its new leader at a party congress. 
The party made Sanader its honorary president.
Meanwhile, in an interview with the daily Jutarnji List, Sanader shed some light on his surprise decision to step down. 
He said it was partly in protest of the EU's "unacceptable behaviour" towards Croatia in its longstanding maritime border dispute with neighbouring Slovenia.

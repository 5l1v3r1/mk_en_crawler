BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's top war crimes prosecutor warned those helping Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic evade arrest that they have been identified and their movements are being monitored.

Local media described the statement as one of the strongest yet by an official in Belgrade.
Also Thursday, Serbian-Montenegro Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic met with Rasim Ljajic, Serbian-Montenegrin human and minority rights minister and chairman of the national council for war crimes co-operation.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- As expected, Slovenian officials voted against the closure Friday (July 24th) of the EU negotiations chapter on free movement for Croatian workers. 
Slovenia explained that some of the provisions pre-judged the longstanding maritime border dispute between the two countries. 
Slovenia blocked Croatia's EU accession talks late last year. 
Ongoing talks between the two sides over the last few months have failed to yield any results despite mediation by the European Commission. 
Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor is expected to meet with her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor soon to discuss the stalemate.

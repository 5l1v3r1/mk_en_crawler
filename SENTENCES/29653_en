SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Zlatko Lagumdzija, leader of the Social Democratic Party, which won the October 3rd general elections in the Federation of BiH, said on Sunday (January 30th) that he opposes the extradition of Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda to Serbia. 
Purda was detained earlier this month at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. 
The court of BiH scheduled hearings on Tuesday at which the prosecution and Purda's defence team will present their stances regarding Belgrade's extradition request. 
In an interview with Croatia's HTV, Lagumdzija also said that Croatian President Ivo Josipovic has brought new dynamics to regional dialogue.

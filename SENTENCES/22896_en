PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo Police Service (KPS) spokesperson Veton Elshani announced on Wednesday (November 5th) that authorities had found in Pristina a private clinic that specialised in transplanting human organs.
They arrested two doctors and the clinic's manager and are pursuing a third doctor, apparently from Turkey.
Elshani said they found the clinic after police questioned a Turkish national who claimed he came to Kosovo to receive treatment but had no money on him.
Subsequent medical exams revealed someone had removed his kidney, which investigators later determined went into an Israeli national.

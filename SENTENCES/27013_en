BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc signed two letters of intent Thursday (September 3rd), addressed to the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the first step in seeking a confidence vote on three bills. 
They include the single wage bill, the one regarding education system reform and one on the re-organisation of public authorities and institutions. 
Boc says the three measures are a start and others will continue the process of reform. 
They include the decentralisation of public administration, fiscal responsibility, reform of the pension system, and adoption of the criminal and civil inquiry codes.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the top international administrator in BiH, fired the entire board of Mostar's Elektroprivreda electricity supply company on Thursday (6 March), after an audit revealed corruption, mismanagement and funneling of money to the Croat nationalist HDZ party. 
"Ordinary citizens and small businesses who paid their electricity bills were in fact providing free electricity and kickbacks to the HDZ and their empire of a privileged elite," Ashdown said. 
In addition to ordering legislative changes to remove loopholes that allowed corruption to flourish, Ashdown ordered all firms that owe Elektroprivreda more than $5,000 to pay their bills immediately. 
He added that criminal charges would be filed against those involved in the scandal.

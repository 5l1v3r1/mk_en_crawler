ROME, Italy -- The Italian Senate ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Croatia and the EU on Thursday (24 July) and forwarded it to the House of Representatives for final approval.
Italy will become the 12th EU member country to ratify the accord, leaving only three members to go:
Belgium, Finland and Britain.
In other news, Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs assured his Romanian counterpart, Mircea Geoana, that Budapest fully supports Romania's bid for entry into the EU in 2007.
Hungary seemed to raise doubts about that earlier this week when it suggested that the ten countries expected to join in May should participate in accession talks with those further behind in the process.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Monday (25 August) that relations with neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) should not be affected by the recent dispute over Corridor Vc, a highway that will stretch from Budapest to Croatia's port of Ploce, via BiH.
Croatia has urged BiH to hold an international tender to find a contractor to build on BiH territory;
instead, the BiH government reportedly plans to give the contract to a BiH-Malaysian company, Bosmal, without a tender.
Several days ago, the Croatian government submitted a letter of intent for participation in the project, offering 7.65m euros to finance the cost of an international tender.
BiH officials reacted by accusing Croatia of trying to interfere in domestic affairs.

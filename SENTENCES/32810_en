PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Milorad Todorovic, the minister-co-ordinator in the Kosovo government, said Thursday (5 December) that he doubts the pace of returning Serbian refugees will increase next year.
Though authorities have already outlined a plan for returns, Todorovic says few expect it will actually be implemented.
He added that the several agencies associated with refugee returns only hinder progress.
On another note, a flooded airport runway forced NATO Secretary General George Robertson to scrap a scheduled visit to Kosovo on Thursday.
It will likely be rescheduled early next year.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested around 35 people Thursday (January 22nd), including a journalist and a trade union leader, on suspicion of membership in the Ergenekon organisation, which prosecutors say plotted a coup.
A senior police official and an army officer were among those brought in for questioning.
Police made arrests in 16 provinces throughout the country and also searched the offices of a metal industry trade union, local media reported.
The move followed a series of arrests earlier this month.
Separately Thursday, six people suffered injuries -- critical for one -- when a residential building collapsed in Ankara's Kecioren district.
Two floors of the building were affected, though many of the units were empty.
All of the injured were in an old building near the one that collapsed.
Investigators are working to determine what happened.

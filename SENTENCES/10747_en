SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- After a one-day postponement, the tripartite BiH presidency is expected to discuss the resignation of BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic at its Tuesday (9 November) session.
According to a statement Monday, debate was adjourned to allow consultations with the major parties.
Terzic submitted his resignation last week, citing parliament's failure to pass the government's version of the value-added tax law.
Terzic refused to comment on the issue Tuesday, saying only that if he is to stay, he needs solid support for reforms.

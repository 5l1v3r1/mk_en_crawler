ANKARA, Turkey -- Serdar Denktash, foreign minister of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", suggested on Thursday (13 May) that semi-official relations could be established between the Turkish and Greek Cypriot administrations. 
Denktash acknowledged that the EU is pressuring Turkey to recognise the Greek Cypriot state and that Turkey must take steps in that direction to bolster its bid to launch EU accession negotiations. 
He stressed, however, that the Greek Cypriot administration should be asked to recognise the existence of the Turkish administration on the other half of the island.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS) and G17 Plus have agreed on the priorities of the future Serbian government, following talks Monday (March 5th).
The priorities include continuation of diplomatic activities aimed at preserving Kosovo within Serbia's territory, the re-launch of the EU integration process, meeting remaining obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal, economic revival and combating crime and corruption.
Late last week, the DS held talks with the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS)-New Serbia (NS) coalition, while talks Tuesday will include the Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition and minorities' parties.

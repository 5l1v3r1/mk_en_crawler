BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The presidents of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Yugoslavia sent a joint letter to the EU on Monday (9 December) urging it not to forget about their aspirations for membership. 
"We express our expectation that the final documents of the Copenhagen Summit will contain a reference to the prospects for membership of our countries, as a strong message and impetus to continue on our way to EU integration," read the letter. 
The presidents further pledged to contribute to the fight against terrorism and organised crime and called on the EU to back their reform efforts.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Authorities have collected 40,000 rifles and guns under the weapon amnesty campaign, Serbian police reported Saturday (19 April). 
Police have also collected around 12,000 hand-held rocket launchers and about 2m pieces of ammunition, including grenades and various explosives. 
The government programme allows citizens to hand over illegally possessed weapons without prosecution. 
The campaign is a part of the security measures taken after the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
On Friday, acting Serbian President Natasa Micic said she expects the state of emergency will be lifted by the end of the month. 
The final decision will follow reports by government authorities on the effects of the anti-crime operations.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A powerful explosion damaged the offices of a Serbian bank in the southern part of Kosovo late Tuesday (January 1st). 
No one was injured in the incident, which took place in Dragas, near the border with Macedonia. 
The explosion targeted the only Serbian bank UNMIK allows to operate in the province.
In other news, former UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari predicted on Tuesday that the province's future will be decided within the first three months of 2008. 
He said he is not surprised the issue has been stalled in the UN Security Council, which failed months ago to reach an agreement.

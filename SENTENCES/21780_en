BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government on Thursday (July 24th) decided to return its ambassadors it had recalled from EU member states that recognised Kosovo.
The country will now regain representation at the ambassadorial level in all EU countries except Poland and Denmark, to which it still needs to appoint new ambassadors.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the return of the ambassadors will help Serbia's attempts to join the EU.
Opposition parties reject the move.
"It can be seen on a daily basis that the new government keeps succumbing to EU pressure and that it is not pursuing a policy in the best interests of Serbia," said Democratic Party of Serbia spokesman Andreja Mladenovic.

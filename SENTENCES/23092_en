PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government dismissed on Monday (June 2nd) any notion of establishing parallel municipal structures for Kosovo Serbs as a result of Serbia's May 11th local and parliamentary elections.
"Setting up parallel structures on the local level is inadmissible and unviable," Deputy Prime Minister Rame Manaj told parliament.
Lawmakers had asked for a firm stand against Serbia's plan.
Also Monday, Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi urged authorities in neighbouring Macedonia to invalidate Sunday's general elections because they were not free and democratic.
"Paramilitaries in uniform abused voting and stuffed ballot boxes," Krasniqi said.
He added that Kosovo's institutions are concerned by events in Macedonia because elections marred by violence and irregularities do not contribute to regional stability.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court is reviewing the law on marital status after regional courts complained about the wave of people potentially abusing the option of claiming Greek minority membership. 
Three courts -- in Saranda, Permet and Shkodra -- filed the complaint following this unusual demand by citizens to stress in their marital status that they belong to the Greek minority. 
These courts consider this a violation of the constitution, media reported on Tuesday (April 26th). 
In contrast, the government considers that nationality should remain part of the marital status declaration, arguing it is a means of preserving the national identity of Albanians. 
Declaring nationality has been included in the law since 2003. 
Thousands of citizens applied to change their marital status in exchange for personal benefits at the beginning of the year. 
This wave stopped when the courts stopped issuing new certificates until the Constitutional Court advises them on how to proceed.

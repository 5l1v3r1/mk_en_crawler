TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) walked out of another parliament session Thursday (October 28th), setting a number of conditions for their return.
Before leading the lawmakers out, the head of the SP parliamentary group, Gramoz Ruci, said the opposition wants the government to back off plans to demolish the Pyramid, a symbol built during communism.
He also requested an investigation into the recent killings of two SP officials, a probe of the 2009 elections, and a halt to procedures aimed at ending lawmakers' immunity from prosecution.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha downplayed the protest and insisted that the government will knock down the Pyramid and construct a parliamentary building in its place.
He said complaints about the June 2009 elections should be made to the proper institutions.

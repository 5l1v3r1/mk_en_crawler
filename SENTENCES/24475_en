ANKARA, Turkey --Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Tuesday (April 7th) Turkey and Armenia have achieved some progress in ongoing talks to normalise bilateral relations. 
At a press conference after the second forum of the Alliance of Civilisations in Istanbul, Babacan said "We are working on a comprehensive solution, and our talks are going well. 
We have made significant progress so far." Turkey and Armenia have no diplomatic relations, and their border has been closed for more than a decade. 
This is largely due to Turkey's support of Azerbaijan in the ongoing dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region and to Yerevan's effort to classify the killings of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917 as genocide. 
Last year, however, the two countries launched a normalisation process and stepped up official contacts.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Asen Asenov, director of Bulgaria's Customs Agency, confirmed on Wednesday (May 28th) that he and his two deputies have resigned. 
Asenov cited fatigue and personal reasons for the move, but media reports suggest Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev personally requested Asenov's resignation as part of an effort to restructure public administration and fight corruption. 
The press frequently attacks Asenov for reportedly allowing contraband. 
The prosecutor's office is expected to investigate him shortly.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Recent investigations prove local firms in Yugoslavia and Republika Srpska (RS) violated the UN embargo on military trade with Iraq, officials in Belgrade and Banja Luka confirmed. 
In Belgrade, a Yugoslav parliamentary commission acknowledged that state-run Jugoimport had breached UN resolutions. 
Newly-elected RS President Dragan Cavic, meanwhile, confirmed that the Orao military company had been illegally exporting weapons to Iraq via firms outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly Jugoimport. 
There were indications that Orao's business contacts with Iraq dated to 1999 and had been maintained with the knowledge of the former defence minister and army officials, said Cavic.

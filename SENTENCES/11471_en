SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Sergey Stanishev, leader of the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), said his party would not jeopardise Bulgaria's planned EU entry in 2007, if it takes power after next month's parliamentary elections.
Speaking on national television Friday (20 May), Stanishev said the BSP would not risk delaying EU membership through slower reforms or requesting revision of the decommissioning terms for Kozloduy nuclear power station's older units.

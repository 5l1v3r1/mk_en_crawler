ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic dismissed on Sunday (November 26th) the possibility of early elections in Croatia, stressing that the Croatian Democratic Union-led government enjoys a solid majority in parliament. 
Mesic's statement was in response to a recent call by the opposition Croatian Party of Rights' leader, Anto Djapic, for an early vote in spring 2007.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Extraordinary elections for mayor were held in the municipality of Suto Orizari, which is part of the Greater Skopje region, on Sunday (21 August).
The incumbent, Amdi Bajrami, has been jailed for embezzlement.
On Sunday, neither of the two candidates -- the Roma Union's Shaban Saliu and the United Party for Emancipation's Erdogan Iseini -- managed to obtain the needed majority -- 51 per cent of all cast votes -- so a second round will be held on 4 September.
Suto Orizari is the municipality with the largest Roma population in the country.

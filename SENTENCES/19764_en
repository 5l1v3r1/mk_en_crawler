LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Parliament has decided there will be no referendum on Croatia's bid to join the EU, Slovenian Parliament Speaker France Cukjati announced on Friday (January 18th).
The Slovenian National Party submitted a request for a referendum Thursday, in light of what its leader, Zmago Jelincic Plemeniti, described as "unilateral political moves, encroachment of Slovenian sovereignty and aggressive policies towards Slovenia".
Calls for a referendum circulated after Croatia decided to introduce a protected fishing zone in the Adriatic -- despite protests from Italy and Slovenia.
Though Slovenia is not going to hold a referendum, it might block Croatia's accession, according to senior Slovenian officials quoted by the Poslovni Dnevnik newspaper.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The five parties representing the Croat community in BiH -- the HDZ, HDZ-1990, HSP-Dapic-Jurisic, HSS and People's Party "Work for Betterment" -- endorsed a joint platform Friday (September 21st) for the country's new constitution.
The document vows compliance with EU principles and stipulates that the new constitution should guarantee the equality of all three constituent people.
The Croat parties want the current two-entity structure abandoned, replaced by a more functional constitutional order that will neither allow preferential treatment nor discrimination.
The document does not explicitly mention a separate Croat entity.
Negotiations on constitutional reform could begin next month.

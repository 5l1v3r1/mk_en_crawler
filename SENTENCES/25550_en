ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey gave Israel 50 days on Saturday (November 21st) to wrap up a long-delayed deal on the delivery of five drone aircraft for the army. 
The deal will be broken unless Israel observes the deadline, according to Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul. 
Talks continue, the minister added. 
Israeli officials have rejected speculations that there are political motives behind the delay of the delivery stating that the project is facing technical problems because the Turkish-made equipment turned out to be too heavy for the aircraft.

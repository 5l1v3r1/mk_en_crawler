NEW YORK, United States -- The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has adopted a three-year plan to root out the .yu domain name that was once set aside for Yugoslavia. 
ICANN assigned the top level internet domain names of .se and .me to Serbia and Montenegro after their breakup, but various entities in both countries have continued to use and even register new sites with the old .yu domain name. 
Montenegro will manage the .me domain, while the new Serbian National Register of Internet Domain Names will take over the .rs domain.

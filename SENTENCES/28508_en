STRASBOURG, France -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki voiced expectations Tuesday (May 11th) that his country will get a specific date for accession talks before Spain's term as EU president ends in late June.
He added that the first negotiation chapter could be opened during Poland's term as EU president in the second half of next year.
Milososki was in Strasbourg, attending a ceremony to mark Macedonia assuming the chairmanship of the Council of Europe's (CoE) Committee of Ministers, calling it a "historic day for our country".
Macedonia's three main priorities during the six-month chairmanship will be strengthening human rights protections, fostering integration while respecting diversity and promoting youth participation.

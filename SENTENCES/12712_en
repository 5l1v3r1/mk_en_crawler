SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown on Tuesday (5 April) travels to Brussels, where he will spend the next several days meeting with senior EU and NATO officials about recent developments in BiH, ahead of a crucial assessment period.
Later this month NATO will consider BiH's progress in meeting the criteria for entry in the Partnership for Peace programme, while next month a European Commission delegation will be assessing the country's preparedness for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Also Monday, the head of the EU Police Mission in BiH, Kevin Carty, again urged the implementation of crucial police reform.
In a statement, Carty said reform poses no threat to entities, only to criminals.

TIRANA, Albania -- Local media reported on Monday (January 7th) that Albania plans to cut its armed forces by 3% by 2013.
Sources say the number of troops will be reduced by 2% and the rest of the cutbacks will involve civilians working in the army.
The country's two main goals are to receive an invitation to NATO membership during the April summit in Bucharest and to professionalise its army by 2010.
In other news Monday, opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama told a press conference that the SP will submit a draft resolution to parliament expressing its determination to accomplish the initiatives necessary for Albania to join NATO.
Rama said this resolution is a prerequisite for overcoming the chronic political conflict between the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition.

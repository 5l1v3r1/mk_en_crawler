TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Tuesday (9 November) rejected a lawmaker's charges that he was involved in arms trafficking to Kosovo.
Nikoll Lesi, an opposition lawmaker and editor-in-chief of the daily Koha Jone, presented to parliament a transcript of what he claimed was a conversation between Nano and former Constitutional Court chairman Fehmi Abdiu in which the two discussed the possibility of smuggling arms into Kosovo in 1997.
A government spokesman said Nano has asked for an investigation into the matter.
He accused Lesi of undermining Albania's relations with other countries.

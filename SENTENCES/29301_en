TIRANA, Albania -- A contingent of ten Albanian soldiers trained as mine-clearers headed to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Monday (October 4th), to help locate and destroy remaining ordnance from the 1990s conflict.
"You are part of the 6th contingent that will help, as a NATO member, a friendly country that cannot walk safe on its land," Deputy Defence Minister Arjan Starova said at the departure ceremony.
The first Albanian contingent within the ALTHEA mission in BiH started operating in April 2008, 12 years after the first Albanian troops were sent to the country.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu again urged the major political parties Monday (May 21st) to stop squabbling and start focusing on reforms that would ensure democratic stability and progress in Euro-Atlantic membership bids. 
Moisiu particularly criticised the politicians for arguing over whether the ruling Democratic Party's Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli could become acting president when Moisiu's mandate ends on July 24th. 
Choosing to co-operate, he said, would lead to the selection of a consensus candidate to succeed him.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The trial against ten people suspected of organising an international prostitution network on one the world's biggest yachts kicked off in Antalya on Monday (December 20th). 
The Savarona, a 38,000 euro-a-night yacht, was used by the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, before his death in 1938. 
Turkish authorities deported nine Russian and Ukrainian women, including two minors, after the prostitution network was busted in late September. 
Kazakh businessman Tevfik Arif, a main suspect in the trial, is accused of organising the whole network of prostitutes, mediators and the transfer of foreigners to the yacht. 
He rejected all charges against him Monday, calling them "figments of the imagination".

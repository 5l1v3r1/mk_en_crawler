ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz kicks off a visit to Zagreb on Wednesday (May 4th) to discuss Croatia's co-operation with the court ahead of Brammertz's report on co-operation by former Yugoslav countries. 
He presents it to the UN Security Council next month.
Croatian war veterans will stage a demonstration in Zagreb during the visit to protest last month's ICTY verdicts against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac. 
The tribunal convicted the two of war crimes stemming from the 1995 military operation Storm and sentenced them to 24 and 18 years in prison respectively.

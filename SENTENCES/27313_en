PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Authorities expect additional questions from the European Commission by the end of March, European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic told members of parliament's European integration committee Friday (February 26th).
Djurovic said that more EU missions are expected to visit the country soon.
Montenegro delivered its responses to the EC membership questionnaire in December.
Based on answers to more than 2,100 questions -- along with more to come -- the EU will assess Podgorica's readiness for membership.
Montenegro hopes to obtain candidate status by the end of 2010 and launch accession talks early in 2011.

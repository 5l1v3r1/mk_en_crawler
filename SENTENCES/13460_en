SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said on Thursday (22 December) that he is still not a pessimist when in comes to BiH political leaders agreeing on the restructuring of the presidency.
Though local politicians failed to reach a consensus after 14 hours of talks, McElhaney said he does not consider the latest round of negotiations a failure.
He reiterated, however, that Washington views one president -- rather than the current tripartite structure -- as the optimal solution.
In other news, the Federation of BiH House of Peoples adopted the 2006 budget on Thursday, a day after it was adopted by the lower house.
Since the versions vary, a joint committee will work to reconcile the language.
The Republika Srspka government announced it has adopted a revised draft budget for 2006 -- increasing total expenditures -- and is forwarding it to parliament for approval.

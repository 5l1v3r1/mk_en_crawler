SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A European Parliament (EP) delegation met on Thursday (February 18th) with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Deputy Prime Minister Vasko Naumovski. 
The delegation said afterward that Gruevski is committed to resolving the long-standing name dispute with Greece. 
EP lawmaker Zoran Thaler called for consensus between the government and the opposition regarding the issue. 
The EP delegation warned that if Skopje and Athens fail to find a solution by June, it could hurt both Macedonia and the region.

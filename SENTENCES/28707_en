BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) is starting talks Monday (September 13th) with other opposition parties aimed ultimately at early elections. 
The SNS plans talks with New Serbia and with the Socialist movement led by Aleksandar Vulin. 
SNS official Nikola Selakovic blames the government for failing to meet its promises and for the current economy. 
New Serbia leader Velimir Ilic voiced expectation that the Democratic Party of Serbia will also join the talks. 
Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic responded by saying it is natural for the opposition to seek snap elections, but he ruled them out. 
Serbia's next scheduled general elections are in 2012.

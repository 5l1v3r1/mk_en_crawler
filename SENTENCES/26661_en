BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Glas javnosti editor-in-chief Slavoljub Kacarevic was released from custody Monday (November 9th) after a Belgrade judge interrogated three witnesses. 
Ivana Ramic, spokesperson for the Belgrade District Court, noted the detention was aimed at preventing Kacarevic from influencing witnesses in the investigation into alleged abuse of power, eight years ago. 
Kacarevic was arrested on October 28th along with Radisav Rodic, owner of the daily newspaper Glas javnosti and the tabloid Kurir. 
Rodic will remain in custody pending his interrogation later this month for alleged tax evasion.

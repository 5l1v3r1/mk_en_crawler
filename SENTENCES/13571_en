The document was signed by Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who was visiting Tirana as part of a regional tour.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said he is confident that the SAA would create a climate for co-operation among political parties and encourage implementation of democratic reforms.

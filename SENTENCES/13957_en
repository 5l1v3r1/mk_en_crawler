SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Officials from BiH and Serbia-Montenegro signed a protocol Thursday (15 December) on bilateral co-operation in EU integration efforts.
The focus would be stepped up exchanges of experience gathered during the process.
Also Thursday, the BiH Council of Ministers approved a bill on temporary measures --such as freezing assets -- that can be taken against those indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, as well as those suspected of aiding them.
The proposal will be sent to parliament with a fast track approach.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government and the opposition still show no sign of consensus in ending the political stalemate that has gripped the country for months. 
A parliamentary session on the June 2009 elections started on Thursday (March 18th) and ended after midnight, but failed -- despite high expectations from the international community -- to produce results. 
The government proposes establishing a parliamentary commission to investigate the elections while the opposition Socialist Party insists on actually opening the ballot boxes where irregularities were reported. 
The session is expected to continue Friday.

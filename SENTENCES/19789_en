ATHENS, Greece -- The UN's special envoy in the name dispute between Greece and Macedonia offered a new proposal Tuesday (February 19th) to resolve the long-standing issue.
"This proposal does not fully satisfy both sides, but it is just and dignified," envoy Matthew Nimetz said after another round of talks, held in Athens.
Details of his proposal -- which analysts have said could be his last -- were not revealed.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said after the hour-long talks, attended by Macedonian representative Nikola Dimitrov and Greece's Adamantios Vassilakis, that "the time has come to resolve this problem once and for all.
The negotiating process is at the crossroads today." Another meeting is expected in two weeks or so.
Meanwhile, about 3,000 Macedonian students gathered in downtown Skopje to protest possible changes in their country's name.
The rally, organised by the NGO "Youth Know", took place amid a strong police presence.
Some demonstrators gathered in front of the Greek Embassy and threw stones, though no major damage was reported.

NEW YORK, United States -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier went before the UN Security Council on Wednesday (February 16th), to present Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's quarterly report on Kosovo, which concluded that the last three months have been characterised by political insecurity and uncertainty. 
Zannier noted that politicians are in the process of forming a government, and joined the chorus of voices calling for a new government with clean hands. 
As for Council of Europe rapporteur Dick Marty's report, alleging human organ trafficking and other crimes, Zannier said a comprehensive investigation is necessary. 
He also urged Marty to submit any evidence to EULEX.

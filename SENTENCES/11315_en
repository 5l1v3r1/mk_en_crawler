SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In an interview with the newspaper Trud published Thursday (23 June), President Georgi Parvanov vowed to initiate talks aimed at establishing a new government as soon as possible after parliamentary elections Saturday. 
He confirmed he would convoke the new parliament immediately, rather than waiting for the 30-day constitutional deadline to expire. 
Some analysts doubt that negotiations on a coalition cabinet will go smoothly.
In other news, Bulgarian National Radio has announced that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe will send observers to monitor Saturday's vote. 
They are being deployed at the foreign ministry's request.

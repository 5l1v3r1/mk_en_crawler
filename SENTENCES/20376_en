DAKAR, Senegal -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad proposed on Thursday (March 13th) a joint offensive involving Turkey, Iran and Iraq against members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Speaking at the summit of the Islamic Conference in Senegal's capital, Dakar, Ahmadinejad said that only if the three countries join efforts can they could resolve the PKK problem.
Iran reportedly tightened border security with Iraq after Turkey launched a brief air and ground operation against the PKK last month, in order to prevent PKK guerillas from fleeing into Iran.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko on Tuesday (June 15th) urged Bosnian lawmakers to adopt a law on population census. 
He called for a compromise so that the headcount could be conducted next year. 
The House of Representatives is to start discussing the census draft on Wednesday. 
According to the bill, Bosnian citizens would be able to declare their ethnic and religious background, or their language, if they want.

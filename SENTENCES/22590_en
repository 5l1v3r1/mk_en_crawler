PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Officials in Pristina appealed once again to all displaced persons, especially from the Serb community, to return to their homes in Kosovo. 
"Kosovo has had a bitter past, but this cannot stop us from building a future together," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said at a ceremony launching a project on returns and re-integration Tuesday (November 11th). 
International partners in the project, the European Commission and the UNDP office in Kosovo, also pledged to assist in its implementation. 
The project will cost 6m euros and span 21 months.

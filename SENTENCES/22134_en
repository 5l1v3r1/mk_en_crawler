BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Saturday (July 19th) that he protested to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon over the initiation of UNMIK's reconfiguration without Belgrade's consent at a meeting Friday.
If the reconfiguration is necessary at all, then Belgrade must be part of those negotiations, he said.
Jeremic announced that he will invite UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier to visit Belgrade next week.
The Serbian diplomat suggested a new round of talks between Serbia and the UN aimed at reaching an agreement on the international presence in Kosovo.
Belgrade will not change its position on Kosovo in order to join the EU, Jeremic said in an interview with Interfax news agency Saturday.

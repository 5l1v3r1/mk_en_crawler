PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Montenegrin special prosecutor for organised crime, Stojanka Radovic, launched an investigation at the weekend against two Russian nationals, Sergei Ilin and Josif Karmah, for suspected money laundering. 
They were arrested at the Podgorica airport last week during an alleged attempt to fly out with 797,350 euros, whose origin they could not prove. 
The two remain in custody.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) approved resolutions Thursday (March 12th) on the progress of Turkey, Croatia and Macedonia in preparing for their EU membership.
Lawmakers urged Turkey to speed up reforms and expressed concern over the polarisation of both society and the main political parties.
The resolution supported the trial of the shadowy Ergenekon organisation and encouraged further investigation.
But it expressed concern over reports of poor treatment of the suspects and urged the court to conduct fair trials.
The document also expressed concern on shortcomings pertaining to freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Regarding Croatia, EP lawmakers said any European Commission (EC) mediation in resolving the country's border dispute with Slovenia should be based on international law.
The report noted an unofficial agreement Slovenia and Croatia struck in August 2007 to take their dispute before The Hague-based International Court of Justice.
At the same time, the EP welcomed the determination of both countries to accept EC mediation.
Concerning Macedonia, the EP recommended that the country receive a date for launching EU accession talks by the end of this year, as well as full liberalisation of its visa regime with the bloc, in light of progress in introducing biometric passports and fighting human trafficking and illegal immigration.
The document also praised the progress Macedonia has made in applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
Also Thursday, the EP demanded an extension of the mandate of The Hague war crimes tribunal by at least two more years beyond its planned 2011 closure date.

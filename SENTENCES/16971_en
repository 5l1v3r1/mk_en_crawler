SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Libyan embassy in Sofia sent a note to the foreign ministry Wednesday (3 May) protesting the publication of cartoons depicting Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi in the Sofia newspaper Novinar. 
The embassy described the cartoons as insulting and not serving the interests of the two countries' peoples. 
Later Wednesday, Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry expressed concern over the issue, noting it comes at "a very delicate moment" in bilateral relations. 
The cartoons featured Qadhafi and the Libyan judicial system in relation to the trial against Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death for a HIV/AIDS infection scandal in Libya. 
A new trial begins next week.

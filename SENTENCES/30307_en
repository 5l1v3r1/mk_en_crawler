TIRANA, Albania -- The final results of the May 8th local elections will be published by the end of this week, the Central Election Commission announced on Sunday (May 15th). 
The race is especially tight in Tirana, where ruling Democratic Party candidate Lulzim Basha is neck and neck with incumbent mayor Edi Rama, head of the opposition Socialist Party. 
Rama says he won by only ten votes after about 250,000 votes were counted. 
The last boxes were counted under the close observation of foreign ambassadors.

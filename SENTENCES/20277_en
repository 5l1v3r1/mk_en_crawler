TIRANA, Albania -- Small parties from both sides of the political spectrum in Albania voiced their opposition Tuesday (February 12th) to electoral reforms presented by the two biggest parties, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP). 
At a meeting on Tuesday, representatives of the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Alliance Party, the Socialist Movement for Integration, the Demo-Christian Party, and the Republican Party said they were being excluded by the big parties. 
The issue came to a head after SP Edi Rama rejected a request by his party's smaller allies for open lists; that is, the order in which their names appear on ballots. 
The parties are now threatening to veto proposals within the electoral reform committee. 
The reforms are key to Albania's Euro-Atlantic bids.

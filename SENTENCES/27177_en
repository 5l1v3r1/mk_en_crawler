ANKARA, Turkey -- Deniz Baykal, leader of the opposition People's Republican Party (CHP), said on Wednesday (March 3rd) that if parliament passes the proposed new judicial reforms, his party will appeal them before the Constitutional Court. 
Amending the constitution is a key requirement in EU accession talks. 
Late last month, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that his Justice and Development Party (AKP) government is working on a package of amendments and said they would be put to a referendum if necessary. 
Parliament can amend the constitution if the proposal is backed by 367 of 550 lawmakers. 
If it gets at least 330 votes, it can be put to a referendum. 
The CHP has repeatedly gone to the Constitutional Court on various issues over the course of the AKP's rule.

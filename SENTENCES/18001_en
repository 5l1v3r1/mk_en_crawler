SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A joint US-Bulgarian aviation exercise began on Monday (March 19th) at Bezmer Airbase in Bulgaria, near the border with Turkey.
The ten-day drill aims to train pilots for participation in humanitarian relief missions.
US medical personnel, the 37th Airlift Squadron of the US Air Force in Europe and members of the Bulgarian Air Force are participating in the exercise that will simulate responses to both manmade and natural disasters.
The joint exercises are part of the agreement to establish US military bases in Bulgaria, sealed last year.

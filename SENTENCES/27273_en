PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the Serbian National Council (SNC) for central Kosovo, Rada Trajkovic, was dismissed from the political organisation Tuesday (December 1st), apparently because he had urged Kosovo Serbs to participate in the November 15th local elections. 
Two more members of the Council were dismissed as well. 
The SNC is a parallel structure to the official institutions in Kosovo and is managed by Belgrade.

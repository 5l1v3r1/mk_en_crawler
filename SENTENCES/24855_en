PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Thursday (July 2nd) he is not concerned about the relatively low number of countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence, or that none have in more than a month.
"We cannot set the itineraries or the movements of states on decisions that they have to take," Sejdiu explained.
"I never want to compare the developments with histories of other states ...
however, I know that some countries from the former Yugoslavia had to wait up to six months for their first recognition," he added.

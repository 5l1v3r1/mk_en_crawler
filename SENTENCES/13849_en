SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided on Thursday (18 August) to establish an advisory body for combating money laundering and terrorism financing.
A government press release stressed that the launch of the new structure is in line with the national strategy in this field and seeks to harmonise the domestic effort with international laws and standards.
Also Thursday, President Branko Crvenkovski explicitly rejected the possibility of bilingualism in the Macedonian Army or police communications, as recently suggested by the Democratic Union for Integration.
Crvenkovski noted that the use of Albanian in the army was not stipulated in the Ohrid Peace Accords, adding that this "omission" was no accident.

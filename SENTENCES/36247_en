ANKARA, Turkey -- European Parliament President Pat Cox praised the Turkish government Tuesday (2 March) for adopting reforms, but cautioned that they "must not remain on paper -- they must be put into action". 
Cox pledged that the EU would be fair in assessing Turkey's progress in meeting membership criteria.
In Istanbul Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said his government considers the steps taken by Turkey towards EU membership as very positive. 
He confirmed London's support for Turkey's bid to join the Union. 
Straw was in Istanbul to attend a commemoration ceremony for the victims of last year's terrorist attacks there.

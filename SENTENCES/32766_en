BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbia's election commission confirmed on Tuesday (10 December) that voter turnout during Sunday's presidential election was just 45 per cent, invalidating the results yet again.
Democratic Party of Serbia candidate Vojislav Kostunica won the majority of votes - 58 per cent, compared to 36 per cent for Vojislav Seselj of the Serbian Radical Party and 4 per cent for Borislav Pelevic of the Serbian Unity Party.
Kostunica appealed the outcome to both the election commission and the Supreme Court, insisting voter registration numbers are inflated, but lost on both counts.

PODGORICA, Montenegro/BELGRADE, Serbia -- Montenegrin authorities have not yet received any request from Kosovo regarding its properties in former Yugoslav republics, the foreign ministry announced on Tuesday (April 26th).
The Kosovo daily Koha Ditore reported on Monday that the foreign ministry and the Privatisation Agency of Kosovo have established a commission and identified Kosovo's property abroad, including 172 properties of former social enterprises, most of them in Serbia.
The Foreign Ministry in Pristina has said that the reclaiming process will begin with 42 properties in Montenegro.
Meanwhile, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said that Kosovo cannot reclaim property because it was not a republic within the former Yugoslavia and is not recognised by Serbia as an independent state.

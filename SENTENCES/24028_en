HELSINKI, Finland -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met on Wednesday (June 17th) with Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb in Helsinki. 
Afterwards, Talat told reporters that a comprehensive reunification solution should be found as soon as possible, making a united Cyprus a full member of the EU. 
"This is our final target," Talat said. 
He called for speedier talks, so an agreement could be reached before elections in the Turkish part of the divided island next year.

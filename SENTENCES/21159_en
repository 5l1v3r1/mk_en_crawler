ANKARA, Turkey -- Human error likely caused Friday's air crash in Turkey that killed all 56 people onboard an AtlasJet airplane, the daily Zaman reported on Sunday (December 2nd).
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the pilot tried to alter the route to shave five minutes off the flight time.
After diverting from the given trajectory, the plane crashed into a mountain ridge.
Investigators reportedly also found that the pilot failed to use the special VOR landing device.
The MD 83 was bound from Istanbul to Isparta when it disappeared from radar screens moments before landing.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two Belgrade newspapers, Glas javnosti and Blic, separately reported on Wednesday (18 January) that war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic is hiding in Russia. 
According to Glas javnosti, Mladic has been in Russia since May 2005. 
Both publications say Serbian authorities have been secretly negotiating the former Bosnian Serb military commander's surrender since December. 
However, authorities continue to insist publicly that Mladic's whereabouts are unknown.
In other news, a Republika Srpska (RS) police spokesman announced that RS special police troops launched an operation Wednesday morning to capture war crimes indictees in the region of Zepa. 
He added that police were searching houses and other locations on the basis of a tip.

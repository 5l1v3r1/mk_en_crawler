SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Regional co-operation in energy, infrastructure and environmental protection was the focus of a visit by Greek Development Minister Apostolos Tsohatzopoulos to Skopje on Monday (5 May). 
During talks with President Boris Trajkovski and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, Tsohatzopoulos said his country was willing to intensify bilateral co-operation, particularly in the fields of natural gas and electricity transit and transmission, as well as protection of the Prespa and Dojran lakes. 
He also for the first time said officially that Greece might accept certain changes in the status of the Greek-owned Okta oil refinery near Skopje, suspending its privileges over imports of oil derivatives in Macedonia. 
The issue has been the subject of arguments for months as well as criticism from the European Commission, which claims Okta's monopoly contradicts Macedonia's interim trade agreement with the EU.

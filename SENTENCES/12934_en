THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic told reporters Monday (2 May) that he wants NATO to help overhaul his country's security services. 
The minister said this could happen if Belgrade is admitted quickly into the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme. 
Draskovic went on to add that once it gets closer to NATO, Serbia-Montenegro would be better equipped to meet its obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal. 
But NATO spokesman James Appathurai said Belgrade must first prove it is co-operating sufficiently with the UN court. 
Draskovic made a daylong visit to the Netherlands for talks with Dutch counterpart Bernard Bot.

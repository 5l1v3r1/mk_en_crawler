BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania plans to sell its last 18 Soviet MiG-29 fighter aircraft and replace them with Western-made planes, the air force chief of staff said Tuesday (20 July). 
Gheorghe Catrina said the defence ministry had decided it would be more profitable to sell off the warplanes, rather than to try and modernise them. 
The MiGs were decommissioned two years ago. 
He announced plans to acquire 48 aircraft between 2008 and 2012 to replace the current fleet of 100 upgraded MiG-21s. 
The country also intends to buy four Hercules C-130 heavy-duty and nine medium-haul transport aircraft as well as 12 helicopters and six ground-to-air missile systems. 
The move is seen as part of Romania's rearmament programme following its accession to NATO earlier this year.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court ruled on Wednesday (December 12th) that some articles in the government's bill on the majority voting system are unconstitutional. 
President Traian Basescu appealed the bill to the court last month, saying it was incomplete. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu maintains that the appeal was the only means Basescu had to block the measure.

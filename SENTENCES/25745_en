THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors on Tuesday (January 19th) insisted that the sentence of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Army General Rasim Delic be more than doubled, from three to seven years in prison.
During the appeals hearing, Delic's lawyers argued that the current sentence conforms to his level of responsibility in the atrocities.
In September 2008, the tribunal sentenced him for failing to prevent war crimes against Serb prisoners committed by a mujahedeen unit under his command during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

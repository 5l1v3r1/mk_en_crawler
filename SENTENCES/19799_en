SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Rumen Petkov signed the first co-operation agreement under the European Commission's (EC) "Prevention and Fight Against Crime" programme for the period 2007-2010 on Tuesday (August 21st).
BTA quotes ministry sources as saying the programme aims to build partnership among EU member states and develop common strategies against crime, while boosting security.
In other news Tuesday, Trud reported that draft documents on the new national security agency are complete and will be submitted to parliament in early September.
The project, initiated by Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, incorporates the functions of the National Security Service from the interior ministry, the Military Counterintelligence Service from the defence ministry, and the Financial Investigations Bureau from the finance ministry.
By streamlining the process, redundancies and overwhelming paperwork- related delays could be avoided.

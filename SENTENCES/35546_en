SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The newspaper <I>Vecer</I> reports that Macedonia plans to reduce the number of army general staff from 14 to seven, as part of the Strategic Defence Review. 
The document also envisions that the chief of the general staff will be a political figure, whereas the joint command will decide on operational matters. 
The number of defence ministry departments would be reduced, as well. 
The ministry would appoint three to five advisers to consult on reforms and on improving co-operation with NATO. 
As evidence of that effort, parliament on Friday (6 February) ratified a draft resolution to increase the number of Macedonian peacekeepers assigned to the international force in Afghanistan.

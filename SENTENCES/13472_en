SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Two cases involving patients with bird flu-like symptoms have been reported by local media in Bulgaria.
A woman died Sunday (19 February) in Plovdiv, while a 32-year-old man in the southern town of Haskovo has been hospitalised after contact with dead fowl.
Authorities said initial tests in the Plovdiv case had not shown the presence of the deadly H5N1 virus strain, but further testing is under way.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil paid a visit Sunday to areas in northern Bulgaria where the first cases of bird flu surfaced in wild fowl.
They met with regional veterinary authorities to discuss measures taken to contain the disease.
In neighbouring Romania, authorities announced Sunday that the H5N1 strain was detected in birds in two Black Sea towns, Tuzla and Navodari.
That makes 33 areas where it has been identified.

ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou says the government will unveil a bill this week aimed at restructuring the public sector and limiting the budget crisis. 
In an interview with Ethnos on Sunday (February 7th), Papaconstantinou said "there is waste of money everywhere," in the public sector, adding that the legislation is also aimed at tax evasion, another serious problem in Greece. 
Exemptions and other relief for some categories of tax payers will end, Papaconstantinou added.

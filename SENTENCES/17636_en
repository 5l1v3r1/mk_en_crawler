ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraqi Vice President Tarik al-Hashimi visited Ankara on Tuesday (March 27th) and urged both Turkey and Iraq to respect their common border. 
He went on to warn Turkey against possible attacks on separatist Kurdish guerrillas in northern Iraq, stressing instead that the two neighbours should be united and co-ordinated when dealing with the problem. 
Al-Hashimi also promised that his country would take measures to prevent members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party in Iraq from staging attacks on Turkey. 
Al-Hashimi met with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
In other news Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett cut short her visit to Turkey, returning to London on account of an unrelated situation -- the detention of 15 British sailors and marines in Iran. 
Before she left, she reportedly asked Turkey to use its influence in the region to help Britain negotiate with Tehran. 
She also assured officials of Britain's continued support for Turkey's EU aspirations.

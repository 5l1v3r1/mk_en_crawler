TIRANA, Albania -- Police in Saranda arrested a former police officer Saturday (August 22nd) who is suspected of forging 26 different stamps and seals of public institutions.
Investigators say Selman Lumani, 55, now a taxi driver, has been stamping documents in the name of the foreign ministry, interior ministry, education ministry and other institutions, as well as Greek offices in Albania and various institutions in Greece.
Trying to avoid arrest, he jumped from the window of his third-floor apartment and ended up in critical condition.

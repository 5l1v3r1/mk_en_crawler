TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi met with Energy Minister Dritan Prifti and other officials and experts Monday (January 11th) to discuss the situation in the flood-battered northwest.
Prifti said the situation is improving as water levels return to normal.
Experts suggest that Macedonia hold back more water in Lake Ohrid to reduce the amount currently flowing into the Drini River.

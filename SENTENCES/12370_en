BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The advocate general of the European Court of Justice announced Tuesday (10 May) that in his opinion the name of feta cheese is a typical Greek name and deserves legal protection.
Germany and Denmark are suing the EU over the right to use the name of the popular white cheese, arguing that the name is associated with a process rather than with Greece as a country of origin.
The dispute over feta has been raging for nearly 16 years.
The full court will announced its ruling on the case within several months.

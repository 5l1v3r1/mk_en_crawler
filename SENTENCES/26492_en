ZAGREB, Croatia -- During his first press conference Monday (January 11th), President-elect Ivo Josipovic vowed to fight corruption, warning that graft is blocking reforms needed to accelerate the country's EU integration process.
He said he wants to forge closer co-operation with neighbouring countries.
Josipovic, of the main opposition Social Democrat Party, easily won the election Sunday, beating Zagreb Mayor Milan Bandic in a run-off.
In other news Monday, the Supreme Court upheld a seven-year prison sentence given to former General Vladimir Zagorec for abuse of office and embezzling nearly 4m euros worth of diamonds.
Zagorec's lawyer said he would appeal to the Constitutional Court and to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, if necessary.
Prosecutors say that when Zagorec stepped down as deputy defence minister in 2000, he embezzled diamonds left in 1993 by a German trader as collateral in an illegal weapons deal.

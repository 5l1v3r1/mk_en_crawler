BELGRADE, Serbia -- All Serbian citizens under 18 years of age can receive Greek visas for free, Greek Ambassador to Belgrade Christos Panagopoulos announced on Saturday (June 7th). 
Serb citizens applying for group visas can also receive them for free. 
"Practically, Greece is the first country to launch this initiative among the 17 EU members who agreed on it on May 6th in Paris," Panagopoulos said. 
However, not all Serbs entitled to free visas will receive them, since all applications will undergo a review.

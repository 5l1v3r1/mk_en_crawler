BRUSSELS, Belgium - The EU on Monday (December 8th) called on Turkey to urgently normalise relations with member state Cyprus. 
At a meeting in Brussels, the EU foreign ministers expressed regret that Turkey has not yet implemented the Ankara Protocol, which expands the Turkey-EU customs union to include Cyprus. 
It would mean opening Turkish airports and ports to Greek Cypriot planes and ships. 
"Progress is now awaited as a matter of urgency," the ministers said in a joint statement. 
They also said they expect Turkey to actively support ongoing talks aimed at reunifying divided Cyprus. 
Regarding Turkey's EU accession process, the ministers called on Ankara to step up political reforms, pursue judicial reform and establish an anti-corruption strategy.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- New Defence Minister Boris Tadic told a local TV station on Saturday (5 April) that the government is determined to find Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic and send him to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
He said, however, that he was not aware of any elements of the military protecting the general.
UN prosecutors have insisted that the army has helped Mladic avoid arrest.
On Friday, the central government in Belgrade approved an amendment to the law on co-operation, allowing the extradition of individuals indicted after April 2002.
In other news Saturday, Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said there is a probable connection between the murder of Zoran Djindjic and the prosecution of war crime suspects.
He told the Beta news agency that most of the individuals accused of the conspiracy were involved in atrocities during the wars of the 1990s.
Among the latest arrests was Borislav Mikelic, who served briefly as prime minister of the Serb entity in Croatia during the 1991-1995 war.
One of Slobodan Milosevic closest aides, Mikelic is suspected of links to the Zemun clan, which allegedly orchestrated Djindjic's assassination last month.
Meanwhile, Serbian police issued arrest warrants for Milosevic's wife and son.
Mira Markovic is wanted in connection with the 2000 murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic.
Marko Milosevic is believed to have been in Russia since his immunity from prosecution expired in March.

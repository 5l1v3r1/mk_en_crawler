BELGRADE, Serbia -- A witness in the trial of a group of people suspected of helping Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic evade justice told the court on Tuesday (November 28th) that at least 500 senior officials and officers from the security services knew where Mladic was hiding.
Srboljub Nikolic, a retired Yugoslav Army colonel, said Serbia's politicians knew that the fugitive lived at an army barracks until May 2002, when military officers evacuated him.
One of those allegedly familiar with the move from the Topcider facility was Aco Tomic, then chief of the country's military intelligence service and a current aide to Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- High-ranking officials of the judicial systems in Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro completed a two-day conference in Belgrade Saturday (24 May). 
The magistrates discussed compliance of national laws with internal legislation and standards. 
The Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Fund, the Croatian Association of Criminal Law and Practice and the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague supported the event, which was aimed at improving co-operation and capacities of local courts to handle war crimes cases. 
Croatian attorney Anto Nobilo said the country's capacity to investigate and prosecute war crimes would be crucial for joining the EU.

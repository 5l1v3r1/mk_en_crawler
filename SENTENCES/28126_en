BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Chamber of Deputies adopted a bill Tuesday (October 19th) that redistributes the workload of senior courts in order to speed up trials and consolidate proceedings.
In its July report, the European Commission (EC) criticised -- under the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism -- the slow implementation of Romania's judicial reform and anti-corruption measures.
The EC also made some recommendations aimed at consolidation, improving oversight, setting up a more transparent judicial system and reducing backlogs.

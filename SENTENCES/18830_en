THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial against former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who is also the former head of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), began at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague on Monday (March 5th). 
Haradinaj and two other former KLA members are charged in connection with the murder, rape and torture of Serbs and suspected ethnic Albanian and Roma Serb collaborators during the 1998-1999 conflict. 
Last week, all three defendants entered pleas of not guilty. 
Haradinaj is the highest-ranking ethnic Albanian official to be charged by the UN court.

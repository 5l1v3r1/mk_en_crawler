NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian President Boris Tadic told participants at the 64th UN General Assembly session in New York on Friday (September 25th) that Belgrade will never recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state.
He urged other countries also to avoid taking this step.
Tadic said the International Court of Justice will likely deliver a judgement in 2010 on the legality of Kosovo's independence.
He voiced his expectation that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council will participate in the ICJ debate, which is set to begin on December 1st.

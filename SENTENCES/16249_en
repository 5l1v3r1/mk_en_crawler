VENICE, Italy -- The Council of Europe (CoE) said on Friday (October 13th) that the Venice Commission -- the CoE's legal advisory body -- would help write Montenegro's new constitution.
The decision was announced after a special session of the Commission, attended by Montenegrin Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivocapic.
At a news conference afterwards, Commission deputy secretary Thomas Markert said that they agreed to organise a public debate in Montenegro -- with the participation of Commission experts -- on the new constitution.
Markert stressed that it must result from broad political and public consensus.

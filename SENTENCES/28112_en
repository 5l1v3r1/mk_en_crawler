PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi says Kosovo expects Brussels to outline the strategy the country must follow for eventual EU visa liberalisation next month.
"Once we have the strategy we will be able to concretely fulfil our duties," Rexhepi said during a meeting Wednesday (August 18th) of the working group on visa liberalisation.
He pointed out that in order to receive the document, the government must prepare the law on return and the strategy for resettlement of returnees.
The government has been working on a self-compiled roadmap, based on the experience of countries in the region, as a head start.

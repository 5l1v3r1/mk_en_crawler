ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and his Serbian counterpart, Vojislav Kostunica, agreed on Wednesday (23 November) to put the burden of the past behind them and to work together for their countries' shared goal of EU membership.
Kostunica, paying a landmark visit to Zagreb, praised Croatia's "constructive approach" regarding Kosovo's future status.
The two leaders also agreed to speed up the return of refugees.
They pledged that Serbia and Croatia will work more actively together to determine the fate of some 1,200 Croats who went missing during the 1991-1995 conflict.

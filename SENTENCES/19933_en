ZAGREB, Croatia -- The justice ministry says it will ask Moscow to extradite Milan Mandic, an ethnic Serb sentenced in Croatia and wanted on an Interpol arrest warrant.
"Immediately after we receive confirmation of his arrest ...
we will request his extradition," Justice Minister Ana Lovrin said on Monday (October 22nd).
Mandic, a war-time police chief, was arrested late Saturday at the airport in Moscow.
In 1994, a Croatian court sentenced him in absentia to 14 years in prison for criminal acts against civilians in the eastern Croatian village of Bapska, between December 1991 and April 1992.

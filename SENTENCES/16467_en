SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) said on Tuesday (8 August) that the recent decision of Brcko's international supervisor Susan Johnson to abolish the application of entity legislation in the district is fully in accordance with her mandate.
The OHR statement stressed that the move would simplify legal procedures and represents a key step forward in transforming the district into a permanent unit of multiethnic local self-government.
Some politicians in Banja Luka and Sarajevo have criticised Johnson's move as unilateral and illegal.

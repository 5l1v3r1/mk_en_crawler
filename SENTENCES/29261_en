TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi urged local media on Monday (May 3rd) to function independently of politics. 
After a meeting with media representatives to mark World Press Freedom Day, Topi acknowledged "all journalists who have influenced democratic developments during the 20 years of Albania's democracy". 
Media representatives have complained that journalists lack collective contracts and that selective government treatment in advertising affects financial sustainability. 
Last month, Freedom House categorised media in Albania as "partly free".

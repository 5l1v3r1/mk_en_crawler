ATHENS, Greece -- The Olympic Flame's trip around the world started Wednesday (2 June) from Athens International Airport. 
The flame will visit 34 countries, beginning in Sydney, Australia. 
A total of 3,600 people will carry the Olympic torch.
In other news, organisers launched the final ticket-selling campaign on Tuesday. 
With 73 days to go before the start of the Games, two-thirds of the tickets remain unsold. 
But officials note that the best seats have been booked and that they have raised 75 per cent of the projected revenues.

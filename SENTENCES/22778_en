BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tomislav Nikolic, deputy leader of the main opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS), tendered his resignation at a party meeting on Friday (September 5th). 
The move came after the party decided not to back the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
SRS vice president Dragan Todorovic confirmed that the party shifted its position under pressure from its leader, Vojislav Seselj, who is currently on trial at The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
Nikolic had announced Thursday that the party would support the SAA, following the government's acceptance of an SRS proposal to amend the draft ratification law.
In other news Friday, President Boris Tadic ruled out the possibility of meeting his Kosovo counterpart Fatmir Sejdiu. 
Tadic said he could accept such talks only if they were organised under UN supervision and with the aim of discussing Kosovo's status.

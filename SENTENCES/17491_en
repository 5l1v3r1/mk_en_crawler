ANKARA, Turkey -- David Satterfield, senior adviser to US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, paid a daylong visit to Ankara Saturday (April 21st). 
He met with Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ertugrul Apakan and Turkey's special envoy to Iraq, Oguz Celikkol, as well as with Deputy Chief of General Staff General Ergin Saygun.
In a TV interview the same day, Sattersfield said Iraqi Kurds are not doing enough to stop the Kurdistan Workers Party's (PKK) violent attacks in southeast Turkey. 
Speaking to the pan-Arab satellite channel Al-Arabiya, he said the United States is currently trying to arrange talks between Iraq and Turkey over the matter. 
Referring to a recent statement by Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani -- who warned that Iraqi Kurds would interfere in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast if Turkey tried to involve itself in the future of Kirkuk -- he said the United States had explicitly criticised the remarks as unconstructive and harmful to bilateral ties.

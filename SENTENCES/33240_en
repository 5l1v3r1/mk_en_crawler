ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who is also the current European Council president-in-office, concluded his tour of the seven new members of the EU on Saturday (10 May).
Simitis visited Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
During his visits, he met with the presidents and heads of governments, discussing the future of the Union after its enlargement.
"They believe that Greece, a small country, managed to promote itself in the EU and for that reason they look at its experience and for its aid," Simitis said upon his return to Athens.

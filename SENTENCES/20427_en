SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An increasing number of local governments have been affected by the deluge of appeals filed against the results of the October 25th local elections and November 4th run-offs. 
Officials announced on Monday (November 12th) that a record 438 appeals have been reported so far, filed with all 28 administrative courts in the country. 
That means new mayors or municipal councillors in these areas will not be sworn in until all procedures are completed. 
Some experts say the elections involved the highest number of violations in years, including vote buying.

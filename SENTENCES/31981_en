BUCHAREST, Romania -- On Tuesday (22 October), Romania launched its first national strategy against the distribution and use of drugs. 
The initiative is being co-ordinated with the ''Fight Drug Use'' project funded by the EU through the PHARE programme, and involves Romanian, Spanish and British organisations. 
According to the interior ministry, over the past five years Romania has evolved from a drug transit country into a target country for drug suppliers and distributors. 
The strategy creates a framework for co-operation among line institutions and also aims to establish international co-operation in the field.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutor Ismail Sari confirmed on Wednesday (May 30th) that authorities had intercepted a large weapons shipment, hidden among construction materials on a train bound for Syria from Iran.
The cache was discovered last week, after Kurdish rebels bombed and derailed the train near the town of Genc in southeastern Bingol province.
Sources say the weapon shipment contained machine guns, pistols, a rocket launch pad and 300 rockets.

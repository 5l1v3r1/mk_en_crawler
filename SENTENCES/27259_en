TIRANA, Albania -- A NATO Parliamentary Assembly delegation, led by Sergio De Gregorio, said in Tirana on Monday (March 1st) that no one in the Alliance doubts the legitimacy of the current government and parliament.
NATO monitors said the June 2009 general elections were a well organised process, noted De Gregorio after meeting with Albanian leaders.
He added that Albania should be optimistic about EU visa liberalisation and its goal of eventual EU membership.
The opposition Socialist Party maintains that the June elections were manipulated.

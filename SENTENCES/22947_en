NEW YORK, United States -- UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz has invited Greek and Macedonian representatives Adamantios Vassilakis and Nikola Dimitrov to hold a fresh round of talks on the name dispute between the two countries Tuesday (October 7th) in New York.
Nimetz is expected to propose a new alternative name, Greek media reported.
Diplomatic sources in Athens expressed reservations about prospects for progress due to an escalating dispute between Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and President Branko Crvenkovski.
Last week, Gruevski reiterated his support for a "dual solution", using one name bilaterally between Greece and Macedonia and using another -- the Republic of Macedonia -- internationally.
Crvenkovski, however, says Skopje is ready to accept a "fair compromise" with Greece.
He admitted that he and Gruevski disagree on how to resolve the dispute.

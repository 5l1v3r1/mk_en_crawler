BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (July 22nd) delayed its expected response to a letter from Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
He had sent it to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso last week, asking the EC to pressure Greece to recognise the Macedonian minority on its territory and help settle the issue of Macedonian refugees there.
The EC reportedly wants a few weeks to review the letter from a technical and political point of view.

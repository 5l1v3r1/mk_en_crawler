BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Ali Babacan, Turkey's top EU negotiator, agreed on Tuesday (May 8th) in Brussels that accession negotiations may be opened in three more chapters of the acquis with Turkey before July 1st. 
That is when Portugal assumes the rotating EU presidency from Germany. 
In December, the Union decided to suspend negotiations in eight of the 35 chapters, due to Turkey's refusal to open its ports and airport to Cyprus. 
Talks are currently continuing in two areas -- science and research and industrial affairs.
In a speech marking Europe Day, commemorated every May 9th, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for support of Turkey's EU integration.

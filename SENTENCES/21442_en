SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament plans to vote on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev's cabinet late Wednesday (July 30th). 
Opposition parties filed it after receiving backing by more than 80 lawmakers, including representatives of right-wing parties and the 13 independents. 
The motion alleges the cabinet has failed to effectively manage EU funding and is incapable of meeting EU criteria. 
Last week's highly critical European Commission report that concluded Bulgaria has failed to tackle high-level corruption and organised crime triggered the motion.

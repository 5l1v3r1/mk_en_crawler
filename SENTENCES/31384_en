SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski went before parliament on Friday (25 April) to explain the reasons behind his decision to pardon former Interior Minister and incumbent Intelligence Agency Director Dosta Dimovska.
Trajkovski said he saw no compelling evidence of Dimovska's involvement in the largest ever wiretapping affair in Macedonia.
He added that continuing the investigation would result in discrediting and eliminating a competent head of a crucial security institution, which would threaten security and stability.
Dimovska and one of her closest associates, Aleksandar Cvetkov, the former head of the interior ministry's operational technology department, were charged with the illegal surveillance of hundreds of politicians and journalists in 2001.

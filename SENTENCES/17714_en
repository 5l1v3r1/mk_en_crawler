SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak municipal councillors in Srebrenica adopted a resolution Saturday (March 24th) that would remove the municipality from Republika Srpska's (RS) jurisdiction and give it special status within BiH. 
Calls for such action began almost immediately after the International Court of Justice in The Hague recently ruled that genocide had been committed against Bosniaks in Srebrenica in 1995. 
Serb members of the Srebrenica assembly insist that municipal authorities lack the mandate to adopt such resolutions, which they say violate both the RS Constitution and the Dayton Peace Agreement.

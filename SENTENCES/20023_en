THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial against Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who is charged with crimes against Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s, will begin in November, Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti announced on Friday (August 17th) during Seselj's status conference. 
Nagging issues, such as the financing of Seselj's defence and translating documents into Serbian, have been resolved, the court said. 
Seselj had wanted the trial postponed until March 2008, arguing he needed more time to prepare his defence. 
Proceedings began last November, but had to be suspended after he launched a hunger strike, demanding the right to represent himself.

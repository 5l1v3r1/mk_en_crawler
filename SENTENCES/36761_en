THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal is considering splitting the trial of Slobodan Milosevic in order to wrap up the proceedings by October 2005. 
The panel of judges on Wednesday (21 July) asked prosecutors and court-appointed lawyers who oversee the hearings to present their opinions on the possibility of dividing the defence phase into several indictments. 
Judges originally wanted two separate trials -- one for Milosevic's involvement in the Kosovo crisis and the other for his role in the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. 
Though prosecutors opposed that move, an appeals panel ruled in favour of consolidating the indictments against Milosevic.

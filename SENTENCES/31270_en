WASHINGTON, United States -- The treasury on Tuesday (February 1st) blacklisted two Turkish companies for providing materials and support to Iran's ballistic missile industries. 
According to an official statement, the network, led by Iranian national Milad Jafari and consisting of a total of six individuals and five companies, facilitated over $7m worth of transactions for Iran's Aerospace Industries Organisation (AIO), which oversees Iran's missile industries. 
The transactions to procure metal products, including steel and aluminium alloys for AIO's subordinates, occurred in 2007-2008, the treasury said. 
The two Turkish companies -- Macpar Makina and Step AS -- provided material, technological or other support to AIO's subordinates.

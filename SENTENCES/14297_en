THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal's trial chamber found Croatian journalist Ivica Marijacic and former security official Markica Rebic guilty of contempt on Friday (10 March) and fined them 15,000 euros each.
The tribunal says Marijacic, former editor-in-chief of the Zagreb weekly Hrvatski List, and Rebic, former head of the Croatian Security Information Service, deliberately revealed details of testimony given by a protected witness in the trial against former Croatian Army general Tihomir Blaskic.
Defence lawyers plan to appeal the verdict.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday (February 15th) to discuss Greece's financial crisis, though it's unclear whether specific measures to support the economy will be approved. 
French Economy, Industry and Labour Minister Christine Lagarde said the issue will be discussed "without a doubt". 
The EU and the IMF are closely watching to see if Greece will begin paying its debts.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on Sunday urged Athens to take all appropriate measures to reduce its ballooning budget deficit. 
"All of Greece must realise that it must correct a trajectory which has been aberrant," Trichet told French TV channel LCI.

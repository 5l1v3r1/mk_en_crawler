SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The European Commission (EC) briefs EU interior ministers Thursday (June 4th) on progress Western Balkan countries have made in their visa-liberalisation processes, according to Macedonian media.
No discussion is expected for now;
the foreign ministers of the EU member states will debate it instead at their meeting later this month.
Macedonia reportedly received the highest mark in the EC's report, covering efforts by Western Balkan countries to meet criteria for joining the EU's visa-free travel area.
While visa requirements could also be abolished for Montenegrin citizens, Serbia still faces "certain difficulties" regarding visa liberalisation criteria, the document reportedly concludes.
Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have failed to meet the benchmarks for visa liberalisation, according to local media.

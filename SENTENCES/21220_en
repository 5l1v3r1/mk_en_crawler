BELGRADE, Serbia -- The foreign ministry said on Sunday (June 29th) that it had dismissed Serbian Vice Consul to the US Igor Milosevic after an investigation determined that he helped Serbian national Milan Kovacevic -- indicted for attempted murder in Binghamton, New York -- leave the US by issuing him an illegal emergency passport.
The ministry has launched further disciplinary action against Milosevic.
New York's two senators, Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, insist that Serbia arrest Kovacevic and extradite him back to the US.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey could amend a provision in its criminal code that has been criticised by the EU for curbing free speech.
Article 301 of the law makes it a crime to offend the Turkish character and has been used to prosecute a number of intellectuals.
"To prevent a violation of freedoms ...
we are studying several options for how we can handle Article 301 in harmony with the spirit of the reforms," Erdogan told representatives of NGOs on Sunday (November 5th).
His statement appeared to signalled a policy shift, as he said only recently that the government had no plans to amend the criminal code.
On Wednesday, the European Commission is due to unveil its latest progress report, which is expected to be highly critical of recent trials of journalists and writers.
In other news, former Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit died in hospital late Sunday after spending five months in a coma as a result of a stroke.
He was 81.
Starting his political career as a left-wing lawmaker in the 1950s, Ecevit later turned towards the West, finally leading his country onto the road to EU membership.
He served as prime minister five times.

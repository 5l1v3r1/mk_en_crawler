SOFIA, Bulgaria -- At least one member of the current cabinet is linked to the former communist State Security (SS) service, said Metodi Andreev, former chairman of the parliamentary committee for dealing with the SS files.
In a TV interview Wednesday (20 October), Andreev said the unidentified minister was involved with the counterintelligence department and served under the name "Agent Kolev".
However, he refused to elaborate.
Last week, former Parliament Speaker Yordan Sokolov said two current cabinet ministers had been SS contributors.

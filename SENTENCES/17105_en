BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic sealed a decree Sunday (October 1st), formally setting the date of the constitutional referendum for October 28th-29th.
Markovic's move came a day after the legislators unanimously adopted a new constitution, stipulating that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia with substantial autonomy.
EU security chief Javier Solana's spokesperson, Cristina Gallach, said the status issue must be considered in the framework of negotiations mediated by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.

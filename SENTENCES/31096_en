VIENNA, Austria -- About 800 Bosnians staged a protest Sunday (March 6th) near the Serbian Embassy in Vienna demanding the immediate release of Bosnian Army General Jovan Divjak. 
Their banners read "Free Jovo". 
Bosnian Ambassador to Austria Haris Hrle told the crowd that the demonstration is not directed at any one country but aims to voice support for the general. 
Divjak was detained on Thursday at the Vienna airport, based on a warrant issued by Serbia. 
He was wanted in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The members of Bosnia and Herzegovina's tripartite presidency told US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman Friday (7 November) that their country is ready to send troops to Iraq. 
According to a statement released after the meeting, the presidency also asked the United States to keep its troops in BiH to protect peace and stability in the region. 
Grossman welcomed the start of the defence reform which would lead to the setting up of a central command structure with control over the armies of the country's two entities.

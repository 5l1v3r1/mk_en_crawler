ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Ankara on Tuesday (November 2nd) once again blocked access to the video sharing website YouTube, only days after Turkish users were allowed access to the platform which had been banned for 30 months due to videos deemed insulting to the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Ataturk.
Saturday's court decision to resume access to the website came after a group of people -- describing themselves as "volunteers" working with Turkish authorities -- managed to remove four videos from the website with the help of an automated copyright protection system.
YouTube, however, announced on Monday it would upload the videos again, saying that the copyright claims are invalid.
On Tuesday, Turkish authorities warned YouTube that it may face another ban unless it removes a video that spurred a political sex scandal earlier this year.
It showed Deniz Baykal, former leader of the opposition Republican People's Party, in bed with a female lawmaker.
The secretly shot video led to Baykal's resignation.
Blocked for several hours Tuesday, access to YouTube resumed again later in the day.

WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. Bush announced on Friday (May 30th) a series of sanctions against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
The measures are based on a law combating the drug trade, the White House said in a statement.
US citizens and companies are barred from any sort of financial or economic relationship with structures connected to the PKK.
All accounts tied to the organisation in US banks have been frozen.
The PKK is already on the US list of terrorist organisations, whose members automatically become subject of economic sanctions.
According to US and Turkish special services, one source of funding for PKK activities is drug trafficking to Western markets.

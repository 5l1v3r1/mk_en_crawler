SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Russian Ambassador to BiH Alexander Grischenko said Tuesday (22 March) that authorities are investigating the alleged presence of indictees wanted by The Hague tribunal on Russian territory.
His comment came during a meeting with BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic and Justice Minister Slobodan Kovac.
Grischenko said official institutions in Russia had never been involved in hiding fugitives.
In other news, former Bosnian Serb army Lieutenant Drago Nikolic made his first appearance before The Hague tribunal Wednesday, delaying his plea.
He faces charges stemming from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Nikolic, 47, surrendered to the tribunal last week.

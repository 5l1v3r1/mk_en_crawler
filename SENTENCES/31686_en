MOSCOW, Russia -- Army Chief of Staff Gen Anatoly Kvashnin confirmed on Thursday (10 April) that Moscow has decided to pull its troops out of the Balkan peacekeeping missions. 
Kvashnin told reporters that the move will be completed within the next two months. 
"There are no longer any military tasks in that region and they are unlikely to appear in the near future," he said. 
Russia has 650 peacekeepers in Kosovo and 320 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

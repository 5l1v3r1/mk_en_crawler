PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A team of 120 groups, consisting of officials from embassies in Kosovo co-ordinated by the head of the International Civilian Office Pieter Feith, will monitor Sunday's (December 12th) snap elections process. 
"The EU, as Kosovo's main partner, has made significant efforts to bring together diplomatic observers from the EU Member States and from other countries to encourage the upcoming elections in Kosovo are up to international standards," the ICO said in a statement Monday.
Meanwhile, the European Network of Election Monitoring Organisations (ENEMO) has confirmed itself as the only international organisation to observe Sunday's snap elections. 
About 170 observers will report from Kosovo. 
These elections will also be monitored by the largest number of local observers ever registered in Kosovo. 
The Central Election Commission has received requests to accredit about 31,000.

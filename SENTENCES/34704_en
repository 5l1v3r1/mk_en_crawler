NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Negotiations to settle the dispute between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island will remain difficult with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in the picture, said Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou on Monday (18 August). 
Turkish Cypriot elections are due in December and Iacovou believes Denktas and the parties that support him will lose. 
He said he hopes negotiations will resume soon after and lead to a settlement before 1 May, when Cyprus is due to join the EU, with or without the Turkish side.

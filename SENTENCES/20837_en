SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Border Police Deputy Director Vahid Alagic along with two officials from the State Investigation and Protection Agency -- Zija Landzu and Faik Spago -- are reportedly being suspended from their posts, now that BiH prosecutors are investigating their possible involvement in war crimes. 
SRNA news agency said on Thursday (December 6th) the three might be charged with crimes against humanity and the murder of 48 Serbs in the villages of Bradina and Glavaticevo during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Also on Thursday, BiH's new war crimes prosecutor David Schwendiman said it is very likely new indictments related to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre will be issued shortly. 
Schwendiman has formed a special team of prosecutors and investigators to proceed with the probe.

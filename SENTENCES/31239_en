SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria is ready to join Schengen "tomorrow", Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said on Wednesday (February 2nd) after a closed-door meeting with Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann in Sofia. 
According to Borisov, Bulgaria is not as corrupt as people in Western Europe would like to portray it. 
He was responding to an Austrian journalist who asked if Bulgaria was ready for Schengen though it ranks first in Europe in terms of crime and corruption. 
Bulgaria and Romania had hoped to join the EU's border-free zone in March, but now face a delay amid concerns raised by Germany and France.

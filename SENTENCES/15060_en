BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Visiting Belgrade on Thursday (1 December), Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin said his country would back any solution to the Kosovo status problem that is achieved via compromise and direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. 
Speaking after a meeting with his Serbia-Montenegro counterpart, Vuk Draskovic, Kalfin said Sofia favours a sustainable settlement of the Kosovo issue that would respect the existing borders in the region and would not destabilise the area.
In Sofia meanwhile, representatives of the Socialist International and leftist parties from Southeast European countries gathered to discuss Kosovo and co-ordinate stances. 
They offered to actively participate in the final status discussions and will draft concrete initiatives next week.

ATHENS, Greece -- Some of the bullets that killed a police officer Wednesday (June 17th) were from a gun previously used by an ultra-left organisation, police spokesperson Panagiotis Stathis announced.
Nektarios Savas, 41, was targeted by at least three armed men who escaped the scene by motorcycle.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Stathis said on Wednesday that the gunmen fired 15 to 20 bullets at Savas, who was in his car guarding the home of a witness testifying against the ultra-left group Revolutionary People's Struggle, known as ELA.
"There was no warning, no phone call.
This was a cold-blooded murder," Stathis said.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's war crimes court sentenced Bosnian Serb wartime commander Novak Djukic to 25 years in prison on Friday (June 12th) for involvement in the May 1995 Tuzla massacre. 
Djukic was found guilty of war crimes against civilians and violations of international law and the Geneva convention. 
The court found him guilty of ordering an artillery attack on the northeastern town of Tuzla that killed 71 people and injured more than 150. 
At that time, he was a regional commander of the Bosnian Serb army.
After the war, Djukic was promoted to the rank of general and was appointed chief-of-staff of the Bosnian Serb army. 
In 2005, he retired, and in November 2007 he was detained on war crimes charges in Banja Luka. 
Djukic's lawyer Nebojsa Pantic, told reporters he will appeal the sentence.

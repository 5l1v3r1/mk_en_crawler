TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted another three-year ban on motorised boats Thursday (February 4th), to help fight illegal trafficking. 
Tourist boats and jet skis will be excluded from the ban but will also be subject to a set of rules. 
The first four years of the moratorium have reduced the amount of illegal drugs crossing the Adriatic to neighbouring Italy, as well as human trafficking. 
The ban has been continuously criticised by the opposition for hurting local fishermen and tourism.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik on Saturday (December 9th) called on all fugitive war crimes indictees to surrender voluntarily, to enable the "full democratic development" of the entity. 
During a news conference in Banja Luka, Dodik said entity authorities acknowledge the need to complete the process and that he personally was prepared to head a panel that would make the arrests, if he knew the fugitives' locations. 
Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte claimed last week that Karadzic and another indictee, Stojan Zupljanin, were hiding in BiH.
At the same press conference, Dodik voiced opposition to any merger of the police forces of BiH's two entities. 
The EU has said that it would not sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH until this reform is completed.

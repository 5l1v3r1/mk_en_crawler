SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva said Tuesday (14 June) that all delays in EU-related legislation could be overcome in approximately two months, including key drafts in the area of judicial reform.
According to Kuneva, if the next parliament -- to be formed after the 25 June vote -- immediately starts working without a summer recess, the bills can be adopted by the end of September.
In other news, two Bulgarian soldiers were killed when their armoured vehicle slipped off an embankment and sank in a canal in Iraq late Tuesday.

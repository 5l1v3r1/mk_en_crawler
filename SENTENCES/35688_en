SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The British Home Office told the BBC on Monday (5 April) that the visa regime for Bulgarian citizens would not be abolished prior to Bulgaria's EU accession in 2007.
An official also denied allegations published in Sunday's <I>Daily Mail</I>.
The paper quoted Bulgaria's Ambassador to Britain, Valentin Dobrev, as saying London had once rejected Sofia's request for assistance in finding criminal suspects on British territory.
According to the publication, Bulgaria warned several times against issuing British visas to Bulgarian citizens with criminal pasts but obtained no assistance.
Later Monday, Dobrev said the quote had been taken out of context.

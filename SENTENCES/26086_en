ANKARA, Turkey -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Prime Minister Nikola Spiric visited Turkey on Tuesday (December 15th) and said Bosnians must engage in political dialogue to resolve their differences. 
"People cannot find a solution if they turned their backs on each other," Spiric said. 
EU and US officials have been working to get leaders of the main political parties to agree to constitutional reforms, aimed at moving BiH towards Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Little progress has been made, however.

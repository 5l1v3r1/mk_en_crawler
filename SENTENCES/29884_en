ZAGREB, Croatia -- Zagreb's District Court upheld on Monday (January 24th) the anti-corruption office USKOK's indictment against eight people suspected of embezzling at least 400m kunas (54m euros) from local food producer Podravka.
Among those accused is former Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec.
A panel of judges also turned down objections by the defence about unlawful collection of evidence.

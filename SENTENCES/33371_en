TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE believes the political climate in Albania has changed for the better, but positive effects are yet to be felt by the population. 
The head of the OSCE Presence in Albania, Ambassador Osmo Lipponen, presented the regular report on Albania Tuesday (3 June). 
Lipponen hailed the drive of political parties to find common ground and work more closely to overcome differences. 
He said that much remains to be done to improve the political situation in the country as well as enhance freedom of speech.

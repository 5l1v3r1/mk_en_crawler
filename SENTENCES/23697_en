ANKARA, Turkey -- Police on Wednesday (April 22nd) detained ten more people, including four military officers, in another wave of arrests related to the so-called Ergenekon organisation that allegedly planned to topple the government. 
They found a new arms cache in Istanbul as part of Wednesday's operation. 
Turkish media reported that the weapons found during a raid in the wooded area of Poyrazkoy included anti-tank rockets, grenades, handguns and ammunition.
Meanwhile, a group of NGOs announced on Wednesday that they will stage a protest in Ankara on May 17th against the Ergenekon investigations. 
Organisers hope it will be reminiscent of huge demonstrations in 2007 against the government's anti-secular activities.
In other news Wednesday, two people tried to set themselves on fire in front of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office in Ankara. 
The two incidents happened at different times of the day. 
Both men splashed gasoline over their bodies, but police managed to prevent them from going any further.

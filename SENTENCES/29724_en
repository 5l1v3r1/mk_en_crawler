NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou expressed his country's full support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) bid to join the EU as soon as possible. 
After a meeting in Nicosia on Wednesday (December 29th), BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj called for progress in talks to reunify the divided island. 
"We support discussions on resolving the standing differences between the two communities and we urge [them] to develop a plan to overcome remaining differences before the Secretary General's meeting with the two leaders at the end of January," Alkalaj said.

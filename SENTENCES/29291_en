ANKARA, Turkey -- Eight Turkish activists who were killed in a raid on a flotilla of ships carrying aid to the Gaza Strip were buried on Thursday (June 3rd). 
The ninth victim, a US citizen of Turkish origin, is being buried Friday. 
The official ceremony was held in Istanbul, and was attended by about 10,000 people.
In other news Thursday, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said the government has suspended all ongoing state energy projects and feasibility studies with Israel until ties between the two countries normalise. 
Yildiz said two joint projects are involved: the Manavgat River project -- carrying water from Turkey to Israel, and the Blue Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project, which is to provide gas to Cyprus, Israel and other Middle East countries. 
Turkey will initiate no part of the joint projects until it receives a full apology from the Israelis, Yildiz added.

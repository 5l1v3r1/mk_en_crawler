BUCHAREST, Romania -- Subway employees staged a two-hour warning strike Thursday (November 12th) demanding a 20% wage increase. 
The protest affected about 70,000 people using the subway in the early hours. 
Union leader Ion Radoi said members expect to be invited by the government to negotiate. 
However, Transport Minister Radu Berceanu has rejected the possibility of talks, arguing that subway workers have received two raises recently -- 23% in 2008 and 26% earlier this year. 
The union says it will stage a general strike next week if its demands are not met.

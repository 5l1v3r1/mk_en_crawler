NEW YORK, United States -- Despite repeated promises and deadlines, the authorities in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Republika Srpska have failed to improve co-operation with the tribunal, UN war crimes tribunal President Fausto Pocar told the UN General Assembly on Monday (October 9th). 
He said prosecutors remain troubled by the fact that six top indictees, including Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Separately Monday, tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte met with Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic at The Hague. 
She voiced satisfaction with the country's level of co-operation. 
As for Serbia, del Ponte will submit an evaluation report to the EU next week.

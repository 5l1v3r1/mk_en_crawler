BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US Ambassador to BiH, Douglas McElhaney, says true co-operation by Republika Srpska (RS) and Serbia with the UN war crimes tribunal would result in the capture of indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
In an interview in Thursday's (11 August) Nezavisne novine, McElhaney cited the recent "evident" pressure for the arrest of the two war crimes indictees and said the international community and the United States were breaking the fugitives' support networks.
If joint efforts of the RS and Serbian authorities and the international community were able to bring about Milan Lukic's arrest in Argentina earlier this week, McElhaney said, similar efforts could lead to Karadzic and Mladic.
On Wednesday, the US State Department issued a formal statement praising the Argentinean government for its work in arresting Lukic.
The former Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander is charged with the murders of 150 Muslims in BiH between 1992 and 1994.

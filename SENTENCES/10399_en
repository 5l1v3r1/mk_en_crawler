SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM) has experienced its largest decline in popularity in the past two years, Utrinski Vesnik reported Friday (22 October).
According to the regular survey of the US International Republican Institute (IRI), support for SDSM dropped from 25 per cent in June to 16 per cent in October.
The recent heated debates over decentralisation laws and the upcoming referendum on the issue were cited as the main reasons for the decline.
The main opposition, VMRO-DPMNE, also faced a slight decline in support, from 14 per cent to 12 per cent.
IRI reported that the majority of citizens consider poor economic development -- not political disputes -- the main problem facing the country.

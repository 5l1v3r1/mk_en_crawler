SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO's "Balkan Bus" left Skopje on Sunday (20 June), bound for the upcoming summit in Istanbul.
Over the course of the week, the bus will visit Bulgaria, Serbia-Montenegro, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to promote NATO ideas among young people in the region.
In other news Sunday, Andreas Klein, a representative of Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation, described Macedonia as a country with great potential and plenty of ideas.
He added, however, that poverty and high unemployment are impeding development.

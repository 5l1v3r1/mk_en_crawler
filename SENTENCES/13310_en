TIRANA, Albania -- Minister of Economy, Commerce and Energy Genc Ruli warned on Wednesday (26 October) that Albania's energy crisis is growing and could spin out of control within weeks. 
He told a session of parliament's energy committee that electricity reserves are sufficient only through the end of this month, with no energy resources available for November. 
Ruli blamed two factors: extremely low water levels -- in a country where most electricity is produced at hydro power plants -- and problems in other Balkan countries, making potential power imports impossible.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Wednesday (December 17th) called on main opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama to co-operate with the Socialist Movement for Integration in order to reach a compromise on the newly adopted election code. 
The controversial bill triggered a political crisis in November, as small opposition parties protested the exclusion of their representatives from election committees. 
Berisha's ruling Democratic Party and the SP adopted the code in parliament. 
President Batmir Topi, however, refused to ratify the bill and asked lawmakers to revise one provision.

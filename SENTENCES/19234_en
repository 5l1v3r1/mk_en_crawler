SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country assumed the rotating two-year presidency of the Process of Meetings of Southeast Europe Defence Ministers (SEDM) on Wednesday (August 29th). 
During a ceremony at the Goce Delcev military barracks, Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski said it was both a great honour and a major responsibility for the country. 
The SEDM members are Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United States. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia have monitor status.
In other news Wednesday, Elenovski dismissed as pure speculation reports suggesting that only Croatia would be invited to join NATO at the Alliance's summit in April 2008. 
Macedonia and Albania reportedly will remain on the waiting list until the Kosovo issue is resolved. 
Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki also appeared sceptical, saying he had no information from Brussels about a possible delay.

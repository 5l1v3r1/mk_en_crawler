ST PETERSBURG, Russian Federation -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer is urging Russia not to veto a new resolution on Kosovo at the UN Security Council. 
Attending a NATO-Russia seminar in St. 
Petersburg on Monday (June 25th), de Hoop Scheffer reiterated the Alliance's support for a fast settlement of the Kosovo status issue, based on UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan.
However, Sergei Mironov, chairman of the Russian Parliament's upper chamber, says it is highly likely Russia will use its veto. 
He accused the West of trying to build an Albanian state on historically Serbian territory. 
Moscow says this could set a precedent for breakaway territories such as Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Trans-Dniester.
Also Monday, outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged Kosovars to be patient and refrain from violence as the status process winds down. 
He added in a statement that Ahtisaari's roadmap is the only way to secure a politically and economically stable Kosovo.

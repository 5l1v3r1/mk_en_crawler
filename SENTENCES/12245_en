ZAGREB, Croatia -- Suspect Franjo Katavic confessed Thursday (12 May) to forging a passport for retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina, who is wanted by The Hague tribunal for war crimes. 
Katavic told Zagreb County Court investigating Judge Zdenko Posavec that the passport falsification was ordered by retired police officer Salih Fazlic. 
He added that one of Gotovina's attorneys, Marijan Pedisic, was behind everything. 
Fazlic and Pedisic, who were detained by police shortly after Katavic's arrest, have denied any connection to the case.
In other news Thursday, HINA reported the results of a new poll conducted by a Slovene agency. 
It asked members of the European Parliament how Croatia could best improve its international image. 
Nearly 25 per cent said the country should strengthen co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

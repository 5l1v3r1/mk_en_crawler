THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- With summer recess over, the trial against former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and Johan Tarculovski, a former security official, resumed on Tuesday (August 21st). 
They are charged with war crimes committed against ethnic Albanians during a two-day raid on the village of Ljuboten in August 2001. 
The specific violations include killings, beatings and arson allegedly committed by a police unit under Tarculovski's command.
Prosecutors say that as interior minister, Boskovski had command authority over the police and knew what would happen, but failed to prevent the crimes, properly investigate them, or punish those involved. 
He and Tarculovski are Macedonia's only war crimes indictees.

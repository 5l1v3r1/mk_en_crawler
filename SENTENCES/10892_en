LEFKOSA, Cyprus -- National Unity Party leader Dervis Eroglu announced on Monday (1 November) that he has been unable to form a new government in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
He blamed a lack of consensus among local politicians. 
President Rauf Denktash expressed disappointment and said he would tap someone else for the job. 
The previous ruling coalition, led by Mehmet Ali Talat's Republican Turks Party, split last month. 
Continued failure to reach a political agreement would lead to early elections.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- People across BiH headed for the polls on Sunday (1 October) for the country's fifth general election since splitting from the former Yugoslavia. 
Polls showed that three parties -- the opposition Social Democrats, the centrist Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Muslim nationalist Party of Democratic Action -- enjoyed more or less the same levels of support in the BiH Federation.
In Republika Srpska, the Serb Democratic Party, which was founded by Radovan Karadzic in the 1990s, appeared to be losing ground, paving the way for moderates to dominate the entity's politics. 
Preliminary results are expected around midnight.

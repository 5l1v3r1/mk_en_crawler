SANGACHAL, Azerbaijan -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer attended a formal ceremony Wednesday (25 May) near Azerbaijan's capital Baku, marking the launch of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline project.
The realisation of the project, initiated by Turkey in the 1990s and backed by the United States, took three years.
The costs are estimated at nearly $3 billion.
The pipeline is expected to carry 1 billion barrels of crude oil daily from the Caspian Sea region to Western markets.
The presidents of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan also attended the ceremony.
In other news Wednesday, Kurdish rebels ambushed and killed four members of the Turkish security forces, amid warnings that violence is on the rise in the troubled southeast.
Provincial governor Haluk Imga said two soldiers and two village guards -- members of a state-armed militia -- were killed when Kurdistan Workers Party guerrillas attacked their vehicle.

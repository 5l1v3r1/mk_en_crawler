SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The commander of EUFOR, Major General David Leakey, said Tuesday (8 February) that EU troops would not hesitate to arrest Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic or any other indictee.
He added that co-operation in bringing war criminals to justice is a key condition for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
That sentiment was echoed in Brussels during a Tuesday meeting between European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic.
Barroso said the EU might decide in May to open negotiations with BiH on the signing of a Stability and Association Agreement, provided the country improves its co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
In a separate statement Tuesday, it was announced that EUFOR personnel -- with the help of entity police forces -- will launch a major door-to-door weapons collection in Sarajevo and East Sarajevo on 21 February.
The operation will continue for two weeks.

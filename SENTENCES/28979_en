ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey might backtrack on its push for EU accession, President Abdullah Gul implied in an interview with the Turkish BBC service Monday (November 8th).
Specifically, he stressed that Turkey is making significant progress in implementing EU standards, adding this could be considered sufficient in itself, with no need to obtain membership status.
He was referring to the lack of concessions from the EU on the issue of the Turkish Cypriots and stressed that Turkey cannot be expected to remove the blockade on Cypriot ships in local ports since the country gets nothing in return.
The blockade is a key stumbling block in accession negotiations, as it is considered a violation of the main EU principle of the free movement of goods.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Agriculture Minister Michalis Polynikis announced on Thursday (June 26th) that Greece will begin providing water to Cyprus, which is facing a severe drought.
The first six tankers carrying about 50,000 cubic metres of water will arrive on Monday.
Those shipments are expected to reach 8 million cubic metres by November.
Average rainfall totals are 20% lower than normal on the island, which senior Cypriot officials blame on global climate change.

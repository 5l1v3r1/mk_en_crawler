NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says the UN mission in Kosovo stands ready to support an investigation into allegations of human organ trafficking raised in Dick Marty's report. 
In his regular quarterly report on Kosovo, Ban said that UNMIK delivered all documents to The Hague war crimes tribunal in 2003, and a complete file was handed over to EULEX in 2009. 
Ban wrote that Marty's document was hailed in Belgrade while Pristina and Tirana called it anti-Albanian and untrue. 
According to the Pristina-based Koha Ditore daily, Ban dedicated a vast part of his report to the work of UNMIK, especially in northern Kosovo, saying UNMIK's presence remains important for communication between communities.

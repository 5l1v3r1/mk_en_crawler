PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) has disconnected 17 stations of illegal Serbian telecommunication antennas around Kosovo.
The weekend action excluded the north, where authorities faced resistance in Serb-dominated areas, while in other parts of Kosovo the action irritated local Serbs and authorities in Belgrade.
According to Belgrade-based media, thousands of Kosovo Serbs were left without landline or mobile phone connections due to the TRA action.
Police and the TRA teams disconnected transmitters in the areas of Gracanica, Shtrpce, Gjilan/Gnjilane and Peja/Pec.
In Zubin Potok, northern Kosovo, the TRA failed to disconnect the illegal Serbian telephony station despite the presence of Special Police units.
A group of Serbs had barricaded the location earlier in the morning.
There were reports of gunfire, but police said the weather prompted the TRA to drop its effort there.
Officials first began removing antennas in the spring.
The illegal equipment is believed to be ringing up annual losses to Kosovo of 20m euros.

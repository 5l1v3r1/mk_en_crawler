ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish government announced on Monday (4 August) that a record number of tourists visited the country in July.
The Tourism Ministry released figures showing that more than two million foreigners visited Turkey last month, a 10 per cent rise from a year earlier.
In other news, the opposition Republican People's Party announced it will contest a new law allowing foreign nationals to buy land in Turkey.
The party insists the legislation is unconstitutional, as it does not take into account whether the foreign nationals' countries grant reciprocal privileges.
The ruling Justice and Development Party pushed for the adoption of the new legislation as an incentive for investors.

ANKARA, Turkey -- General Yasar Buyukanit, chief of the General Staff, said on Tuesday (December 11th) that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is being politicised and legalised.
He cited the presence of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) in parliament as an example.
Buyukanit also said that the only aspect of terrorism that has not been legalised is arming members and that domestic support for terrorism must be halted.
Meanwhile, the deputy chief of the General Staff, Ergin Saygun, criticised some EU members for supporting the PKK through some of their actions.
He also accused the PKK of using propaganda in the European Parliament, as well as in the UK and French parliaments.

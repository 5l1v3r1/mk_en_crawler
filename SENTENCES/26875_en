BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country observed a day of national mourning Saturday (September 5th) in memory of the victims of a series of explosions at the Prvi Partizan ammunition factory, in the town of Uzice. 
Seven workers were killed and 14 were injured in the blasts Thursday. 
A commemoration ceremony for the victims was held at the city's theatre. 
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says preliminary results of the investigation suggest human error was the likely cause of the explosion, rather than any kind of deliberate sabotage.

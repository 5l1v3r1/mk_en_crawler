ATHENS, Greece -- Investigators announced on Friday (19 August) that they have found the second black box of the Cypriot plane that crashed near Athens a week ago, killing 121 people. 
The recorder will be sent to Paris for an expert analysis, in hopes of determining what happened aboard the Boeing 737 during its final minutes. 
Coroners also ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning of the victims, citing results of completed tests. 
Some had previously suggested that a problem with the air conditioning system or an electrical problem might have released deadly levels of carbon monoxide into the cabin. 
Tests for other gases, poisons, drugs and alcohol are under way.

BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Susan Johnson, the international supervisor of Brcko, issued an order Friday (4 August), abolishing the application of entity legislation in the district.
According to the decree, until district laws are enacted to replace the repealed ones of Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH, existing state-level legislation will be used.
She did not elaborate.
Under the Dayton agreement, Brcko district is an administrative unit in BiH, separate from the two entities and governed by an international supervisor.
Bosnian Serb leaders, however, have reacted strongly to Johnson's order, accusing her of violating Dayton and attempting to create a third entity.

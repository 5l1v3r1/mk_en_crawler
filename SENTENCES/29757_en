TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) said on Tuesday (May 24th) it does not recognise the final results of the May 8th mayoral election in Tirana, finally announced by the Central Election Commission.
SP leader Edi Rama, the incumbent mayor, said the government manipulated the result by adding votes that do not correspond with the voters' list -- ones that had been cast into the wrong boxes -- effectively stealing victory from him.
By counting them, Lulzim Basha of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) won by 81 votes in a race in which more than 250,000 were cast.
Basha says he will wait until all complaints are resolved.
"After that, we will join together to develop Tirana as the city deserves," he told a press conference.

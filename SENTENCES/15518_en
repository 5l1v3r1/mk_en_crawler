TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) has approached the constitutional court, complaining about alleged misuse of power by the ruling Democratic Party (DP)-led coalition. 
A statement the SP issued on Monday (24 April) said that party secretary general Pandeli Majko sent a letter to the court's chairman, voicing concern over recent government actions that he says threaten the independence of institutions and human rights, as well as Albania's democratisation and Euro-Atlantic integration. 
The DP has made no public comment.
In other news, the Vatican's highest-ranking official for foreign relations, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, visited Tirana on Monday, and expressed strong support for the country's EU integration. 
He met with Albanian President Alfred Moisiu and Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli.

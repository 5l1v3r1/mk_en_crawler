SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Monday (10 January) that he would decide by the end of this month which of three proposals by the BiH Police Restructuring Commission would be the basis for reform.
Ashdown added that the strategy would be then subject to talks with the three constituent peoples in BiH, as well as debates within the state and entity parliaments.
He said he expects a final agreement in the spring.

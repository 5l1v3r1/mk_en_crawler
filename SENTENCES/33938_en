BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The confidence vote in the Serbian government was put off Thursday (6 November) until after the 16 November presidential election. 
Serbian Parliament Speaker and interim President Natasha Micic adjourned the debate on the vote until 18 November, noting that 24 out of 28 parties are participating in the elections. 
The government has faced an uphill battle in parliament, since effectively losing its majority. 
It is not clear when the no confidence vote involving Micic would take place.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament passed a bill Wednesday (December 1st) that will stop agents and informers of the former communist-era secret services from receiving state honours. 
The legislation, approved by an overwhelming majority, was proposed by the anti-communist Blue Coalition party. 
Lawmaker Latchesar Toshev, who submitted the bill, said that even now, 20 years after the fall of the communist regime, people who worked as full-time or informal employees of the secret service continue to receive state orders and medals.

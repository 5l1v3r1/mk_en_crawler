ZAGREB, Croatia -- General Ivan Cermak, who was just acquitted of war crimes charges by The Hague war crimes tribunal, was admitted to hospital late Saturday (April 16th).
Though his condition is not serious, it is expected to take several days to treat.
On Friday, the tribunal found two other Croatian generals -- Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac -- guilty of war crimes stemming from the 1995 military operation Storm and sentenced them to 24 years and 18 years in prison respectively.
The court found that they had participated in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at forcibly and permanently removing the ethnic Serb population from the Krajina region of Croatia.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition New Kosovo Alliance leader Behxhet Pacolli called for early elections and the establishment of a technical government on Monday (April 5th).
Pacolli criticised the recent government reshuffle by saying that the changes made are limited only to the replacement of some ministers with others.
Meanwhile, local media reported Monday that the ruling coalition partners -- the Democratic Party and the Democratic League of Kosovo -- have agreed to replace six new deputy ministers.
Anonymous sources said that Prime Minister Hashim Thaci will announce the new names this week.
Six ministers were replaced last week.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was re-elected leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE at the party congress Sunday (March 18th). 
He was the only candidate for the post. 
In his speech, Gruevski said the next four years would be challenging for the government, given expected progress in the NATO and EU integration bids. 
He also vowed to step up the fight against corruption and organised crime.
On Saturday, Gruevski met with President Branko Crvenkovski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki in a bid to harmonise positions on major foreign policy issues. 
They said they have a general consensus regarding Macedonia's name dispute with Greece.

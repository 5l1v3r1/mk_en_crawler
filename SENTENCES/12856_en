SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The chief of the European Commission's (EC) Delegation to Macedonia, Ambassador Donato Chiarini, expects Macedonia to get a green light on its application for official EU candidate status by year's end. 
Chiarini told local A1 TV on Friday (1 April) that while it is too early to discuss specific dates for launching EU membership talks, it would depend on implementing the crucial political criteria -- strengthening the rule of law and combating corruption -- as well as judicial reform and economic development.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development Petar Cobankovic visited flooded areas in Slavonski Brod on Friday (June 4th), meeting with local farmers.
The heavy rainfall in eastern Croatia that started about a week ago has brought damages totalling least 138m euros, according to initial estimates quoted by local media.
The figure will increase after estimates of infrastructure damages, which will also be considerable.
Although the water levels are subsiding, local authorities warn that dangers persist due to potential overflows from some of the rivers in the region.

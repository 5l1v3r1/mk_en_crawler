ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministry issued a travel advisory Tuesday (March 3rd) for Greek citizens travelling to neighbouring Macedonia, warning them to pay "particular attention" to their safety during their visits. 
The warning followed an attack by about 30 vandals on three buses carrying Greek tourists Sunday in Ohrid. 
According to Greek media reports, the attackers threw stones at the buses, injuring two of the tourists. 
They also spray-painted nationalistic slogans on the vehicles.
On Tuesday, the Macedonian foreign ministry rejected Greece's accounts of the incident, describing the latter government's reaction as "inappropriate and exaggerated".

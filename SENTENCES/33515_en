BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR reported Wednesday (24 September) that its troops collected more than 120 tonnes of illegal weapons and ammunition, mostly in the Prijedor area, during a three-week operation called Dynamic Response 2003. 
About 350 US troops were flown in for the operation, which also covered Kosovo.
In other news, the Bosnian Serb chapter of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights (HCHR) accused politicians in Republika Srpska (RS) of obstructing international efforts to bring war crime suspects to justice. 
"Not only is there no political will to investigate war crimes, but there is also maximum obstruction and direct pressure on both courts and prosecutors," said the head of the HCHR in RS.

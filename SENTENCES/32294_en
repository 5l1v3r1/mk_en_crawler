BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Two officials from Serbia's ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) indicated Wednesday (2 October) that the coalition would most likely be reconfigured. 
Nebojsa Mandic, deputy leader of the Movement for a Democratic Serbia, said that over the next three months a new group would be set up to include the Democratic Party, the Civil Alliance of Serbia, the Social Democratic Party, the Movement for a Democratic Serbia and all Vojvodina parties except the Vojvodina Reformists. 
Mandic said a meeting of the DOS presidency may occur before round two of the presidential elections.
Meanwhile, Vojvodina Reformists leader Miodrag Isakov said that a new coalition would be established to include the Democratic Alternative, the Vojvodina Reformists, the Sandzak Democratic Party and New Democracy. 
According to Isakov, all parties have already approved a coalition agreement. 
Democratic Centre has also confirmed an interest in participating.

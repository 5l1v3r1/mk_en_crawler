ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian Interior Minister Tomislav Karamarko said on Saturday (February 27th) that a large bust of marijuana on Friday had a major impact on drug markets there. 
The operation -- dubbed Balkan Soldier -- resulted in the arrest of two Montenegrins in a truck said to be loaded with 150kg of marijuana. 
The two, aged 36 and 51, were caught at the Croatian-Slovenian border. 
The drugs, valued at around 560,000 euros, are believed to have been destined for Western Europe.

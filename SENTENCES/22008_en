PRISTINA, Kosovo -- At a roundtable discussion Thursday (November 20th) in Pristina, experts criticised Kosovo leaders for inactivity on the world stage since the young country's declaration of independence in February.
The Friedrich Ebert Foundation organised the roundtable.
Participants said Kosovo is losing momentum because of its "summer hibernation" and because it lacked an operational plan to manage the situation after independence and still has not yet extended its authority throughout Kosovo.
In other news Thursday, British Ambassador to Belgrade Stephen Wordsworth predicted an agreement on UNMIK's reconfiguration by the end of next week.
Wordsworth said while his country supports the UN's six-point plan for deploying the EU-led EULEX mission in Kosovo, London wants an agreement acceptable to all.

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission's (EC) Ambassador to Tirana, Lutz Salzmann, has implied that the EC is willing to accelerate the pace of Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with Albania, according to reports Wednesday (28 September) in the local press.
Meeting with Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj earlier this week, Salzmann suggested that Brussels would like to finalise the SAA negotiations -- launched in early 2003 -- as soon as possible.
The EC envoy welcomed the "good start" made by the new government and called for intensified efforts to implement reforms.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Four lending institutions launched the Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF) on Wednesday (December 9th), which aims to provide funding for priority projects in the region.
Initially, these projects will relate to infrastructure, but will later be expanded to supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises, energy efficiency and other investment initiatives.
The four lenders are the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Council of Europe Development Bank.
At its first meeting, the WBIF steering committee decided to allocate 26m euros as grants for 26 projects across the region.
In the future, the initiative is expected to attract loans worth 2.2 billion euros from international financial institutions.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian presidency member Ejup Ganic plans to file a lawsuit against Serbia over his detention in London on charges of war crimes. 
His lawyer, Damir Arnaut, said on Thursday (August 26th) that Ganic spent five months in London victimised by "abuse of the British legal system for political purposes". 
He was arrested in London on March 1st based on an international arrest warrant issued by Serbia. 
Belgrade insisted Ganic should be extradited to Serbia to face charges for war crimes against soldiers of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) committed in Sarajevo in 1992. 
Instead, the extradition court in London eventually rejected Serbia's request and released Ganic.

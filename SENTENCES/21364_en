ANKARA, Turkey -- Thirteen immigrants were found dead near Istanbul after suffocating in an overcrowded truck Wednesday (July 30th), authorities said.
Their bodies were dumped in a field in the city's outskirts.
The 13 were among 80 people from Pakistan and Myanmar who made a clandestine 1,650-km journey from the eastern province of Van, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said.
"This is a tragic example of human-smuggling," he said.
Police are looking for the driver, who fled after dropping off the bodies, as well as for the surviving immigrants, in the Kucukcekmece district.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of the eight main parties in BiH have reached an agreement about the future status of the BiH Council of Ministers.
During the latest round of constitutional reform talks, held in Sarajevo Saturday (17 December), they agreed that the government will be led by a prime minister and will include two new ministries at the state level -- an agriculture ministry and a ministry of technology, science and environmental protection.
All cabinet decisions will have to be taken with a consensus or a majority, which must be based on support of at least one minister from each of the country's three constituent groups.
No deal has yet been achieved on issues related to the state-level presidency and parliament.
The next round of negotiations is expected to take place on 21 December.

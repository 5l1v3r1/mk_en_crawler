TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) backs the election of a president by consensus and would support a second term for incumbent Alfred Moisiu -- whose election in 2002 resulted from an unprecedented political agreement.
His term expires on July 24th.
SMI spokesman Sokol Dervishaj said at the weekend that his party welcomes Prime Minister Sali Berisha's initiative for a roundtable with the opposition on the issue, but urged that the discussion be broadened to include political consensus on other reforms.
He added that successful dialogue would stabilise political ties, guarantee better governance and eventually, Albania's integration in NATO and the EU.

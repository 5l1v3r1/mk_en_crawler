BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's Special Court signed the verdict against 26 members of the Zemun Clan on Wednesday (August 6th), eight months after it was handed down. 
In January, judges convicted 26 members of the gang, eight of whom remain at large. 
They received a total of 465 years in prison for 18 murders, three kidnappings and two terrorist attacks. 
They also faced charges of organising the 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
The verdict document, composed of more than 1,000 pages, took months to compile. 
Once all the parties involved -- including the defendants and their lawyers -- receive copies, they will have 15 days to appeal the verdicts.

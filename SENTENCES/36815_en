PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE has called for Kosovo local authorities to be involved more actively in stabilising the province. 
Mauricio Massari, the head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo, said Thursday (15 July) that local leaders must work harder to assist with the process. 
"The multiethnic stabilisation began in 2001 and has had much success, but is far from over," said Massari.
In other news, USAID is introducing a new programme in Kosovo. 
Mission chief Ken Yamashita says the three-year initiative is aimed at improving the work of local governments in the province.

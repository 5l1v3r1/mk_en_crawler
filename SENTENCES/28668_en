BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL), the two largest opposition parties, are closer to filing a joint no-confidence motion against the government. 
After PSD leaders met on Monday (May 10th), the party expressed readiness to discuss its strategy with the PNL. 
Both parties have announced they would oppose additional austerity measures, backed by the IMF, due to their impact on the public. 
The opposition also says the IMF has been too lenient towards the government and that the latter has consistently failed to meet its commitments (Cotidianul - 11/05/10; Reuters, Mediafax, Ziare, Hotnews.ro - 10/05/10)

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The war crimes trial against politician Branimir Glavas continued on Tuesday (December 4th).
Glavas said that had he wanted to hide the murders of civilians he could have done it.
He added that if protecting one's town and its people is a war crime, then he is ready to be labelled a war criminal.
Glavas and six other defendants are charged with war crimes committed in the eastern Croatian Osijek region in 1991, including the torture and murder of about a dozen ethnic Serb civilians.
When the defence portion of the trial began on Monday, he denied all charges against him, including the one about forming a paramilitary unit.
He said that at the time of the alleged crimes, he did not have "command over any unit".
He instead blamed former Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks, who was in charge of the "crisis headquarters" in Osijek at the time.
Glavas, who was re-elected to parliament on November 25th, is the first Croatian politician to be prosecuted for war crimes.

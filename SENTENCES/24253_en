ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis urged the Macedonian authorities on Saturday (April 11th) to "give up attempts to twist and re-write history" and adopt a more co-operative stance in the ongoing name dispute with Greece. 
He warned politicians in Skopje that their choice will determine their country's Euro-Atlantic integration process. 
"The path ... 
unavoidably passes through good neighbourly relations with all the members of the European family. 
Another primary prerequisite is a mutually acceptable solution [to the name dispute]," Karamanlis said during a visit to Greece's West Macedonia region. 
Greece vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO a year ago because of the name dispute.

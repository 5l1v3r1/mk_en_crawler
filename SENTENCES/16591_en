TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Appeals Court in Tripoli on Thursday (11 May) opened the retrial of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor accused of infecting Libyan children with HIV, but then adjourned the session until 13 June. 
The presiding judge said the delay was due to "procedural reasons". 
He also rejected a bail request for the defendants, who have been in prison since 1999. 
Late last year, the Libyan Supreme Court abolished the death sentences issued for the six in May 2004 and ordered a retrial.
In other news, another contract killing of a Bulgarian businessman, allegedly linked to the local mafia, occurred in downtown Sofia on Wednesday evening. 
Ivaylo Markov, 42, was shot dead in his underground parking garage. 
The victim was a shareholder in a number of firms and was linked to crime bosses who were murdered in the past few years. 
The new killing comes less than a week before the European Commission presents its crucial report on Bulgaria's bid to enter the EU in 2007.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney warned on Thursday (27 April) that the BiH Parliament's failure to adopt crucial constitutional changes sent a negative message to NATO and the EU and will certainly have consequences. 
His statement came a day after the BiH House of Representatives rejected the reform package, hammered out during months of negotiations among the seven main parties. 
The measures would have shifted some power from BiH's two entities to the central cabinet, streamlining the government. 
High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling and European Commission (EC) Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft issued separate statements Thursday, also voicing disappointment.

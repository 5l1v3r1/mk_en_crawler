SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski confirmed plans for a cabinet reshuffle in October, in a statement to the local A1 TV Saturday (20 August). 
He stressed that the changes would be aimed at improving the multiethnic coalition government's performance, but did not elaborate. 
According to media reports, Buckovski will likely propose the transfer of the agriculture ministry as well as the transport and communications ministry, now controlled by the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), to Buckovski's Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and Risto Penov's Liberal Democratic Party, respectively. 
In turn, the DUI will be offered the culture and labour ministries.

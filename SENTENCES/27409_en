SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Rescue teams continue to search Tuesday (November 30th) for five sailors missing since two vessels collided near Bulgaria's Black Sea coast late Monday. 
Five members of the crew have been rescued and are in good health. 
According to one of the survivors, two died at the scene, which means authorities are searching for three survivors. 
An investigation is under way to determine the cause of the crash. 
One of the ships -- sailing under Sierra Leone's flag -- was transporting scrap and sank after hitting the other, a tanker sailing under the Dutch flag, which was not badly damaged. 
No immediate threat of environmental pollution has been reported.

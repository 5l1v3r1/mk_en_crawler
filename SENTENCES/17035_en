ANKARA, Turkey -- Sumru Cortoglu, 63, was elected on Tuesday (2 May) to head Turkey's top administrative court, the Council of State. 
She was backed by 48 members of the Council, compared to 28 votes for her opponent, acting chairman Tansel Colasan. 
Cortoglu thus becomes the first female chairperson of the institution and the second at the helm of a senior Turkish court. 
Tulay Tugcu was elected Constitutional Court chief last year. 
The EU has been pressing candidate member Turkey to improve women's rights.
In other news Tuesday, Istanbul police chief Celalettin Cerrah announced that police detained ten suspected terrorists, who were reportedly preparing attacks on public institutions. 
The detainees are alleged members of an extreme left-wing organisation, TKP-ML/TIKKO.

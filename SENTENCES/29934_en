PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Enthronement of the newly elected bishop of Raska and Prizren Teodosije takes place on Sunday (December 26th) in Prizren. 
Serbian President Boris Tadic's adviser, Mladjan Djordjevic, is attending the ceremony as is Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic. 
Bishop Teodosije replaces Bishop Artemije, who was stripped of his title in November after he occupied a monastery in Kosovo and performed a service in defiance of the church's orders.

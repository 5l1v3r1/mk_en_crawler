PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A second-level court including EULEX judges decided on Thursday (March 12th) to acquit and release Kosovo Albanian Florim Ejupi from prison for lack of evidence. 
Prosecutors had charged him with killing 11 Kosovo Serbs and wounding another 22 during an attack on a bus in Merdare, near the border with Serbia, in February 2001. 
Last June, a UNMIK judicial panel sentenced him to 40 years in prison. 
He has been imprisoned for five years.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A heat wave and a drought are crippling shipping, shriveling crops and driving up the cost of electricity in the Balkans and across Western Europe.
In Romania, dredgers dug into the Danube on Monday (28 July) to deepen the river bed for hundreds of stalled barges.
Croatia's major rivers -- the Sava, Drava, Kupa and Danube -- were reported at their lowest levels ever, posing the threat of water and electricity shortages.
Serbian Ecology Minister Adjelka Mihajlov said his republic's major rivers were at the lowest level in 100 years.
Workers at Romania's only nuclear power plant, in Cernavoda, were ready to shut down its reactor if water levels fell another 3.3 feet.
Rivers in the forests of northwestern Croatia were so low that some systems were pumping mud instead of water.
Residents had to have bottled water delivered to their doorsteps.

TIRANA, Albania -- An official of the IMF Mission in Albania, Gerein Bell, warned on Saturday (November 3rd) that the current power supply crisis may cause huge economic problems for the country.
Bell blamed the national power utility KESH for failing to properly manage difficulties in past years, and added that winter rains provide only a short-term solution to the problem.

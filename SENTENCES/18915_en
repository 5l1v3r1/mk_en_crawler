SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court confirmed on Monday (December 4th) an indictment against three former Bosnian Croat army members, Marko Radic, Damir Brekalo and Dragan Sunjic. 
They are accused of crimes against humanity, stemming from incidents at the Vojnik wartime camp near Mostar.
In other news Monday, BiH Security Minister Barisa Colak officially denied recent media reports suggesting three BiH citizens were detained in northern Italy in an anti-terror operation. 
Colak said information from security services in Italy showed that there were no citizens with BiH passports among those arrested for alleged links to al-Qaeda.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Vice President Dick Cheney met with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday (12 July), focusing on bilateral ties and Kosovo.
Kostunica reiterated Belgrade's stance that independence is unacceptable, describing it as "extreme and radical".
Thursday, he is in New York, attending a UN Security Council session on Kosovo.
In other news, the Serbian government confirmed on Wednesday that it has drafted an action plan for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
It will be presented to the EU next week.
In May, Serbia's failure to arrest indictee Ratko Mladic prompted the EU to halt Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Belgrade.

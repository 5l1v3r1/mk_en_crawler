PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN officials announced Monday (20 June) that the bridge dividing the ethnic Albanian and Serb quarters of Mitrovica would be open to traffic for four hours every day. 
The bridge was open for one hour last week. 
While Serb protesters have been gathering daily to discourage ethnic Albanians from coming across, observers have said the number of protesters has dropped over the past week.

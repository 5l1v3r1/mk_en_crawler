NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President-elect Dimitris Christofias announced on Monday (February 25th) that he intends to restart UN-mediated talks with the leader of the northern Turkish community on the divided island, Mehmet Ali Talat.
"I have already contacted the UN representatives.
The first step will be to meet the Turkish Cypriot leader," Christofias said.
At a press conference in northern Cyprus, Talat said he urged Christofias to start peaceful negotiations as soon as possible.
"It will not be a surprise if we solve the Cypriot problem by the end of 2008," Talat said.
Critics say outgoing Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos made little effort to resume stalled reunification talks.

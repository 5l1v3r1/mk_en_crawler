WASHINGTON, United States -- IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn on Monday (April 4th) joined the EU and Greece in refuting media reports that the Fund will seek a restructuring of Athens' debt. 
Strauss-Kahn said a debt restructuring would not help Greece's competitiveness. 
The European Commission (EC) said on Saturday that it sees no reason to restructure the debt at the moment. 
Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou ruled out any such development as well. 
It was the German magazine Der Spiegel that first reported the story, citing unnamed sources.

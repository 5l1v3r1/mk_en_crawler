BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Mile Dragic, director of the military equipment manufacturer involved in a public procurement scandal, will be detained for one month, says Branislav Todic, investigating magistrate at the Belgrade district court. 
Dragic and three army officers will remain in custody, while a fourth officer was released after questioning, Todic said Wednesday (21 September). 
At issue is a controversial procurement deal worth 300m euro that has led to the resignation of federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic and to strained relations between Belgrade and Podgorica.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A lawyer representing Ratko Mladic's family plans to file a motion Wednesday (June 16th) to declare the former Bosnian Serb military commander dead.
On Monday, attorney Milos Saljic said he expects the court to respect the request, as relatives attempt to access Mladic's frozen assets and pensions.
They also say they want to put an end to all "pressure" exerted on them by authorities trying to locate the war crimes fugitive.
By law, the procedure can be initiated if the subject is at least 70 and there has been no reliable data on him for more than five years.
Mladic, however, is 68 and lawyers would need to prove that circumstances indicate he is dead.

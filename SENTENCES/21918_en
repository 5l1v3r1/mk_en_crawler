TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced a government reshuffle on Tuesday (July 22nd). 
Anila Godo was named new health minister, replacing Nard Ndoka of the Christian Democratic Party. 
Education Minister Genc Pollo is leaving his post to become the new deputy prime minister, a post left vacant in March when Gazmend Oketa became defence minister. 
Pollo will be replaced by Fatos Beja. 
Both parliament and President Bamir Topi must approve the changes.
In other news, it appears the two largest opposition parties are considering some level of future co-operation. 
The leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration, Ilir Meta, on Tuesday invited the Socialist Party to discuss election reforms. 
Squabbling between the two parties has prompted some members to switch ranks.

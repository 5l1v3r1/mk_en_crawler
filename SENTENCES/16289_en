ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for lawyer Alparslan Arslan, the main suspect in a 17 May attack on the country's top administrative court, the Council of State.
One judge was killed and four others wounded in the attack.
The indictment, made public on Thursday (13 July), accuses Arslan, 29, of "attempting to overthrow the constitutional order by force".
Eight other suspects have been charged as well.
Security at the court has been tightened in the aftermath of the incident.
Also Thursday, the trial of a Turkish teenager, charged with the February murder of a Roman Catholic priest in Trabzon, had to be postponed until 27 August, because witnesses failed to appear.
The trial is being held behind closed doors because the defendant is under-aged.
In other news, five soldiers were killed in a mine blast in eastern Turkey's Bitlis province.
Four other were wounded.
Authorities blame the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party for the incident.

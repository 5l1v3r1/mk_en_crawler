ANKARA, Turkey -- On Wednesday (17 September), Economy Minister Ali Babacan outlined the highlights of the government's economy programme for the remaining quarter of the year.
The major goals include gradual removal of state guarantees on bank deposits, decrease of the debt rollover ratio to 85 per cent by 2004, successful completion of the sixth review of Turkey's performance under its stand-by agreement with the IMF, and continuous implementation of World Bank programmes.
Babacan added that a major goal is to avoid resorting to use of an $8.5 billion loan from the United States.

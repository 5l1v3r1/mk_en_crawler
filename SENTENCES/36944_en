HAN PIJESAK, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO troops conducted a search in Republika Srpska on Thursday (1 July), a day after High Representative Paddy Ashdown sacked 60 officials for failing to arrest top war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic. 
Thursday's operation was near the eastern town of Han Pijesak, the main wartime base of former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic. 
The UN tribunal in The Hague has indicted Mladic and Karadzic for genocide committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
A SFOR spokesman declined to say whether the force, backed by local police, was searching for war crimes suspects.
On Monday, SFOR patrols began stepping up activities at all border crossings with Serbia and Montenegro, inspecting vehicles and passengers, as well as those using the old pedestrian bridge.

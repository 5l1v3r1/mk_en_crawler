STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday (23 June) told Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that it should adopt "concrete measures" to arrest top war crimes suspects. 
The European rights body said in a statement that continuing support for figures like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic is "an insult to the memory of the victims and a major obstacle to reconciliation".
In other news, international officials on Wednesday welcomed a statement by Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic in which he acknowledged Serbs' responsibility for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
A spokesman for Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, said the admission marked a historic moment in which Serbs confronted the truth about the crimes that were committed in their name. 
The European Commission's director for the Western Balkans, Reinhard Priebe, was in Banja Luka on Wednesday. 
He too praised the report by the Republika Srpska Srebrenica commission, while reiterating that the main issue is the arrest and handover of indictees.
Also Wednesday, the BiH presidency submitted to the state-level parliament its list of candidates who would serve as generals in the entities' armed forces. 
SFOR has already vetted the candidates.

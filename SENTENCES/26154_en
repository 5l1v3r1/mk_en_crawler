TIRANA, Albania -- The High Court suspended on Monday (September 14th) the case against former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, due to his immunity as a minister-designate. 
Mediu was approved by President Bamir Topi on Monday as the new environment minister and is only awaiting a routine vote by parliament to take over the post. 
He is accused of abuse of power at the defence ministry, in relation to the Gerdec ammunitions explosion in March 2008, which killed 26 people.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said in a press release Monday that ministers in the new government will be unable to hide behind immunity if legal procedures are launched against them.

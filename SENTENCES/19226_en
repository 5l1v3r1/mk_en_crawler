SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence ministry State Secretary Liljana Sterijovska resigned on Monday (January 28th) after being accused last week of forging the diploma that helped her land her job. 
Her Macedonian Social Democratic Union said it would wait for the findings of an ongoing investigation before deciding what to do. 
Sterijovska earlier rejected the allegations concerning her diploma in economics from Belgrade University.
In other news Monday, the US Embassy in Macedonia condemned a recent attack against Macedonian journalist Goran Gavrilov. 
The owner of local Kanal 77 radio station was attacked late Friday outside his home in Stip. 
In a statement, the embassy said the attack, in light of other attempts to impede the flow of information, raises concerns about Macedonia's democratic transition.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian Minister Veselin Bliznakov announced Thursday (24 November) that major cuts in modernisation projects for the armed forces are probable.
One of the first projects to be affected will be the delivery of transport airplanes.
Other projects will also be downsized or abandoned due to lack of funds in the 2006 budget, Bliznakov said.
Also Thursday, Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin and Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov were tapped to negotiate additional financial assistance for decommissioning the older nuclear units in the Kozloduy nuclear plant.
The move follows a recent report presented to the European Parliament by Bulgaria Rapporteur Geoffery van Orden, who suggested a more flexible approach towards Bulgaria's power-producing capacities.
The European Commission has earmarked 550m euros in financial assistance for 2007 to 2009.
However, the cabinet insists that financing be extended to 2013, requiring an additional 280m euros.

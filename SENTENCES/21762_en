SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Foreign Trade and Economy Minister Slobodan Puhalac resigned Thursday (June 19th), according to the press office of the BiH Council of Ministers.
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric accepted the resignation.
Puhalac said he is leaving for personal reasons and not because of any conflict within the government.
He confirmed he would most likely become Republika Srpska's economy minister, a post Rajko Ubiparip vacated in April for health reasons.

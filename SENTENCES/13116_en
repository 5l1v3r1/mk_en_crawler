ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The government is set to reduce public debt to 60 per cent of GDP in 2005 from 63.5 per cent in 2004, the country's finance minister told investors Tuesday (27 September).
Kemal Unakitan promised that taxes would not be raised to collect revenue.
Instead, the government will work to improve tax collection by going after the so-called "grey" sector of the economy.
Privatisation will be the other main source of income, he said.

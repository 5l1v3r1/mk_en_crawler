PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX deputy chief Andy Sparkes announced on Thursday (April 14th) that international judges and prosecutors will return to the court building in northern Mitrovica soon.
They were essentially forced out shortly after Kosovo declared independence in February 2008.
Sparkes told Serbian media that the return of local prosecutors in the north is a sensitive issue that will be resolved during the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
But Krstimir Pamtic, the mayor of the parallel Mitrovica North Municipality, said that the return of Albanian judges to Mitrovica North is unacceptable to local Serbs, and warned they will protest if it happens.

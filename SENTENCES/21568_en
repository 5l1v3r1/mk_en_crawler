PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci gave a positive assessment of Friday's (July 25th) UN Security Council meeting in New York, saying the council has accepted an independent Kosovo and the transitional phase will continue. 
"From now on there will be fast-track action on the reconfiguration of UNMIK, the transfer of competencies to local institutions and the deployment of EULEX on all of Kosovo's territory," Kuci said on Saturday.

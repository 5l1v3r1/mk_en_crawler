TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament voted Thursday (13 March) to send a small unit to participate in a possible operation to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime.
On Sunday, the cabinet decided to dispatch 70 soldiers to the Persian Gulf, as support personnel rather than combat forces.
The bill also authorises the government to offer Albania's air space and bases to US military forces for a possible operation against Iraq.

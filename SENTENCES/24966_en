TIRANA, Albania -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer invited Albania and Croatia to become the newest members of the Alliance on Tuesday (March 31st). 
In a letter to Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha, de Hoop Scheffer said he was honoured to communicate the news. 
He sent a similar letter to Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic. 
The two countries must submit their ratified membership protocols to the US State Department to complete the formal procedure and expect to do so on Wednesday, ahead of the Alliance's summit on Friday and Saturday in Strasbourg, France, and Kehl, Germany.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Xavier Bout de Marnhac said on Wednesday (April 6th) the mission is not dealing with individuals but is rather investigating cases for which it finds sufficient evidence, and sends them to court.
In an interview with the Koha Ditore daily, he added that from the investigation phrase, EULEX has now entered the trial phase and it will not stop.
The mission has found itself under huge public and political criticism for "criminalising the liberation war" fought by the Kosovo Liberation Army and for applying selective justice in favour of Serbs.
The most recent accusation has to do with Suhareka/Suvareka mayor Blerim Kuci who was arrested for failing to testify in a war crimes case.
Kuci accuses the EULEX of leading a political process.

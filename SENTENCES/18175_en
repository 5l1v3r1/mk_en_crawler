ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Supreme Court rejected on Friday (May 11th) an appeal by Parliament member Branimir Glavas and other six war crimes indictees against a lower court's decision to detain them. 
They are charged in relation to atrocities committed against ethnic Serb civilians in the eastern Croatian region of Osijek in 1991. 
The Osijek County court has had them in custody since late April, citing the gravity of the alleged crimes. 
Glavas is staging a hunger strike to protest this detention, as he did late last year. 
It eventually prompted officials to release him.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police detained more than 40 people early on Tuesday (April 14th), including three high-level officials from the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), in a simultaneous operation against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in 12 provinces.
Anti-terror police squads raided several locations across the country, including the DTP's offices and the headquarters of a local TV station in the south-eastern province of Diyarbakir.
DTP deputy leader Kamuran Yuksek and the lawyer representing imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan were among those detained, according to local media reports.
Police arrested another two senior DTP officials, Bayram Altun and Selma Irmak.
On Monday, police made a wave of arrests as part of the ongoing investigation into the shadowy secularist Ergenekon group.
The High Criminal Court in Istanbul ordered the detention of nearly 40 people at the request of prosecutors.
The suspects, including several academics, were detained in simultaneous operations in 13 provinces.
The Ergenekon group allegedly planned bombings and assassinations of high-profile politicians and public figures to incite chaos and overthrow the Justice and Development Party's government.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors announced on Wednesday (April 22nd) an investigation of Serb drug baron Sreten Jocic in connection with the October 23rd 2008 murder of journalist Ivo Pukanic. 
Investigators say Jocic commissioned and organised the car bombing that killed Pukanic and a colleague outside their office in Zagreb. 
The murders spurred a wave of protests against spreading corruption and organised crime. 
Prosecutors say they have a witness who has testified Jocic hired two men to kill the journalist. 
The witness says a third man, Milenko Kuzmanovic, whom police arrested immediately after the murders but released a month later, was also involved.

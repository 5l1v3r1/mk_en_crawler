TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu's adviser for legal issues, Artur Metani, said on Tuesday (26 July) that Moisiu would likely schedule the first session of the new parliament on 10 August, but only if the Central Election Commission (CEC) completes its review of election-related complaints. 
The vote was held on 3 July. 
The presidential aide also urged all political parties to avoid pressuring Moisiu on convening the legislature and to respect legal procedures.
Also Tuesday, the CEC decided to repeat the vote in two constituencies due to irregularities earlier this month. 
According to CEC representatives, the reruns are unlikely likely to affect the Democratic Party's victory.

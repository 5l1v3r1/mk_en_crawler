ANKARA, Turkey -- Lawmakers on Wednesday (October 21st) began debating the protocols signed earlier this month on normalising ties with neighbouring Armenia. 
Lawmakers representing opposition parties criticised the initiative and left the hall during remarks by members of the ruling Justice and Development Party.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Elhan Polhov announced on Wednesday that Turkey has filed an official protest over removal of its flag from the building of the Council of Religious Affairs at Turkey's diplomatic mission in Baku. 
"The Turkish Foreign Ministry has expressed its bewilderment" over the issue, stressing that the building where the council resides is part of the embassy's building, Polhov said, adding that Azerbaijan is working on a response.

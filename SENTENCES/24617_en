BUCHAREST, Romania -- Anti-corruption prosecutors announced on Thursday (March 5th) they had charged former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea with corruption. 
Mitrea allegedly took bribes worth about 213,000 euros between 2000 and 2004 in exchange for appointing Irina Jianu as deputy head of the country's construction works inspectorate. 
Prosecutors say construction companies connected with Jianu then built a house for Mitrea's mother for free. 
Mitrea says the charges are politically motivated. 
On Wednesday, parliament approved a proposal to lift former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase's immunity. 
He faces charges of taking bribes and forging official documents.
In other news, the government decided on Wednesday to hold elections for the European Parliament on June 7th. 
Romania will elect 33 members.

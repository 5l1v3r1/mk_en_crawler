ISTANBUL, Turkey -- For the third time in a month, Turkey's leading unions launched a mass demonstration against a proposed social security reform bill Sunday (April 6th).
Unions are demanding that the measure, sought by the IMF, be completely withdrawn, as it will gradually boost the retirement to 65 by the year 2036.
The government appears committed to carrying out the reform however, given the potential economic burden.
Turkey's social security deficit exceeded $19 billion, or 4% of GDP, in 2007.
In other news Sunday, Turkish border police seized 400kg of heroin found in a truck attempting to cross the border with Bulgaria.
Gendarmerie officers in Sakarya have been investigating a drug trafficking network for a couple of months that operated through an olive exporting company.
Officials say this stash was hidden in olive containers.

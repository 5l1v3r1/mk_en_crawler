ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou and Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu met in Athens on Tuesday (August 17th) to discuss ways to boost bilateral military ties, including sharing expertise and holding joint exercises.
Netanyahu said after the meeting that his visit, the first by an Israeli prime minister to Greece, marks the "opening of a new chapter".
Papandreou described the talks as "very productive".
When asked whether plans to establish a joint Israeli-Greek committee might create problems with neighbouring Turkey, he responded that "relations between Greece and Israel are not competitive with other bilateral or multilateral co-operation." During the visit, the two leaders and their wives took a symbolic ride to an island off Athens' coast aboard a Coast Guard vessel that Israel sold to Greece eight years ago.

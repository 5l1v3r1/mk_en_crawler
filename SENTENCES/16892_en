SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU said on Thursday (3 August) it is donating 3.8m euros to BiH's tourist industry, still struggling 11 years after the country's ethnic conflict.
The funds would be used to improve tourist infrastructure, strengthen tourist services, boost personnel skills and marketing and put up a network of signposts.
Official statistics suggest that the tourist occupancy rate currently stands at 14 per cent.

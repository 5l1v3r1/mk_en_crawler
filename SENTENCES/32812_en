PARIS, France -- Following a meeting Thursday (5 December) with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac proposed that Turkey's accession talks with the EU begin on 1 July 2005.
According to their scenario, the European Commission would prepare a report in 2004 on Ankara's progress in pursuing democratic reforms.
If the EU is satisfied, Turkey would be invited to start accession talks.
Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis immediately rejected the plan, and reiterated that Ankara wants to start talks in 2003.
He seeks a start date at next week's summit in Copenhagen.
In other news Thursday, the US State Department warned of possible terrorist attacks against US interests in southeast Turkey, expressing particular concern about travel through the airport in Gaziantep near the Syrian border.
The statement noted that the government in Ankara has taken steps to minimise the threat.

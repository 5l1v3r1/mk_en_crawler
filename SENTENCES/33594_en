BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister and Democratic Christian Party leader Vladan Batic said Monday (15 September) that it would be pointless to hold presidential elections in Serbia.
Batic said he had advised acting President Natasa Micic not to schedule elections, describing them as a waste of resources that would achieve no political results.
Batic, who also heads the constitutional commission, recently announced that the constitution would be subject to a national referendum on 15 February.
Micic has said she would wait for the document to be adopted before calling elections.

VIENNA, Austria -- Attending a seminar on Monday (2 December), Croatian EU Integration Minister Neven Mimica said Zagreb will attempt to submit an official application for EU membership as soon as possible. 
He urged EU members to speed up ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, paving the way to a quick start of accession talks. 
The Croatian government expects to achieve the status of an official EU candidate in the first half of next year, and then join Bulgaria and Romania in the next accession wave in 2007.

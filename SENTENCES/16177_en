TIRANA, Albania -- The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Prec Zogaj, and the Chinese ambassador to Tirana, Tian Changchun, met on Wednesday (17 May).
Their talks came amid strained ties over a case involving five Chinese Uighur Muslims, who were released recently from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay and given asylum in Albania.
China is seeking their extradition from Albania, claiming the five are terrorists, not political refugees.
Zogaj said he stressed during the meeting with Changchun that "Albania does not give shelter to terrorists" and that Washington has assured Tirana that the five are not terrorists.

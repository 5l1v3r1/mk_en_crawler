ANKARA, Turkey -- State Minister and chief negotiator with the EU Egemen Bagis said on Tuesday (July 7th) the issue of re-opening the Greek Orthodox Seminary on the island of Heybeliada (Halki in Greek) should be considered a domestic affair rather than a bilateral matter. 
"This is an obligation of Turkish authorities to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens," Bagis was quoted as saying. 
He called on Greece to make a similar gesture of good will by expanding the rights of its Turkish minority.
"Greece should take simultaneous steps to solve problems of ethnic Turks in Western Thrace," Bagis said. 
However, he stressed the Halki Seminary should not be linked to other bilateral issues, such as Cyprus. 
Greece and the EU have long demanded that Turkey re-open the seminary to show it respects the rights of its Christian minority. 
The Eastern Orthodox Church's only facility to train clergy in Turkey was closed in 1971.

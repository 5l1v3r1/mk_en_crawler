SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government approved a proposal Thursday (May 15th) to ease visa restrictions for certain groups of citizens from Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro.
The move stems from an agreement between the EU and countries in the Western Balkans that took effect in January.
The less onerous visa regime applies to children under six, students and professors, those travelling for educational purposes, businessmen, journalists, retirees, members of religious organisations and NGOs, some drivers and members of official government delegations.

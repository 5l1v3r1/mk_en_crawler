SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian Union for Integration (DUI) won more votes than its main rival, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), during Sunday's (June 15th) revote in 187 polling stations where major violations occurred in the June 1st snap elections. 
The vote was rerun in three electoral regions, mostly populated by ethnic Albanians. 
According to the State Election Commission, the DUI won 12.77% of the vote, giving it 18 seats in the new parliament, compared to 8.47% of the vote, or 13 seats, for the DPA. 
The For a Better Macedonia coalition, led by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, confirmed its victory by attracting 48.8% of the vote. 
The opposition SDSM won 23.65%. 
Turnout in the June 1st and Sunday's elections was 57.37%.
Sunday's revote went relatively calmly, unlike the June 1st vote, when election-related violence claimed one life and injured more than ten people. 
This time, there was a strong police presence at all polling stations.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As expected Friday (March 16th), Parliament voted to make Gergana Grancharova Bulgaria's new Minister of EU Affairs. 
Predecessor Meglena Kuneva left the post in December to become EU Commissioner on Consumer Protection. 
Earlier this week, Grancharova said that joining the European Schengen common border control and visa space is the country's top priority.

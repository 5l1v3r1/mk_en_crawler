SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- If BiH politicians do not agree on crucial police restructuring by September, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak reportedly will implement the Bonn powers to impose reforms. 
The reforms are key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, a process that has been stalled for months. 
Sources quoted in Monday's (July 16th) Dnevni Avaz say Lajcak views the Bonn powers, under which he can enact law and dismiss politicians, as a last resort, and plans to spend the next two months lobbying BiH politicians for a compromise.

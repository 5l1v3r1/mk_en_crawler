CAIRO, Egypt -- International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) General Director Mohamed ElBaradei warned on Monday (January 7th) that al-Qaeda terrorists may be preparing a nuclear or radioactive network involving possible radioactive materials trafficked from Romania, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
"An attack in a capital such as London or Cairo would be a nightmare worse than the September 11th attacks in the United States," ElBaradei said in an interview with the Cairo-based Al-Hayat newspaper.
He added that he has information that radioactive materials are being sent from countries in the former USSR and Eastern Europe, including from Romania.
In response, Romanian Intelligence Service spokesman Marius Bercaru told Mediafax, "Romanian intelligence services have no information of any al-Qaeda elements or branches expressing interest in purchasing radioactive materials from Romania." (Cotidianul - 08/01/08;

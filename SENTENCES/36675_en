SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and six police officers have been charged with the murder of six Pakistanis and an Indian in 2002, a government spokeswoman announced Saturday (1 May). 
According to local media, two of the suspects are former security generals. 
Police sources are quoted as saying that Boskovski asked a senior police official to find several foreigners who could be presented as Islamic fundamentalists.

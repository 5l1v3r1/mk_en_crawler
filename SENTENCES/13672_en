BERLIN, Germany -- Turkish expatriates should do more to better integrate themselves in German society, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said at the end of a three-day visit to Berlin on Sunday (20 November). 
He urged his compatriots to learn German and improve their knowledge of local laws and customs. 
At the same time, Gul cautioned the German government that the vast Turkish minority must not feel excluded.
In other news, Turkish police said Sunday that they detained 12 people in illegal demonstrations in Istanbul. 
Rallies took place in three districts, protesting recent events in the country's southeast, where seven people died and over 20 were injured in clashes between pro-Kurdish protestors and Turkish security forces.

ATHENS, Greece -- Truck owners are staging a rally Tuesday (September 21st) in front of the parliament building in Athens, where lawmakers will be debating a controversial bill that would open the trucking sector to competition. 
A vote is scheduled for Wednesday. 
Demonstrators can expect a heavy police presence, as well as prosecutors who will be looking to ensure no regulations on protests are being violated. 
Representatives of operators in the transport sector warn that if the bill passes, protests will escalate. 
The demonstrations, which entered their second week on Monday, have created chaos on roads across Greece, with truck owners using over 1,100 vehicles to block major highways around Athens and Thessaloniki.

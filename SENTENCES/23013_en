BUCHAREST, Romania -- US Ambassador to Romania Nicholas Taubman said his country is determined to strengthen its strategic partnership with Romania. 
In a statement marking the July 4th US Independence Day, Taubman said co-operation is not limited to the defence and military sectors, as US companies such as Ford and Emerson have opened factories in Romania this year. 
Taubman also congratulated Romanian authorities on their organisation of the NATO summit in Bucharest in April and thanked Romania for its contribution to international peacekeeping efforts.

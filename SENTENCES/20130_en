TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha confirmed on Thursday (August 16th) that local electricity prices would climb next year, but he promised that it will not impact household consumers or small businesses.
Visiting the northern town of Shkodra, Berisha said the price of electricity on world markets has doubled, necessitating an adjustment of local prices.
The Albanian Power Corporation announced on Wednesday a 57% price increase for all those who consume more than 400kwh per month.

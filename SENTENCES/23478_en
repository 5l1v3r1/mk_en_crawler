SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko has called for a meeting Thursday (June 25th) with leaders of the main political parties in the country.
Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats and Dragan Covic of the Croat Democratic Union of BiH confirmed their participation but Sulejman Tihic, head of the Party of Democratic Action, has declined.
He is protesting Dodik's nationalistic rhetoric and activities Tihic views as anti-Dayton Accord.
He skipped talks with Covic and Dodik on June 14th for the same reason.

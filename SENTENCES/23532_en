PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament was divided Thursday (January 29th) during a discussion of the government's efforts in 2008. 
Lawmakers from the ruling coalition described it as a year of economic and social progress, while the opposition painted it as a period of growing poverty and unemployment. 
Among his political successes, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci cited the growing number of countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence, the adoption of the constitution and state symbols, and the International Donors Conference held in Brussels last July. 
The opposition criticised the government for the time it took to establish key state institutions such as the foreign ministry, the diplomatic corps, the Intelligence Agency, the Kosovo Security Council and the Constitutional Court.

VIENNA, Austria -- The fourth round of negotiations on the decentralisation in Kosovo, an integral part of talks on Kosovo's future status, started on Thursday (4 May).
The Serbian and Kosovo Albanian delegations differ on the number of new Serbian municipalities that should be established.
The Kosovo Albanian side is proposing two new municipalities to be run by Serbs, while the Serbian representatives want ten new municipalities with significant autonomy and special ties to Belgrade.
Deputy UN special envoy Albert Rohan, chairman of the meeting, says Serbia's demand for a total of 16 Serbian municipalities in Kosovo is unacceptable.
The talks conclude on Friday.

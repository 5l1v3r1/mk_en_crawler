ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed the new law on the television and radio council Friday (10 June), saying the measure opened the door to politicisation of the council. 
In particular, he disagreed with the concept of parliament appointing council members nominated by parties, according to the number of seats held by those parties in parliament. 
Sezer argued that the new law would result in a media watchdog dependent on political parties.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The new Rehabilitation Law, approved by the Turkish Parliament earlier this month, aims at enhancing the principles of rule of law and human rights, according to Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu, who gave a press conference Thursday (7 August) to explain the new legislation.
Aksu said that about 450 fighters from extremist groups had sought amnesty under the provision of the new law.
The government expects the number of surrendering fighters to increase significantly in the coming days.
Officials in Ankara hope that the move would lead to the disbanding of the Kurdistan Worker's Party, which has been fighting the government for nearly two decades.
Meanwhile, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party, Deniz Baykal, said Thursday that the Rehabilitation Law brings the country one step closer to opening EU accession negotiations.

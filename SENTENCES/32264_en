SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sarajevo on Saturday (5 October) hosted the annual meeting of the Council of European Bishops' Conferences (CCEE). 
A key topic was the threat of new conflict between the United States and Iraq. 
The President of CCEE, the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Murphy O'Connor, commented that it was the Church's wish that the conflict be settled peacefully. 
He added that a new war might strain relations between Christianity and Islam and eventually transfer that conflict back to Europe. 
O'Connor noted that the existing ethnic and religious peace in BiH might serve as a good example.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul insisted on Thursday (3 March) that reforms have not slowed in Turkey. 
He was responding to remarks by the head of the European Commission's delegation to Turkey, Hansjorg Kretschmer, who said progress has slackened since the 17 December summit. 
Gul rejected the criticism, saying Turkey is aware of its obligations and is working to fulfil them.

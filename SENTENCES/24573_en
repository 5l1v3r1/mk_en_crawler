TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided late on Wednesday (May 6th) to grant NATO permission to patrol its airspace until the Albanian air force starts patrolling it on its own.
Parliament is expected to adopt the measure soon, without objections from the opposition.
Albania joined NATO in early April.

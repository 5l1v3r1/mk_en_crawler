THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- At a press conference Friday (17 March), UN war crimes tribunal President Judge Fausto Pocar said preliminary results of toxicology tests show "no indication" that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was poisoned. 
He explained that traces of prescribed medicine were found, but not in a quantity that would be toxic. 
The tribunal's Trial Chamber has lifted some confidentiality provisions in the case against Milosevic, in order to assist investigations into his death Saturday at The Hague.
Meanwhile, small crowds of supporters, many of them elderly people, have been turning out to pay their last respects to Milosevic in Belgrade. 
The two-day public viewing in a museum ends Friday, with burial Saturday in his hometown of Pozarevac.

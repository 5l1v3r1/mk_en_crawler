TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian Army has adopted a defensive stance, foregoing offensive capabilities, a military spokesman said Monday (29 November).
His comments followed a military parade in Tirana, which commemorated the 60th anniversary of Albania's liberation from Nazi occupation.
A squadron of old MiG fighters flew overhead in what was described as their final mission before being retired from service.
In his address marking the occasion, Prime Minister Fatos Nano said the country's armed forces are closer to NATO than ever before.
In other news Monday, the Albanian Daily News reported that Austria has reaffirmed its support for Albania's EU integration efforts.
The statement of support came during a meeting between Nano and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel at last week's Central European Initiative summit.

TIRANA, Albania -- The prospect of EU membership remains a major incentive for reforms and regional stability, according to participants at the Central European Initiative's (CEI) economic conference, which wrapped up in Tirana on Friday (November 24th). 
The event, attended by some 900 government officials and business leaders from 18 Central and Southeast European states, focused primarily on economic ties, technical co-operation in the fields of infrastructure, energy, transport, small- and medium-sized enterprises and human resources, as well as combating organised crime and corruption. 
At the two-day meeting, Bulgaria assumed the rotating CEI presidency from Albania.

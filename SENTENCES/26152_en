THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving an 11-year sentence in a Swedish prison for her role in war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 conflict, will be released early, The Hague war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (September 15th). 
Tribunal President Patrick Robinson said in a decision on Monday that she should be released "notwithstanding the gravity of her crimes". 
Plavsic, 79, has served two-thirds of her sentence, and under Swedish law, could be freed as early as October 27th. 
She was sentenced in 2003 after pleading guilty to a single count of persecution, a crime against humanity, as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive Muslims and Croats out of Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia.

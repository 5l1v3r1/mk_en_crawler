SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The defence ministry and the army's general staff are refusing to withdraw army patrols from checkpoints in the northern villages of Tanushevci, Brest and Malina.
Ethnic Albanians living there threatened civil unrest on Saturday (12 April) over the patrols and because local self-governance has not yet been established.
In other news, the State Anti-Corruption Commission announced Friday that it will file charges against 70 state officials who failed to submit the required property declarations.
According to Commission President Slagjana Taseva, most are members of steering boards of state enterprises.
Meanwhile, on Sunday, Finance Minister Petar Gosev predicted the IMF Board will approve the stand-by arrangement for Macedonia on 30 April.
IMF and World Bank satisfaction with ongoing economic policy will likely result in the disbursement of another $80m in donor funding in the next two months, Gosev added.

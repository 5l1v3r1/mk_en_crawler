SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A journalist from the Utrinski Vesnik daily newspaper was arrested late Friday (June 20th) for at least two murders in the town of Kicevo over the past two months. 
Police say reporter Vlado Taneski, 56, raped and tortured his victims. 
Taneski, who covered criminal cases, wrote detailed accounts of the murders and the ensuing trial of two men arrested for them. 
Though they insisted they were innocent, both were sentenced to life in prison. 
Police began looking at the reporter after he detailed information on one case that only investigators knew about. 
Two women who remain missing were also likely killed by the journalist.

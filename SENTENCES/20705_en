LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Parliament members ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Montenegro and the EU on Thursday (February 7th), making Slovenia the second EU member state to endorse the document, after Estonia.
The accord must be approved by the parliaments of every member in the bloc, a process that could take two to four years.
Also Thursday, Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen arrived for a two-day visit to Ljubljana at the invitation of Slovene counterpart Dimitrij Rupel.
They sealed an agreement on technical assistance in EU integration.
Slovenia has made the accelerated integration of the Western Balkan countries a main priority of its ongoing EU presidency.

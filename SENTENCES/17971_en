SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Wrapping up a two-day session in Sarajevo on Tuesday (June 19th), the Peace Implementation Council's (PIC) Steering Board criticised BiH party leaders for failing to push through key reforms regarding the new constitution and police restructuring, and for using aggressive rhetoric.
The PIC board again cautioned that the stalemate threatens BiH's economic prospects and has delayed the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
PIC members also rejected recent rhetoric suggesting competencies should be returned from the state level to the entities.

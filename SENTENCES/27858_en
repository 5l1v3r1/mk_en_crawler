ANKARA, Turkey -- The government has decided to remove Russia, Iran, Iraq and Greece from a list of countries deemed threats to Turkey's national security, the Milliyet reported on Monday (August 23rd), citing anonymous sources.
According to the newspaper, the decision to update the so-called Red Book of countries representing security threats will be adopted at a session of the National Security Council in October.
Thus, the four will no longer be described as "threats" but as allies based on co-operation and a "shared vision".
The last Red Book revision was in 2005.
In other news, the lawyer representing a freelance US journalist arrested in Istanbul in mid-August for alleged ties to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) said on Monday that his client was deported to the United States on Friday.
Jake Hess, 25, a freelance writer from New Hampshire, was reporting on the mistreatment of Kurds and was working as a translator for a human rights organisation in Diyarbakir.

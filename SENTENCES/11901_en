SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU security chief Javier Solana's spokesperson, Cristina Gallach, said Tuesday (17 May) that the EU is disappointed with the failure of BiH leaders to reach an agreement on crucial police reform. 
The statement followed the suspension of political negotiations, which were blocked due to Republika Srpska's objection to the suggested mapping of future police regions. 
Gallach said that the restructuring of the BiH police sector was the major condition for BiH's EU integration, and stressed that it would remain so in the period ahead.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown said that EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told him the European Commission would certainly not approve BiH's bid to start talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement under the current circumstances. 
Ashdown added, however, that there was an opportunity to change the situation and fulfil the set criteria by Thursday, when the EU assessment mission is expected to arrive in Sarajevo.
Also Tuesday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic warned Security Minister Barisa Colak and Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic that they must resolve the deadlock concerning the appointment of new management at the State Investigation and Protection Agency by 23 May. 
Local press cited Terzic as saying that he would consider "radical" measures to tackle the lack of responsibility toward the issue.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutor-General Boris Velchev will officially ask parliament to lift the immunity of former Interior Minister Rumen Petkov, according to sources cited by the newspaper Sega on Saturday (May 17th).
The prosecutor's office wants to indict Petkov for revealing the identity of someone helping the National Security Agency (NSA) a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.
While interior minister, Petkov revealed the identity of a former police officer, who was secretly assisting the NSA, believing that parliament's committee on homeland security already knew about it.
It turns out, the panel did not.
Since he remains a member of parliament from the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party, Petkov has immunity against criminal investigation.
Velchev must file an official request with parliament to lift that immunity.

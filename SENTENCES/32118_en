ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has abandoned its demand for amendments in the law on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. 
Party whip Vladimir Seks said Monday (14 October) that HDZ does not want to obstruct the government in its dispute with the tribunal. 
He added that when they asked for changes last Friday, they were not aware that tribunal chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte was about to visit Zagreb. 
The Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) also withdrew its motion for a moratorium on co-operation with the tribunal. 
The HSLS had suggested imposing a moratorium until the committee on the constitution stated that indictments against Gen Rahim Ademi and Gen Ante Gotovina are legal.
In other news, Prime Minister Ivica Racan welcomed a decision by the UN tribunal to form a five-member panel to examine Croatia's two appeals against the indictment of retired Gen Janko Bobetko. 
Racan met with the 83 year old general on Monday, reportedly trying to convince him to enter a plea in Zagreb and remain in Croatia until the start of his trial.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias said on Tuesday (February 9th) that he will continue talks aimed at uniting the island, despite criticism from his former coalition partner, the Movement for Social Democracy (KS-EDEK). 
The party accuses him of making strategic mistakes in talks with the Turkish Cypriots. 
The KS-EDEK announced on Monday that it is leaving the ruling coalition over "concessions" made by Christofias. 
He responded on television, saying: "We are not so close to a solution as some would suggest both here and abroad, but we are working for a solution and this process is ongoing. 
No one can pre-judge the outcome." (Cyprus Mail - 10/02/10; Xinhua, Reuters - 09/02/10)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chief Prosecutor Marinko Jurcevic announced on Friday (October 6th) the opening of a probe against former Bosniak military commander Atif Dudakovic and several others suspected of war crimes.
The investigation was launched on the basis of charges submitted by Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik in August, after regional media broadcast video footage and photos allegedly showing crimes committed by the former Bosniak Army's 5th Corps, led by Dudakovic.
The victims were ethnic Serb civilians in the Krajina region.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US citizen David Schwendiman, who assumed office as BiH chief war crimes prosecutor on Thursday (November 29th), said that over 312 cases involving 894 peoples are being investigated right now.
The BiH war crimes chamber, established in 2005 to take over lower profile cases from the UN war crimes tribunal, has already issued 40 indictments.
Prosecutors estimate there are 16,150 people still at large, suspected of participating in atrocities during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Also Thursday, the BiH State Investigation and Protection Agency arrested 63-year-old Bosnian Serb Rade Veselinovic for war crimes.
Detained near the Bosnian Serb wartime stronghold of Pale, he is suspected of committing war crimes against civilians in the Sarajevo suburb of Hadzici, 15 years ago.

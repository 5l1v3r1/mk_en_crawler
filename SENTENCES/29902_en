NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The main opposition right-wing Democratic Rally (DISY) party came out on top in Sunday's (May 22nd) parliamentary elections with 34.27% of the votes, according to official results. 
The ruling leftist AKEL party of President Demetris Christofias was second with 32.67%, followed by the government coalition partner DIKO with 15.77%. 
There was a significant number of abstentions -- 21.32% -- which local media describe as an "unprecedented development" in a country where voting is compulsory. 
The elections were seen as a test of public confidence in Christofias and his policies.

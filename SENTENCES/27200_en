BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) green-lighted on Wednesday (September 30th) the opening of six negotiating chapters and the closure of another five in Croatia's accession talks. 
They are scheduled to resume Friday at an intergovernmental conference. 
Earlier, Slovenia's EU affairs parliamentary committee backed a government initiative for concluding an arbitration agreement with Croatia, which would settle the long-standing border dispute between the two countries.

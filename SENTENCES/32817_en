SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU plans to initiate a new round of talks on implementation of the Ohrid peace accord, EU spokesperson for Macedonia Irena Guzelova announced Wednesday (4 December).
President Boris Trajkovski agreed to the idea during a meeting in Brussels earlier this week with EU security chief Javier Solana.
Guzelova says that the EU has already approached the four signatories - VMRO-DPMNE, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, the Democratic Party of Albanians, and the Party of Democratic Prosperity - with the proposal.
Still unclear is whether the Democratic Union for Integration will participate.
In other news, parliament voted Wednesday to dismiss state public prosecutor Stavre Dzikov for what deputies described as his incompetent and irresponsible handling of cases from last year's ethnic Albanian insurgency.
They cited bias in his decision to issue arrest warrants to dozens of former guerrillas who had been granted amnesty.

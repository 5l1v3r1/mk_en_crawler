BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Reuters reported Friday (4 October) that the European Commission (EC) is going to recommend 2007 as the date for Bulgaria and Romania to enter the EU. 
The date will likely be announced in the Commission's annual report on accession countries, expected Wednesday. 
However, the EC is unlikely to set specific dates for concluding the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, as this would depend on the efforts of the two governments.
Bulgaria's parliament and cabinet welcomed the announcement, saying that efforts to meet EU accession criteria finally have borne fruit. 
The two institutions have been at odds over closing the older units of the Kozloduy nuclear plant in a bid to appease the EC.
Romania also reacted very positively to the announcement, especially after opening negotiations on the Agriculture chapter, deemed the most difficult topic. 
However, Romanian authorities said they regretted a statement by Bulgaria's Minister of European Affairs Meglena Kuneva, who wants Sofia considered separately from Romania.

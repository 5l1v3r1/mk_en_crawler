SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A runoff vote is under way Sunday (10 April) in eight municipalities and Skopje City.
In the capital, the race to watch is for mayor.
Incumbent Risto Penov tried to quit the race last week, but the amended election law did not allow for such a late withdrawal.
Penov faces opposition-backed businessman Trifun Kostovski.
During the previous rounds on 13 March and 27 March, a series of irregularities prompted strong criticism from the international community.
Revoting is also being held in several other municipalities where irregularities were observed in earlier rounds.
On Thursday, British Ambassador to Macedonia Robert Dickson said the conduct of elections must improve, or the country's efforts to join Euro-Atlantic structures could be affected.

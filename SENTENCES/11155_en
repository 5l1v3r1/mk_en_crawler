LONDON, United Kingdom -- Britain is drawing contingency plans to send additional troops and advisers to Kosovo to deal with any potential threat of violence, the Independent reported Monday (27 June). 
Experts and the Kosovo government are worried that unrest could accompany the start of talks -- widely expected in autumn, depending on the outcome of a UN review -- on the province's final status. 
British soldiers have been dispatched to Kosovo on short missions during elections and other events. 
Britian has 200 soldiers in the province and 1,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

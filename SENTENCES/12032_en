SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Sunday's local elections were marred by "significant irregularities" in certain areas, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday (14 March). 
While noting that in most areas, the elections complied with international standards, he urged the government to investigate and prosecute those responsible for violations. 
The OSCE joined the criticism, citing "serious and persistent irregularities in a significant number of municipalities". 
The organisation's 60 monitors reported problems in 20 per cent of the polling stations, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. 
Critics want the problems corrected before the second round of voting on 27 March.
In terms of preliminary results, the State Election Commission says 16 mayors were elected in round one. 
Still unclear however is the winner of the high profile race in Skopje. 
Early reports had incumbent Risto Penov losing to opposition-backed independent candidate Trifun Kostovski, who claims to have received 58 per cent of the vote.

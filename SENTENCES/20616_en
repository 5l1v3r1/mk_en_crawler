ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) decided on Tuesday (October 9th) to seek parliament's authorisation for a raid into Iraq, following recent attacks on Turkish troops by members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
The decision was made during a meeting of party leaders and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
PKK ambushes have killed at least 15 Turkish soldiers since the weekend. 
Both the United States and the Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq have urged Ankara to show restraint.

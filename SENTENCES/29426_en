PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Workers at an aluminium factory owned by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska stormed the plant late Thursday (April 29th) and tossed out managers to protest recent job cuts.
The protestors insist that the plant should be returned to the hands of the Montenegrin government.
On Friday, after talks with the protestors, Russian managers of the KAP plant agreed to annul the decision to fire 42 workers.
Privatised by Deripaska in 2006, the plant has been forced to cut production by half and slash many of the 2,100 jobs amid the global financial crisis.

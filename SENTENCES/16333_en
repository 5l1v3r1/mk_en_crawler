BELGRADE, Serbia -- Rasim Ljajic, chairman of Serbia's national council for co-operation with the UN tribunal, said on Thursday (10 August) that the government's action plan for arresting the top indictee Ratko Mladic is already showing results.
He said it is "having positive effects in the sense of better co-ordination of security services that now work together" in the search for Mladic.
Ljajic and Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic are in charge of the plan.
Belgrade hopes implementing it will spur the EU to resume Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks, suspended earlier this year over the Mladic case.

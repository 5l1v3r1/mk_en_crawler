ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic responded on Wednesday (7 June) to a statement by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who said Croatia would be next to join the EU after Bulgaria and Romania, but not before 2010. 
Mesic argued that EU accession depends entirely on the fulfillment of membership criteria and not on what EU officials say. 
He expressed full confidence the country would be ready to enter the Union this decade, insisting that the target date of 2009 remains viable.

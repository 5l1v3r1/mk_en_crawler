TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha has launched a campaign to sack chief prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, accusing him of links to organised crime and of protecting suspected members of such circles, according to local press reports Monday (17 April).
Berisha said publicly Sunday that the ruling Democratic Party had evidence proving Sollaku's involvement in crimes and corruption.
Sollaku dismissed the allegations as "dirty slanders", noting that in the past two years, prosecutors had smashed 26 criminal groups.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government marked World Food Day on Sunday (19 October) by organising a mass breakfast for nearly 39,000 people.
Polenta, yogurt and apples were served in main squares, primary schools, retirement homes, kindergarten and army barracks.
Organisers hope that the event will end up in the Guinness Book of Records.
The current record-holder is Taiwan, which staged a breakfast for 23,291 people two years ago.

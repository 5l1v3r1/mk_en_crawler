SKOPJE, Macedonia -- All accredited journalists boycotted Thursday's (September 27th) government press conference to protest physical assaults on their colleagues inside parliament and by police earlier this week. 
On Tuesday, A1 TV journalist Lirim Dulovi was roughed up by bodyguards of lawmakers from the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI). 
Later in the day, police beat an Alsat TV crewmember who was trying to film them as they searched the car of two DUI MPs.
In a statement issued Thursday, US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic deplored the attacks on the journalists. 
"This practice threatens the very foundation of democracy. 
We strongly condemn the unconscionable physical attack on a journalist. 
We reiterate that violence, threats and intimidation have no place in the democratic process." (MIA, Makfax, MRT, A1 TV - 27/09/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two of the UN war crimes tribunal's most-wanted indictees -- Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic -- are hiding in Republika Srpska, the daily Dnevni avaz reported on Tuesday (14 December), citing an official with the BiH state intelligence agency. 
The newspaper also reported that talks on potential surrender were recently held with both indictees. 
The negotiations are said to have involved Serbian and RS representatives.
Meanwhile, the local press continues to speculate about whether another indictee, former Bosnian Serb army General Vinko Pandurovic, will agree to surrender to RS authorities. 
Reports say he is in custody in Serbia.

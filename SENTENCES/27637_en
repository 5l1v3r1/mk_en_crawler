LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- EU foreign ministers reaffirmed at their meeting on Monday (October 25th) the European perspective of the western Balkan countries.
They recalled that each country will be assessed based on its own merits and whether it meets the criteria of its EU integration process.
The foreign ministers also voiced support for the upcoming dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and backed visa liberalisation for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania.
In addition, they urged BiH political leaders to engage in constructive dialogue and form new governments that will work to bring the country closer to the EU, while abstaining from divisive rhetoric.

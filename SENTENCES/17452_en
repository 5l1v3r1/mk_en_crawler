SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During a farewell ceremony at EUFOR headquarters near Sarajevo on Tuesday (June 26th), EUFOR Commander Hans-Jochen Witthauer awarded outgoing High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling the EU Meritorious Medal. 
Witthauer said it acknowledged Schwarz-Schilling's contributions to BiH and the region. 
Slovak diplomat Miroslav Lajcak succeeds him on Monday.
In separate statement Tuesday, Schwarz-Schilling explained his decision to enact the Law on the Centre for the Srebrenica-Potocari Memorial and Cemetery, which transfers the administration of the centre to the state government. 
Schwarz-Schilling denied accusations by Republika Srpska's (RS) political leaders, who say it violates the Dayton Peace Accord. 
RS government special co-ordinator for Srebrenica Miladin Dragicevic resigned on Tuesday over the move.

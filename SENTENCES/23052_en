SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Opposition parties may file another motion of no-confidence against the cabinet Thursday (April 3rd), following consultations among the parties Wednesday.
At issue is a scandal at the interior ministry over leaks of sensitive information to organised crime circles.
The opposition Bulgarian New Democracy party insists that the whole government should resign.
The Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria say that the no-confidence motion is necessary to protect Bulgaria's image abroad.
The no-confidence motion would be the fifth against the government of Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev.

"Turkey is not ...
renegotiating anything.
If you impose new things on countries from one day to the next, especially at a time when negotiations are about to start, that would not be right.
We are used to honest politics, that's what we expect and want," he said in response to calls by some in Europe for the adoption of a tougher stance on Ankara's bid.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- KFOR personnel on Wednesday (28 April) arrested a former senior guerrilla commander on suspicion of involvement in the wave of violence that swept the province last month.
Sami Lushtaku, an ethnic Albanian, was arrested in northern Kosovo, KFOR spokesman Jim Moran told the Beta news agency.
Moran said that Lushtaku, a founder of the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army, was arrested in connection with rioting in mid-March in which 19 people died and thousands of Serbs were driven from their homes.
He stressed that the decision to detain Lushtaku was unrelated to his actions as a commander of the guerrilla army in clashes with Serb security forces in 1998 and 1999.

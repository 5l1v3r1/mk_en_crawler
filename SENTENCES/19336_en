BRDO PRI KRANJU, Slovenia -- Following a two day meeting in Slovenia, EU foreign ministers vowed to proceed with the integration of the Western Balkans. 
"It is in the interest of Western Balkan countries to continue as quickly as possible with the process of political and economic reforms, reconciliation and protection of ethnic minorities and with making progress towards the EU," the ministers said in a statement Saturday (March 29th). 
Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said the EU states have agreed to step up implementation of the Thessaloniki agenda, a strategy for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, invited for the first time to attend the meeting of EU foreign ministers along with his counterparts from the Western Balkans, said he believed all EU member states would recognise Kosovo shortly. 
He also suggested relations with Serbia could change after the May 11th general elections there.
The meeting also signaled a thaw in relations between Serbia and the EU. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic spoke at the forum, insisting that Kosovo and the EU integration should be considered separate issues. 
He said Serbia would be ready to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and that war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic could be arrested "in the very near future".

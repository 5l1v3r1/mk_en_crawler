ATHENS, Greece -- The government said on Monday (August 30th) that a group of Iranian men have been granted refugee status after staging a hunger strike to protest the delays in processing their applications.
The six, two of whom had been on hunger strike since July 19th, have been given political asylum.
They were camping in front of the UN refugee agency office in Athens, arguing that their asylum applications have dragged on for up to nine years.

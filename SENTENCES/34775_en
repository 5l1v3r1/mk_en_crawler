BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU membership would bring considerable economic and commercial changes to Romania, Trade Minister-delegate Eugen Dijmarescu told Radio Free Europe on Monday (11 August). 
He said that as an EU member, Romania would be transformed from a beneficiary of preferential trade tariffs to a provider of such tariffs to other countries. 
Noting that the structure of Romanian exports would alter significantly, Dijmarescu urged companies to take measures to prepare for EU competitive pressures.

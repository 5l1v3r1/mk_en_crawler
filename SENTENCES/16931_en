SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Croat Zdravko Mihaljevic, who is charged with war crimes, has surrendered to BiH prosecutors, his lawyer confirmed on Thursday (3 August). 
Mihaljevic, also known as Pijuk, was commander of the Croatian Defence Council's (HVO) special unit "Maturica". 
He is accused of crimes against Bosniak civilians in Kiseljak and Kresevo.
In other news Thursday, the UN tribunal at The Hague announced that it is allowing more time for the transfer of Bosnian Croat war crimes suspect Pasko Ljubicic, whose case was handed over to the BiH court in April. 
Ljubicic was to be extradited to BiH this week, but that has been extended now to 18 August. 
The former commander of the HVO's 4th Military Police Battalion is charged with crimes against Bosniak civilians in the Lasva valley in January-July 1993.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The year begins with a high level of corruption within all institutions, the director of the Anti-Corruption Agency, Hasan Preteni, said on Monday (January 3rd). 
He noted that corruption has reached alarming levels despite promises to fight it in 2010. 
"We have been hoping that the institutions will do more to fight the phenomenon, but we got cheated by their promises," Preteni said. 
Political parties were classified as the most corrupt in 2010 by a poll conducted by the UNDP, followed by the judiciary system. 
Preteni accused the judiciary of failing to process cases presented by his agency.
Avni Zogiani, head of the anti-corruption organisation Cohu, concurs, saying that all reports on corruption suggest the situation is aggravated. 
He accused the government of interfering with the judiciary.

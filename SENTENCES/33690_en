TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities invited the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna to be one of the monitors of local elections scheduled for 12 October. 
The foreign ministry announced that Albania's ambassador to the OSCE, Zef Mazi, has already briefed the Permanent Council. 
The OSCE has played a key role in the past, both by monitoring votes and by advising afterwards. 
President Alfred Moisiu has described the elections as "Albania's passport in its road of integration".

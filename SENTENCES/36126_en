BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian democratic forces are to meet this week to discuss the possibility of nominating a joint presidential candidate. 
"It's logical that we put forward one candidate, and that that candidate wins," said New Serbia leader Velimir Ilic on Monday (15 March). 
Vojislav Kostunica, the prime minister and leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, is unlikely to run for the post despite initial rumours.

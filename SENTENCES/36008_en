English added that Washington would help BiH meet the conditions for PfP membership, including the establishment of a fully operational defence ministry at the state level.
In other news, OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy called on BiH to press ahead with reforms in the defence and education sectors. 
Meeting with a number of BiH and international officials, Passy stressed that BiH must meet its obligations to ensure future membership in Euro-Atlantic structures.

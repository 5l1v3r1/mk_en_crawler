BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the Serbian national council for ties with the UN tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Wednesday (July 4th) that chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will be submitting a new proposal to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, which would allow war crimes convicts to serve prison terms in their countries of origin. 
Ljajic says the change would encourage remaining fugitives to surrender.
Also Wednesday, the tribunal announced that del Ponte will visit Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia next week to discuss co-operation related issues.

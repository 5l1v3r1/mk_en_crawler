BELGRADE, Serbia -- Speaking on national TV RTS, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica warned on Monday (3 July) that democratic forces would not be able to prevent radicalisation if there are further delays in negotiations with the EU and if Kosovo becomes independent. 
He also said the idea of preparing an action plan for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal should have been raised with the EU before talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement were halted.

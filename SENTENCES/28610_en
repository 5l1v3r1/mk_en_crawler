SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Friday (August 13th) marks the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the document that codified Macedonia's inter-ethnic existence and European integration.
The EU delegation, NATO's headquarters in Skopje, the OSCE Spillover Monitor Mission to Skopje and the US Embassy issued a joint statement Thursday to mark the occasion.
It read in part "the Agreement and relevant constitutional provisions remain indispensible to building a peaceful, just and cohesive multiethnic society." It also urged additional efforts "in the fields of equitable representation, decentralisation and education".
Both the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and main opposition SDSM said they remain committed to the Agreement and its implementation.

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) presented a no-confidence motion against Parliamentary Speaker Jozefina Topalli on Wednesday (November 24th). 
Topalli is accused of poor performance in doing her job, resulting in failure to adopt laws and frequent clashes with the Constitutional Court. 
The motion also blames Topalli of running a politicised parliament that does not function as an independent institution and does not exert any pressure against the executive. 
Reacting to the motion, Topalli said that she will respect the constitution and will defeat the opposition in any motion they present.

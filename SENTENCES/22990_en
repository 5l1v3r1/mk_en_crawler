BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS) rejected statements by outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who said that Serbia's newly signed Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU contains a clause requesting Serbia give up a part of its territory, a reference to Kosovo.
Kostunica, leader of the rival Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), should "stop untruths, slander, lies and usage of vocabulary that is not appropriate, considering the office he currently holds", the DS said in a statement Saturday (May 3rd).
The two parties and many others, face off in parliamentary and local elections on May 11th.
In other news Saturday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Serbia is using Kosovo as an excuse for cultivating close ties with Moscow, rather than Brussels.
During a lecture at the University of Oxford, Rehn characterised this as a "dangerous game", warning that Serbia would be the first to experience negative consequences, should Kosovo's fragile economy fail.

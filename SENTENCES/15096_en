ANKARA, Turkey -- Achieving membership in the EU is a goal of Turkey's state policy, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Saturday (30 July), adding that it would help bring the country up to the level of the advanced nations and improve the living standards of people. 
Referring to the government's decision to extend a customs treaty with the EU to the Union's new 10 members, including Cyprus, he reiterated that the move does not constitute formal recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. 
He also pledged further efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue with help from the UN. 
Separately, Economy Minister Ali Babacan, who is in charge of talks with the EU, said that by extending the customs union, Turkey has met the last condition for starting accession talks with the European Commission on 3 October. 
The document will now have to be ratified by the EU's 25 members.
In other news, local media are reporting that EC Ambassador to Turkey Hansjoerg Kretschmer has criticised the continued influence of the Turkish military on the government. 
Speaking at a business dinner late last week, Kretschmer reportedly indicated it could be a problem during accession talks. 
A three-day meeting of the Turkish Supreme Military Council began in Ankara on Monday. 
The panel, chaired by the prime minister, includes the defence minister and members of the Turkish armed forces' command. 
It meets twice a year.

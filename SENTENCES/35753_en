BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A member of Serbia's Radical Party suspected of committing war crimes in Croatia during the 1991-1995 war has surrendered to a court in Novi Sad, an investigating magistrate announced Sunday (1 February). 
Milan Lancuzanin commanded a paramilitary unit in Vukovar where Serb forces executed nearly 200 Croats in November 1991.
In other news, KFOR issued a statement saying that two ethnic Albanians -- Avdil Jakupi, better known as Commander Chakala, and Adnan Abazi -- have surrendered and have been handed over to UNMIK. 
Both are suspected of ties to with the Albanian National Army, a shadowy group that has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Macedonia, Kosovo and southern Serbia.

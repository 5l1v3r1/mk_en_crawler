SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian Ambassador to BiH Grujica Spasovic has received an anonymous e-mail insisting he leave Sarajevo within 48 hours or die, BiH media reported on Friday (March 7th).
The message cites the genocide in Srebrenica and other towns where Bosniaks were killed during the 1990s.
It was signed by an organisation calling itself "Union of Young Muslims".
A similar threat was sent to a senior official with Serb air carrier JAT in BiH, Stana Radovic.
The Bosnian Agency for Investigation and Protection has traced the emails to Denmark.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Local television aired footage Thursday (October 4th) of several masked men who claimed they were members of a volunteer militia that is prepared to fight for Kosovo's independence. 
The men said they were part of the Albanian National Army (ANA), a shadowy group that emerged during the conflict in Macedonia in 2001. 
They said they were concerned about reports that a Serb militia had been formed to fight Kosovo's independence and about threats by Serb officials that Belgrade might send armed forces into the province.
After the footage aired on Radio Television of Kosovo, Prime Minister Agim Ceku said the ANA was sending a troubling message to the international community. 
President Fatmir Seidiu said the public should know they do not need militias to protect them. 
Serbian President Boris Tadic issued a statement urging Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders to denounce ANA's threat of violence.

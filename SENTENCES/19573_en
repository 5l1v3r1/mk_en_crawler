ANKARA, Turkey -- US Vice President Dick Cheney expressed support on Monday (March 24th) for Turkey's fight against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. 
According to a Reuters report, which cited an anonymous US official, he also called for the PKK problem to be addressed in a way that does not increase political tensions in Iraq.
Cheney, who stopped in Ankara for six hours after completing a Mideast tour, met with President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and General Yasar Buyukanit, the chief of Turkey's general staff. 
Turkish officials said the talks covered a number of issues, including the PKK, exchanges of intelligence between Ankara and Washington, the situation in Afghanistan, the Iranian nuclear crisis, and energy issues. 
Ankara reportedly ruled out sending more troops to Afghanistan for the time being.

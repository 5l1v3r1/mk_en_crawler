PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Helsinki Committee presented a report in Pristina on Monday (September 22nd) dubbed "Forgotten World of the Serb Enclaves" that criticises Serbian and Russian policies towards Kosovo.
The report, based on seven months of research conducted in co-operation with the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, says propaganda in support of Kosovo's partitioning explains why Kosovo Serbs look to Belgrade for guidance rather than to Pristina.
The document also concludes that freedom of movement is no longer a problem for Kosovo Serbs.
Instead, the community faces issues related to unemployment and health concerns, which are shared by Kosovo Albanians.
In other news, 50 new international staff joined the EULEX mission at the weekend.
"These new arrivals will be followed by 100 new ones per week," Yves de Kermabon, the head of the mission, said on Monday.
However, the state secretary in the Serbian Ministry for Kosovo, Oliver Ivanovic, ruled out the deployment of EULEX judges to courts in Serb-dominated areas.
He predicted talks between Belgrade and UNMIK would end with Serb and other judges remaining at their posts in accordance with UNMIK regulations.

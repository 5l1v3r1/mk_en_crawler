Croatia's Interior Ministry has announced the results of an international police action aimed at breaking up an Internet child pornography ring. 
Out of 225 people apprehended so far, eight were Croatians. 
As many as 2,000 users of pornographic material are likely to be arrested, the ministry says.
Meanwhile, police are also attempting to establish the identity of a 12-year-old girl who was sexually abused and videotaped in Croatia. 
These and other actions are part of government efforts to crack down on computer-related crimes, as required by the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty.
The treaty, ratified by Croatia in 2001, went into effect on 1 July. 
It calls for participating nations to update their laws to reflect crimes such as distribution of child pornography, unauthorised intrusions into networks, the release of worms and viruses, and copyright infringement. 
Albania, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania are among the other nations that have ratified the treaty, which includes arrangements for mutual assistance and extradition.
The Croatian Interior Ministry established a computer crime department in 2003, in response to a 15 per cent annual rise in this type of criminal activity. 
Officials note that because cybercrime crosses national borders, fighting it requires co-operation with the police of other countries.
"The latest case we made public shows that this co-operation is more than good, and it is certain that with time, it will only get better. 
The international dimension of this problem requires such an approach," said the computer crime department's deputy chief, Ognjen Hramin. 
"Above all, this refers to measures and actions defined by the Convention on Cybercrime, which will raise this co-operation and its results to an even higher level."

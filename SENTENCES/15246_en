SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The United States and Bulgaria announced on Tuesday (27 June) plans for upgrading military facilities in the Balkan country. 
In April, Washington and Sofia signed an agreement to share three bases in Bulgaria. 
Bulgarian Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov and US Ambassador John Beyrle told reporters that the upgrades would cost tens of millions of dollars. 
US experts are to visit the southern airfield of Bezmer to draw up plans for the project.
Beylre said Bulgaria would benefit from the bases as they will translate into improved infrastructure, more jobs for local residents, and increased consumer spending as a result of the presence of several thousand US troops. 
Bulgarian businesses will also get an opportunity to compete for acquisitions contracts for the bases.

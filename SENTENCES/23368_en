ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the local elections Sunday (March 29th), though its public support seems to have dropped to the lowest level ever during the AKP's period in power.
According to results released early Monday, with 97% of the votes counted, the AKP gained 38.99% of votes for provincial councils, down from 46.6% in the 2007 general elections.
The ruling party held onto its mayoral seats in Istanbul and Ankara, but it lost key cities such as Izmir, Adana and Diyarbakir.
The opposition parties did better than before.
The main opposition Republican People's Party won 23.22% of votes for provincial councils, up from 20.88% in the 2007 general elections.
Support for the far-right opposition Nationalist Movement Party also jumped significantly to 16.13%.
The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party won 7.26% of votes nationwide, mostly in the Kurdish-dominated southeastern provinces.
In his first statements after the results, Erdogan voiced dissatisfaction with the outcome, describing the results as "a lesson" for the AKP, which he said would learn from its mistakes.
He also signalled a cabinet shuffle is possible.
Meanwhile, clashes marred the election process in several southeastern provinces, including Sanliurfa, Diyarbakir, Kars, Van and Kayseri.
At least six people died and around 100 suffered injuries in fighting that erupted among supporters of rival candidates.

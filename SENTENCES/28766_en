BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said on Saturday (September 11th) that Brussels is ready to host groundbreaking talks between Serbia and Kosovo. 
"It's for the two parties, for Serbia and Kosovo to decide who and how and when. 
I have offered that we would be very happy to facilitate those talks, to host them here," Ashton said after an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also said on Saturday that his organisation is ready "to contribute to these efforts, in close co-operation with the EU". 
On Thursday, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution sponsored by Serbia and the 27 EU members, calling for direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina. 
The move came after Serbia agreed to amend an earlier draft which had called for resuming negotiations on status.

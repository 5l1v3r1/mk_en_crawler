SKOPJE, Macedonia -- As expected, Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski has scheduled parliamentary elections on 5 July, according to a press release issued Thursday (20 April).
President Branko Crvenkovski is meeting on Friday with the mayors of municipalities, as part of his initiative for joint efforts "towards raising general awareness about the necessity of holding fair and regular parliamentary elections".
The government has come under increasing pressure from the international community to avoid irregularities that marred past elections.
Also Thursday, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha met with Arben Xhaferi, leader of the Macedonian opposition Democratic Party of Albanians, in Tirana.
Berisha told reporters that "all political forces in Macedonia, all Macedonian citizens and citizens of Albanian origin in the republic should be engaged and committed to a free and fair election process".

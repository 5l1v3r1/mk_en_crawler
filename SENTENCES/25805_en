ATHENS, Greece -- Customs officials decided on Thursday (February 18th) to extend their strike until February 24th. 
They walked off their jobs Tuesday to protest planned salary freezes and reduced bonuses. 
Protestors argue that austerity measures the government has announced to overcome the country's deep financial problems would cut between 300 and 700 euros of their monthly wages. 
The strike has affected cross-border trade, particularly fuel supplies. 
A general strike by public and private sector employees is planned for next Wednesday to protest the cut backs.
Separately, Greece is due to offer the European Commission more details about a currency swap deal with US investment bank Goldman Sachs dating to 2001. 
Athens is to send a letter to Brussels explaining how the deal affected the country's debt and deficit figures.
In an interview Thursday with Reuters, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou did not rule out the possibility of asking the IMF for help while urging the EU to be more specific about its support for Greece.

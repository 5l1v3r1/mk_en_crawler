ZAGREB, Croatia -- New counterintelligence chief Josko Podbevsek told a local newspaper on Tuesday (16 March) that he is ready to hand retired General Ante Gotovina to the UN war crimes tribunal without hesitation. 
His predecessor, Franjo Turek, resigned last Friday after chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte again accused the government of delaying the fugitive general's arrest.
Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited the Jasenovac Memorial Area, 100km south of Zagreb. 
There he condemned war crimes and said crimes against Jews committed at concentration camps in Croatia during World War 2 should not be forgotten.

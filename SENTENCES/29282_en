PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR Commander General Markus Bentler met with Serbia's Army Chief of the general staff, Lieutenant General Miloje Miletic in Pristina on Thursday (June 3rd).
They discussed increased co-operation and security on both sides of the border.
Serbian media reported that Miletic also raised the issue of Pristina authorities cutting the signal in Serbian telecommunication antennas last month.
The meeting is the result of the Joint Commission for Implementation, a duty deriving from the Kumanovo Agreement, signed between KFOR and the Serb Army in 1999.
Such meetings with army representatives from the region occur regularly, KFOR said in a statement.

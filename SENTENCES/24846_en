ZAGREB, Croatia â Croatia is ready to offer Slovenia access to the open sea in accordance with international law, Croatian President Stipe Mesic told Austrian O1 Radio on Thursday (April 2nd) in an attempt to offer a solution to the two countries' border dispute.
However, Mesic strongly criticised Slovenia for blocking Croatia's EU accession over the border dispute, stating that Slovenia halted the European millennium project while impeding the EU's enlargement to include Southeast Europe.
Meanwhile on Wednesday, the EU Troika, consisting of the past, current and future EU presidency holders, expressed serious concern over the standstill in the Croatian-Slovenian talks and urged the neighbours to find a solution.
The Troika statement came after the cancellation of a meeting between EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and the two countries' foreign ministers, caused by a Croatian refusal to respond to Rehn's latest proposed solution.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal accepted on Friday (August 20th) all 18 recently discovered diaries of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic as evidence in the ongoing trial against Radovan Karadzic.
Judges said the former Bosnian Serb leader did not challenge the authenticity of the notebooks.
The diaries, along with audio and video recordings, were found in the Belgrade apartment of Mladic's wife in February.
The trial against Karadzic is expected to resume on September 6th after a two-week break to allow him time to review the recordings.

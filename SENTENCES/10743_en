ATHENS, Greece -- Cabinet spokesman Thodoris Rousopoulos said on Monday (8 November) that Greece wants to intensify UN-sponsored talks with Skopje on finding a mutually acceptable solution to the name dispute. 
He added that Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and government members plan a series of meetings with Greek politicians this week, aimed at elaborating a national consensus on the issue. 
Though Washington now recognises Macedonia's constitutional name, Rousopoulos says the EU intends to continue using the name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".

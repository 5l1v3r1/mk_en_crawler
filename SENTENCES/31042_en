ANKARA, Turkey -- About 50 municipal officials in the Aegean provinces of Izmir and Aydin were detained on Monday (May 2nd) in an anti-corruption sweep targeting suspected interference in public tenders and fraudulent practices involving cultural and artistic events. 
Tender documents were seized during simultaneous raids at the municipal offices, held by the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). 
The CHP criticised the operations as politically motivated, noting the timing, six weeks shy of the June 12th general elections.

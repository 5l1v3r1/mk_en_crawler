THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj said on Thursday (January 8th) that he will not offer evidence in his defence at his trial under way at The Hague war crimes tribunal, once the prosecution hears from all its witnesses. 
The trial resumed on Thursday after a three-week interruption for the holidays. 
Prosecutors have another month to summon witnesses. 
After that, Seselj, who is conducting his own defence, plans to present his closing argument. 
He allegedly committed war crimes against Croats and Muslims in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Vojvodina between 1991 and 1995. 
His trial began in November 2007.

Albania is continuing to collect contributions for the South Asian areas affected by the Tsunami disaster and has established a special group -- called "Albania's Team", to co-ordinate relief efforts. 
Nearly 40 people, including doctors and medical staff, have registered as volunteers, though they won't be sent to the region just yet. 
For now, says Albanian Health Minister Leonard Solis, the WHO is requesting that countries send money rather than volunteers.
"The WHO directives for the ministries of health from other countries suggest those preparing contingents of doctors. 
But at the moment no one will be sent to the disaster areas until they ask for it. 
It is not recommended to send people, but only financial contributions through the international organisations which are dealing with the consequences of this natural catastrophe," Solis said.
The solidarity campaign in Albania has gathered momentum as more and more institutions become involved. 
Across the country, people have responded to the plight of those affected by the disaster.
"It is just unbelievable to see all the flooding and people left homeless with nothing. 
We, and the whole world, have to contribute to tackle the situation," said one student as he made a donation.
Campaign organisers of the civic movement Mjaft (Enough) have met with Albanian President Alfred Moisiu, who pledged his support for the initiative, as well as his monthly salary. 
At the beginning of January, two representatives flew to Banda Aceh, where the Albanian volunteer effort will be based.
The government has pledged $500,000 thus far, reported by the local media. 
According to the Albanian Red Cross, a considerable amount of funds has also been donated through other programmes. 
Among these is an initiative by AMC, a local mobile telephone company, which has been acccepting donations via text messaging.

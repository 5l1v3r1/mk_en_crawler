WASHINGTON, United States -- At an official luncheon given by Secretary of State Colin Powell on Monday (29 March), Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia will submit their NATO accession ratification documents -- a move that makes the seven countries de facto full-fledged members of the Alliance. 
After the ceremony, President George W. 
Bush will hold separate meetings with the prime ministers of each country. 
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer noted Bulgaria and Romania are ready to accede to the Pact, though they still must implement defence reforms and modernise their military equipment to meet NATO standards.

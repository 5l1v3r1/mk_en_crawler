THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal pressed charges Thursday (November 11th) against former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj for the murder, torture and cruel treatment of Serbs, Roma and Albanians.
His two fellow former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) members -- Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj -- are also charged on six counts in relation to war crimes committed at a KLA camp in the Decani area between March 1st and September 30th 1998.
The tribunal ordered a partial retrial of the three this past July.
Originally prosecuted in 2008 on charges of crimes against Serbs or their collaborators in 1998, Haradinaj and Balaj were acquitted, while Brahimaj was convicted of torture and sentenced to six years.
The three are now in custody at The Hague's Detention Unit, awaiting retrial next year.

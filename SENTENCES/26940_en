NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Prosecutors officially charged a TV host, her brother and another man Friday (February 5th) with the contract killing of the country's most influential media magnate, Andis Hadzikostis.
Elena Skordelli, her brother Anastasios Krasopoullis and Andreas Grigoriou are suspected of pre-meditated murder and conspiracy.
Hadzikostis, the CEO of the DIAS media and publishing group, was shot dead on January 11th outside his home in Nicosia.
Prosecutors say they suspect the crime was committed in part to avenge the host's dismissal.
Control over the DIAS television channel may have also played a role.
Police say a fourth suspect has likely fled abroad.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Election Committee said Sunday evening (20 April) that two candidates have registered so far for the 11 May presidential elections in Montenegro.
The candidates are Liberal Alliance leader Miodrag Zivkovic and Filip Vujanovic, deputy leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists.
The registration deadline is Monday.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Montenegrin courts will be ready to take on war crimes cases in six months.
Still unclear, however, is whether the international community will entrust local courts with the proceedings.

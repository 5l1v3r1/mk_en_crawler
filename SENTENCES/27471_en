BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Sunday (August 29th) that his country will help investigate the activities of Austrian Hypo Alpe Adria Bank which is suspected of laundering money for an alleged drug boss in Serbia. 
Dacic said that during his recent visit to Austria, he discussed the case with the country's police chief, Franz Lang. 
According to media reports, drug trafficker Darko Saric laundered about 100m euros between 2007 and 2009 through the Austrian bank, which was nationalised in December. 
Its former chief executive, Wolfgang Kulterer, was arrested earlier this month.
In other news, following a joint police operation by Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Dacic announced that six people were arrested and 15kg of explosives and six hand grenades were seized at the weekend. 
Five of the suspects were detained in Serbia and the other was arrested in BiH on charges of explosives and arms smuggling.

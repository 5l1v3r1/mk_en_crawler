BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament's lower chamber adopted a package of amendments Tuesday (March 3rd) to its own regulations that simplifies procedures for the criminal prosecution of former ministers. 
According to media reports, a simple majority, rather than the two-thirds required before, can approve prosecution. 
On Wednesday, members will vote on allowing criminal proceedings against former Prime Minster Adrian Nastase, who faces charges of abuse of office, blackmail and bribe-taking.
In other news Tuesday, media reported that Floricel Achim, the non-commissioned officer at the defence ministry under arrest for treason and espionage, has admitted to the charges against him. 
He said he sold classified information because he needed money. 
Achim allegedly sold military documents classified as state secrets -- including documents on military communication systems and radar frequencies, NATO maps and defence plans -- to Petar Marinov Zikolov, a Bulgarian citizen. 
Zikolov allegedly sent the documents to a foreign country, possibly Russia, according to media reports.

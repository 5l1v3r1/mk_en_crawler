SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Justice Ministry has sent Serbia a request for the extradition of Bozidar Vucurevic, ministry spokesperson Marina Bakic said on Thursday (April 14th). 
She pointed out that it is up to Serbian authorities to decide where Vucurevic will be sent. 
Croatia has already requested his extradition request, claiming he is responsible for war crimes against civilians committed during the 1991 shelling of Dubrovnik. 
Serbian police arrested Vucurevic, wartime mayor of the Bosnian town of Trebinje, on April 4th at a Bosnian-Serbian border crossing, based on war crimes charges. 
Bosnian prosecutors insist he has to be prosecuted in BiH as he is Bosnian citizen and is subject to an investigation for war crimes committed in Trebinje.

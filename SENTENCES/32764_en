SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Lyubomir Todorov says Bulgaria has a real chance of receiving a road map for joining the EU in January 2007 at the summit that begins Thursday (12 December) in Copenhagen. 
Participants are expected to confirm 1 January 2007 as the likely entry date, but it will most probably remain non-binding. 
The ministry views EU support for that tentative date as great progress in EU accession talks and suggests that it might pursue an earlier date after closing all negotiation chapters.

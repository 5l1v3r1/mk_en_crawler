PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci marked the tenth anniversary of NATO's action campaign against the former Yugoslavia as a historic event for Kosovo. 
"NATO's intervention against the Serb police, military and paramilitary forces ... 
opened a new chapter in Kosovo's history, the chapter of freedom and democracy," Thaci said on Monday (March 23rd).
In Serbia, however, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said the NATO campaign violated UN regulations, the Paris Charter and the main principles of international law. 
Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence last year represents a continuation of the "pressure and aggression that NATO carried out in 1999 against the Republic of Yugoslavia", Dacic said at a two-day conference marking the tenth anniversary of the air campaign.

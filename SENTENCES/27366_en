ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court will decide on Thursday (June 3rd) whether to accept the Republic People's Party (CHP) appeal of the new constitutional reform package.
Court Chairman Hasim Kilic says a rapporteur is working on the opposition CHP's application to annul the series of amendments which the CHP says is aimed at consolidating the power of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), at the expense of the judiciary and the armed forces.
The AKP wants to hold a public referendum on the amendments in September.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Nearly two months after the general elections, the country's top three political parties have agreed to form a ruling coalition. 
According to media reports, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) will get eight ministerial portfolios, the National Movement Simeon II (NMS-II) five, and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) three. 
A formal agreement between the three parties is to be signed late Monday (15 August). 
The decision came after a plea from President Georgi Parvanov, urging politicians to end the stalemate for the sake of Bulgaria's planned entry to the EU in 2007. 
He reportedly will give the mandate to form a government to MRF, the third-place finisher in the 25 June elections, as both BSP and NMS-II failed to implement the first two mandates.

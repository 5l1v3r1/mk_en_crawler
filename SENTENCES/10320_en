SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's complex constitutional structure might slow entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, said Bosko Siljegovic, chairman of the BiH parliamentary commission for defence and security. 
Speaking Tuesday (21 September), he said a NATO Parliamentary Assembly delegation to BiH cited problems with the constitutional structure as one of its main concerns, along with BiH's lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Meanwhile, Sarajevo is hosting a two-day financial conference of major donors and foreign governments. 
In all, 39 delegations are participating, focusing on reforms and development in BiH.

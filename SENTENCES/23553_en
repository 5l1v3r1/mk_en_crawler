TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Albania should consider democratic elections as a main condition for applying for EU candidate status this year, media reported on Wednesday (March 25th).
The Albanian government has previously said it intends to submit the country's application by the end of the current Czech EU presidency in June.
"Our recommendation is that Albania should first prove it is implementing properly the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and guarantee it is carrying out convincing pro-EU reforms," said Rehn.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Wrapping up a two-day visit to Ankara, Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari pledged Saturday (21 May) that his government would do its best to prevent Kurdish militants based in Iraq from crossing the Iraqi-Turkish border and conducting attacks. 
He made this statement after talks with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other senior officials. 
It was al-Jaafari's first foreign trip since the new Iraqi government was formed. 
Agreements reached include the opening of a new border checkpoint in the coming months, as well as the training of new Iraqi Army members by Turkey.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Montenegrin and EU officials signed a memorandum of understanding Monday (March 3rd) regarding Podgorica's participation in the EU's competitiveness and innovations programme (CIP).
Montenegro is the fourth of candidate and potential candidate countries to join, after Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey.
Participation in the programme will allow Montenegro to apply for projects aimed at promoting competitiveness and innovation, on an equal footing with EU member states.
Separately Monday, Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic said most EU members are likely to ratify the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU as early as this year.
Two countries have ratified it so far -- Slovenia and Estonia.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic says his Democratic Party (DS) will nominate former Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic for prime minister if the DS wins the January 21st parliamentary elections. 
Addressing an election rally Tuesday (January 9th), Tadic said the party's goal is to realise the political and economic vision of the late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who was assassinated in 2003.
Later on Tuesday, the leader of G17 Plus, Mladjan Dinkic, who resigned at the end of 2006 as finance minister, told B92 that he would not like to enter a government that includes Djelic. 
They served together in Djindjic's cabinet.

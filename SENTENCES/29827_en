BELGRADE, Serbia -- Opposition leader Tomislav Nikolic, who has been on a hunger strike for five days demanding snap elections in December, agreed to drink water Thursday (April 21st).
Nikolic, 59, is severely dehydrated and only agreed after an appeal from the head of Serbia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Irinej.
The hospital where he was admitted says Nikolic still refuses to eat anything.

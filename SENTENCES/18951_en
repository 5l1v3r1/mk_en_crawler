ZAGREB, Croatia -- Two former generals are due to go on trial for war crimes allegedly committed during the 1991-1995 conflict, officials announced on Thursday (May 3rd).
Mirko Norac and Rahim Ademi are accused of allowing troops under their command to murder 30 Serb civilians and prisoners of war during a commando raid on rebel Serb territory in September 1993.
The trial, set to begin in Zagreb next month, is seen as a major test of Croatia's judiciary.
Norac and Ademi were initially indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, but the case was transferred to Croatia in September 2005.

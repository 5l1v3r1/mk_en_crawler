PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The US administration favours the transfer of some powers from UNMIK to Kosovo institutions by the end of the year as scheduled, according to Reno Harnish, Chief of Mission of the US Office in Pristina.
On Friday (25 April), Harnish quoted from remarks the US Representative to the UN for Special Political Affairs, Richard Williamson, made to the Security Council.
Williamson acknowledged that several problems need to be resolved in Kosovo and that the situation in the province is still of great importance to Washington.
Kosovo Serbs had complained to the Security Council that UNMIK head Michael Steiner is rushing the transfer of power before key problems are addressed.

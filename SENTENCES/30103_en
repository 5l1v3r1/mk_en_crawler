ATHENS, Greece -- Plans to cut the budget deficit may fail soon unless the government works harder to implement fiscal and structural reforms, IMF envoy Paul Thomsen warned on Wednesday (May 18th).
"The programme will not remain on track without a determined reinvigoration of structural reforms in the coming months," said Thomsen, who arrived last week to assess progress in meeting fiscal targets.
Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou promised to continue efforts to overcome the grave financial crisis but acknowledged "There are no magic restructuring scenarios that could help Greece resolve its problems." (To Vima, Ta Nea, Ethnos, Reporter.gr, Imerisia - 18/05/11)

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's pro-Western government fought for survival Thursday (16 October) as parliament convened for a possible no-confidence vote against the cabinet.
For the second time this week, deputies in the 250-seat assembly gathered for a proposed discussion about the government's performance.
In the debate, legislators could vote out of office the republic's first democratic government since World War II.
The ruling coalition, Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), managed to stave off the parliamentary vote Tuesday.
Since then, it has been trying to consolidate its support in the assembly.
But the small Social Democratic Party rejected an offer from DOS early Thursday morning, apparently deciding not to help remove the no-confidence vote from the agenda.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police failed to arrest Vetevendosje (Self- Determination) movement leader Albin Kurti on Monday (April 26th), despite spotting him at a funeral in Pristina.
After the ceremony, the Special Police Unit set up a cordon to arrest him but movement activists thwarted them, leaving 12 people injured.
Kurti faces charges stemming from a protest in February 2007 that turned violent, leaving two protestors dead and dozens injured.
His trial has been postponed eight times over his failure to appear at the sessions, to protest international missions that don't recognise Kosovo's independence.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Albania assumed the rotating presidency of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Organisation (BSEC) from Ukraine on Tuesday (May 13th).
Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha was in Istanbul for the ceremony, where he presented Albania's priorities and calendar of activities.
He said Albania will focus on continuing the structural reform of the organisation, increasing co-operation with international players such the EU and the UN, and boosting co-operation among BSEC member countries.
Established nearly six years ago and headquartered in Istanbul, the organisation's goal is to strengthen both political and economic co-operation among Black Sea countries and to ensure peace, stability and prosperity.
It has 11 members -- Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.
In other news Tuesday, Albanian opposition leader Edi Rama called for a nationwide discussion on amending the constitution concerning lawmakers' immunity from prosecution.
He leads the large Socialist Party.
Ilir Meta, leader of the smaller opposition Socialist Movement for Integration, argues the time for amendments concerning immunity was last month, when lawmakers adopted a series of constitutional changes.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government relieved former President Momir Bulatovic of his obligation to keep a state secret Thursday (November 4th) regarding the deportation of Bosniak civilians from Montenegro in 1992. 
Bulatovic was due to testify in September at the trial of nine people charged in the case but did not because the court rejected his request to be allowed to use state secrets to defend policies in effect during the 1990s. 
Nine former police officers are charged with crimes against civilians for handing over 79 Bosniaks to Bosnian Serbs. 
Most of the Muslims, who escaped to Montenegro during the 1992-1995 conflict, died at the hands of the Serbs.

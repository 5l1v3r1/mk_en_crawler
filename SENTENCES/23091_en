SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Observers from the OSCE said on Monday (June 2nd) that massive violations marred Sunday's snap elections.
In an official statement, the OSCE described vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud predominantly within ethnic Albanian areas.
Observers noted that violence at 30 polling stations prevented some from casting votes.
Election Day violence killed one person and injured ten others.
There were 28 arrests, police spokesman Ivo Kotevski announced.
The OSCE also concluded that throughout the campaign, the media generally favoured the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, which won an outright ruling majority on Sunday.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer expressed deep concern Monday, saying, "Countries working towards NATO membership must make every effort to meet the democratic standards of the Alliance." Macedonia's failure to win an invitation to membership in April led to the early elections.

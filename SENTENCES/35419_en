LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- Bulgaria wrapped up its accession talks with the EU on Monday (14 June) when it closed the last two chapters in the marathon negotiations. 
The EU foreign ministers are due to approve the decision at a meeting later on Tuesday. 
Bulgaria could thus join the Union on 1 January 2007. 
Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, told reporters that the ministers would give the European Commission the option of delaying Sofia's accession by one year if it finds that the already adopted reforms are not being implemented properly. 
He also pledged to work on closing Romania's chapters on energy and services by the end of June.

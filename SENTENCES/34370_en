ZONGULDAK, Turkey -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas refused on Wednesday (22 October) to meet US Special Co-ordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston. 
Though he noted a scheduling conflict, Denktas added there was no point in repeating the same offers and counter-offers again. 
Denktas instead began a visit to Turkey's province of Zonguldak, at the invitation of local authorities.

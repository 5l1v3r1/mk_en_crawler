MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic called on Belgrade Saturday (25 December) to get ready for talks with Pristina on the final status of Kosovo, saying that negotiations were certain to start in 2005 and that so far Belgrade has not prepared for them adequately.
He urged authorities to increase diplomatic activity and dialogue with the Kosovo people as well as the international community.

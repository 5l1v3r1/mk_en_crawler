PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek says the president should be elected directly by citizens, in order to avoid any kind of pressure in parliament, Radio Free Europe reported on Sunday (February 27th).
Lunacek was present when lawmakers elected Behgjet Pacolli last week in a third round of voting.
A number of parliamentary representatives changed their minds between the second and the third round, following alleged political pressure imposed during a break.
Opposition parties are preparing to challenge Pacolli's election, arguing that parliamentary procedures were breached.
Soon after, they add, Pacolli violated the constitution when he voted for the new government.

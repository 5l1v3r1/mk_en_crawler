BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS) and G17 Plus held a new round of talks Wednesday (March 14th), aimed at forming a new Serbian government. 
Afterwards the two parties said they agreed on the need to arrange trilateral negotiations involving the third potential partner from the so-called democratic bloc, the Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia coalition, later this week. 
The DS expects an agreement on the new coalition cabinet by the end of this month.

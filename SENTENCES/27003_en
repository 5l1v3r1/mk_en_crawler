BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso has voiced hope that the influx of asylum seekers from Serbia and Macedonia to Belgium will not affect efforts to offer visa-free travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), media in Sarajevo reported on Sunday (March 7th).
BiH officials insist that the country will be included in the visa-free regime by the July vacation season.

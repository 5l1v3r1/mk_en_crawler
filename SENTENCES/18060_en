TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama is urging Prime Minister Sali Berisha of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) to start roundtable talks on electing a consensus candidate for president, SP spokesman Saimir Tahiri said on Monday (June 18th).
The spokesman said SP views the talks as crucial, so the upcoming parliamentary vote on outgoing President Alfred Moisiu's successor does not turn into "a parliamentary crisis".
Berisha said that Deputy Prime Minister Gazmend Oketa and DP lawmaker Astrit Patozi are prepared to launch negotiations immediately.

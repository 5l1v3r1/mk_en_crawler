SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia City Court decided Wednesday (5 May) to relieve Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski of his duties until the ongoing probe against him is completed. 
Prosecutors sought the action amid concerns Sofianski might exert pressure on some witnesses. 
The investigation against Sofianski, launched earlier this week, concerns the 1998 sale of the city's central market to the Israeli company Ashtrom. 
According to prosecutors, the price was nearly 400 times below market value.
In other news, a Libyan court on Thursday sentenced six Bulgarian medics and a Palestinian doctor to death by firing squad for deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with the HIV virus, court officials said. 
The health workers, detained in Tripoli in early 1999, were convicted of giving 426 Libyan children at a Benghazi hospital HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- through contaminated blood products. 
Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and Parliament Speaker Ognyan Gerdjikov vowed to do everything possible to appeal the verdicts.

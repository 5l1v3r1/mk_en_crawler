BELGRADE, Serbia -- The IMF gave the green light Friday (January 16th) to a $530m credit for Serbia. 
The funds will be provided for a period of 15 months in support of the government's programme to provide macro economic and financial stability, the IMF said in a statement. 
However, the Fund notes that the loan should be viewed as a preventive measure and should be spent only if necessary.

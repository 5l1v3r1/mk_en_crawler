BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea on Wednesday (September 3rd) announced his resignation from parliament's lower house, allowing an investigation into corruption allegations against him to proceed. 
The Social Democratic Party lawmaker said he decided to step down after the lower house rejected a prosecution request to launch a criminal inquiry against him and former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase. 
Mitrea said resigning is the only way for him to emerge "with honour" instead of "hiding behind his immunity". 
Prosecutors have charged him with bribery and illegally receiving building materials for two properties, when he was transport minister between 2001 and 2004.

TIRANA, Albania -- The small opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) announced on Saturday (July 4th) it has accepted an invitation to form a coalition government with Prime Minister Sali Berisha's Democratic Party (DP).
SMI leader Ilir Meta described the decision as the most difficult of his political career.
"I have no other choice.
My refusal would lead the country into crisis," he said.
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is still counting votes a week after the election.
On Saturday, CEC spokesman Leonard Olli said the DP won 71 of 140 parliamentary seats, though 50 of the total of 4,735 ballot boxes remain untallied.

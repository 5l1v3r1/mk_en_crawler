ROME, Italy -- Interpol announced on Friday (May 14th) that police have arrested a suspected member of the "Pink Panthers" jewel thief gang.
Radovan Jelusic, 39, of Montenegro, was detained in Rome, allegedly while travelling with a forged Croatian passport.
He is wanted in Cyprus, Japan and several other countries.
His capture comes about two weeks after another suspected member of the gang, Bojan Vuckovic, was arrested in Montenegro.
The Pink Panthers, believed to be comprised mostly of Balkan nationals, are thought to have stolen more than 250m euros' worth of jewels from various stores worldwide.

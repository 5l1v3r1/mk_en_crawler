ANKARA, Turkey -- Istanbul's centre on Wednesday (October 7th) continued to be the scene of clashes between police and protestors on the last day of the IMF and World Bank sessions there. 
After clashes along Istiklal Boulevard on Tuesday, which resulted in over 100 arrests, the Sisli region was also engulfed in chaos on Wednesday. 
A group of about 200 protestors broke windows of banks and stores. 
Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd, who threw stones at a police car and attacked a police officer riding a motor cycle. 
In a statement, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guller said 25 people were arrested in Wednesday's protests. 
He denied that police used excessive power against the protestors. 
According to him, police officers acted in self defence after being pelted with stones and Molotov cocktails.

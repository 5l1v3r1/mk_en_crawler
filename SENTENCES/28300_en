BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Sunday (October 17th) that Serbia has the capacity to cope with violence, and assured the public that the country is stable and safe.
In an interview with the daily Politika, he commented on two recent violent incidents:
first, clashes that erupted during a Gay Pride Parade in Belgrade, and then in Genoa, during the European Championship qualifier between Italy and Serbia.
Tadic says organised crime is linked to both violent soccer fan groups and extreme political organisations.
Separately Sunday, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that police are investigating media allegations that Serbian hooligans may have been paid to provoke violence during the match in Genoa.
Politika reported at the weekend that more than 200,000 euros were paid to more than 60 hooligans for organising the trip, getting equipment and rioting in Italy.

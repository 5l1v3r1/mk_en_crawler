BUCHAREST, Romania -- Gheorghe Flutur, executive president of the Liberal Democratic Party, said on Tuesday (May 29th) that his party would co-sign a proposed no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's cabinet. 
The Democratic Party (PD) plans to file the motion next week. 
PD leader Emil Boc says Tariceanu has proved unable to meet the challenges of EU membership and should take responsibility for the recent failed referendum to impeach President Traian Basescu.

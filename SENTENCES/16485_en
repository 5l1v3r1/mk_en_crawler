ATHENS, Greece -- Investigators are blaming pilot error for the 2005 crash of a Cypriot airliner that claimed the lives of 121 people.
According to the investigators' final report, released on Tuesday (October 10th), the German captain and the Greek Cypriot pilot of the Helios Air flight did not properly identify a warning of a drop in cabin pressure.
The two pilots also failed to switch pressurisation to automatic from manual before takeoff.
They and most of the passengers became incapacitated when pressure in the cabin dropped.

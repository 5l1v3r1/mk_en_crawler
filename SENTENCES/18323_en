TIRANA, Albania -- Western envoys in Tirana are again urging Albania's political parties to immediately start implementing crucial electoral reform. 
A joint statement issued on Tuesday (March 13th) by the EU Presidency, the United States, Italy and the OSCE read that the need for reforms was demonstrated once again Sunday, during elections in the western town of Shijak. 
The envoys said the vote was marred by a "troubled and tense atmosphere". 
Voters went to the polls to elect a new member of Parliament, replacing Sokol Olldashi, who resigned to run in last month's Tirana mayoral race.

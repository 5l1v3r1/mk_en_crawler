BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu called on Monday (October 25th) for changes to the voting procedure in parliament, saying the system is defective. 
He takes issue specifically with the procedure through which each law is analysed and debated within specialised parliamentary committees and then voted by all lawmakers in accordance with the group leaders' indications. 
He says instead, proposed legislation must be analysed by all members of parliament so each is fully aware of the content. 
He also urged the presidents of the two chambers to stop sending him bills for promulgation that fail to meet procedural conditions.
Over the past several weeks, there have been a couple of scandals involving voting procedures. 
One of them was a vote forgery accusation on the pension law brought by the opposition against Roberta Anastase, president of the Deputies Chamber, who double counted the number of lawmakers present in the room in order to get quorum. 
The other one involved lawmakers who adopted by mistake a steep cut in the VAT on basic food products and a tax exemption for small pensions. 
They say they were misled by the group's leader.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main opposition SDSM said on Monday (February 28th) it will propose a replacement for State Election Commission President Aleksandar Novakovski, who resigned last week, but they will not return to parliament unless their demands are met. 
Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanoski says the session to elect the new head of the commission will be held on March 15th. 
The opposition, led by the SDSM, walked out of parliament in late January to protest the freezing of A1 TV's bank accounts.

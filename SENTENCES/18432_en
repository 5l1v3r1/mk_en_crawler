TIRANA, Albania -- The country's main political parties finalised a deal on electoral reforms Saturday (January 13th), clearing the way for local elections next month.
The deal ends a stalemate between the 12 parties that make up the governing coalition of Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the Socialist-led opposition of Tirana Mayor Edi Rama.
The two sides had battled over reforms for more than a year.
The deal, signed after midnight Friday, resolved the key issue of using birth certificates as proof of identity by voters on Election Day.
Since there are no government-issued ID cards in the country, all voters using birth certificates will have to bring two additional forms of identification with them to the polls.
Following the political agreement, Parliament passed the relevant legal changes in the electoral code and the Constitution at an extraordinary session Saturday.
President Alfred Moisiu, who marshalled the talks, will choose the new election date.
The OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, welcomed the agreement and praised the parties for choosing "the path of constructive dialogue".

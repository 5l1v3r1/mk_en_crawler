SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement Tuesday (May 6th), ambassadors of the Peace Implementation Council's (PIC) steering board urged the BiH parliament to approve proposed changes to the election law that would give all former residents of Srebrenica -- scene of a 1995 genocide against Muslims -- the opportunity to vote in this autumn's local elections. 
"Srebrenica can turn from a symbol of tragedy into a symbol of political wisdom, responsibility and economic progress," the ambassadors said. 
Clifford Bond, the OHR special envoy for Srebrenica, also supported the proposal. 
Both houses of the BiH parliament vote on the proposed changes Wednesday.
In other news on Tuesday, Brcko District Supervisor Raffi Gregorian amended the Statute of Brcko District and enacted a new District Election Law and Rules of Procedure for the district assembly. 
Gregorian said the moves are aimed at boosting the efficiency and functionality of the Brcko administration and prepare it for period after supervision by the international community.

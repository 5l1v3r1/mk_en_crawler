ROME, Italy -- An Italian extremist group calling itself the Armed Group for Ethnic Cleansing has claimed responsibility for an attack on Romanian citizens of Roma origin in Livorno on August 11th, which left four children dead in a fire.
In a letter to Il Tirreno newspaper, quoted by Romanian media on Monday (August 20th), the group -- previously unknown to authorities -- said its goal is to cleanse Italy of all Roma people.
It warned of more serious attacks if they don't leave the country within weeks.
Hotnews.ro reports that this is not the first incident against Roma people in Italy.
Last December, several illegal camps housing Romanian Romas were torched.

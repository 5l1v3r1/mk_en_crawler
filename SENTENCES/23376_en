BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Monday (May 25th) he does not expect any government reshuffle after the European Parliament elections in June and the release of the European Commission's (EC) progress report on judicial reforms.
"I am convinced that ministers will further step up their efforts in the upcoming period to support investment and anti-corruption measures," Boc told journalists.
He stressed that all bureaucratic obstacles to implementing the governing programme have been removed.
"We are now working at the right speed," Boc said.
In other news Monday, Transport Minister Radu Berceanu announced the layoff of 3,700 employees from the National Railway Company.
"This is just the first step we are taking to solve the tough situation of Romanian railways," Berceanu told reporters after meeting with union leaders.
Unions have agreed to give up some bonuses, saving an estimated 4,000 jobs, the minister said.
The transport ministry's original proposal envisioned up to 12,000 layoffs.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Taxi drivers in Belgrade and 19 other cities and towns kicked off a strike Thursday (December 17th) against a government order to introduce cash registers as of January 2010. 
They insist on a two-year postponement and also want a clear definition of a minimum level of taxi service fees. 
Negotiations Wednesday with Trade Minister Slobodan Milosavljevic failed, prompting drivers to stage their protest. 
The strike is expected to snarl traffic in the capital.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Crisis Group's Europe Programme Director Sabine Freizer told Radio Free Europe on Monday (April 5th) it would be good for Serbia to foster positive relations with Kosovo.
A solution must be found to enable both countries to take part in regional initiatives, she added.
Freizer praised Serbia for condemning the Srebrenica massacre, but added that regional co-operation is impossible without Serbia's participation.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The members of Bulgaria's ruling coalition -- NMS-II, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) and New Time -- have failed to strike a deal on a new pre-election alliance. 
Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov, a senior official in NMS-II, said Tuesday (29 March) that his party would likely to run alone in parliamentary elections expected this summer, though coalitions might be formed for seats representing certain areas.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The case at The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's independence is "the trial of the century", Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Friday (April 17th), as the two sides in the trial presented their arguments.
"This is the first time in history when an act of secession is being considered from the aspect of international law.
What will be judged here is the right of self-determination and the right of strengthening the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the internationally recognised and sovereign state," Jeremic told Serbian state television, RTS.
Pristina, on the other hand, said on Friday that by contesting Kosovo's independence, Serbia aims to cause tension in its former province.
Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni said he is convinced that the ICJ will support Kosovo's independence.
"The declaration of independence and the fight for freedom are not a legal issue.
This is a result of an historic process," Hyseni said.

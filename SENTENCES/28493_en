SOFIA, Bulgaria -- General Prosecutor Boris Velchev rejected on Thursday (April 15th) media reports of a money laundering investigation against Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the third biggest party in parliament.
"There is no such thing at the moment," Velchev said.
According to reports published on Wednesday, the investigation targets a 750,000-euro commission that Dogan received for advisory services involving four hydropower projects.

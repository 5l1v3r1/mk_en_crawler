PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Dusko Saric, brother of alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric, has been remanded to 30 days in custody. 
Biljana Covic, spokeswoman for the High Court in Biijelo Polje, said on Wednesday (November 17th) that the measure was imposed to prevent Saric from influencing witnesses or escaping. 
Montenegrin police detained him and two Serbian citizens a couple of days ago, based on an arrest warrant issued by Italy for drug dealing. 
His brother, Darko Saric, is suspected of smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America.

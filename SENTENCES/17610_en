TIRANA, Albania -- During a cabinet session Wednesday (March 28th), Prime Minister Sali Berisha said the fight against the grey economy is a top government priority. 
He said the authorities would pursue a zero tolerance policy against economic crime. 
Combating it is an essential pre-condition for developing a free market and attracting more foreign investment, Berisha said. 
Also Wednesday, the Institute for Research and Alternative Development released the results of a survey on corruption. 
It found that corruption levels remained high last year. 
The public perceived state institutions, doctors, custom officials and judges as most corrupt, while the president and religious leaders were seen as least corrupt.
In other news, the Albanian NGO Free Think Forum put forward a proposal aimed at preventing blood feuds. 
The draft, prepared with the help of top lawyers, calls for the establishment of a special permanent government panel and a public information campaign.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney cautioned on Monday (8 May) that BiH could not move forward without changes in the Dayton constitution that was written ten years ago. 
He repeated that parliament's failure to adopt the amendments was a disappointment to Washington and to the entire international community.
Separately, the former High Representative in BiH, Wolfgang Petritsch, warned in a press interview that some EU member states may stop supporting BiH, because of its failure to adopt the constitutional changes. 
In an interview in Tuesday's edition of Nezavisne novine, Petritsch criticised politicians who he said were obstructing BiH's development.

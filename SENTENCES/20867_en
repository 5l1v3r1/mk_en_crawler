PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK said on Wednesday (September 5th) that the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, can participate in the November 17th local and parliamentary elections in Kosovo. 
He is currently on trial at the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. 
Tribunal spokeswoman Olga Kavran told reporters that prosecutors are concerned by Haradinaj's intention to run in the election, as it may lead to witness intimidation.

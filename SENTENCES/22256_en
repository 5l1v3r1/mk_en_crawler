SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission (EC) expects convictions in key corruption cases within months, said Jonathan Faull, director general of the justice, freedom and security department. 
He visited Sofia on Monday (November 17th), ahead of a trip by his superior, EU Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot, who will assess progress before the EC publishes its interim report on Bulgarian judicial reforms in February. 
Convictions are expected in cases involving corruption or fraud associated with EU funding, as well as in cases of key organised crime figures.

TIRANA, Albania -- Helmut Lohan, head of the European Commission (EC) delegation in Tirana, urged Albania to continue reforming its judicial system, media reported on Thursday (October 9th). 
"Reforms are needed to allow the system to be independent from political influence, despite changes in government," Lohan stressed. 
He also urged political leaders to speed up and complete work on the Election Code and other preparations for next year's elections.

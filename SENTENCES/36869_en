SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Politicians from all parliamentary parties have expressed support for Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov's call for courts to sentence criminals more quickly and efficiently. 
Borissov met with politicians Thursday (8 July), in a session that was also attended by Europol representatives. 
Borissov says he persuaded the politicians that a criminal possessing illegal arms should be sentenced to 15-20 years in prison. 
His other proposal -- that money counterfeiters receive speedier and more effective sentences -- also received backing.

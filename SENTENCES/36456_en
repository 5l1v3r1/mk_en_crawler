BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Defence reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are progressing well, but the country needs to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal, said NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer during talks Wednesday (12 May) in Brussels with BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic.
BiH hopes to learn before next month's NATO summit in Istanbul whether its bid for membership in the Partnership for Peace programme has been accepted.
Radovanovic indicated that it might be linked to the arrest of top war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
In Brussels, Radovanovic also met EU security chief Javier Solana to discuss the possible EU take-over of NATO's mission in BiH.

DOBOJ, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Borislav Paravac said on Friday (24 June) that the first meeting of BiH leaders aimed at resolving the crisis in the Council of Ministers ended in Doboj without concrete results.
Paravac confirmed that the dispute between BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic remains serious.
At issue is Terzic's decision to accept a resignation letter by Ivanic, months after it was initially offered.
Ivanic says Terzic acted illegally, and the functioning of the central government has been blocked now for weeks.
Paravac says leaders will meet again on Monday to try to reach a settlement.

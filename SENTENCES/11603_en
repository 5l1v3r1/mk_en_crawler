ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is reportedly preparing a new anti-terror law in light of increased attacks, both in the country and in Europe.
NTV reported on Wednesday (20 July) that the new legislation would be aimed at tightening penalties for terror groups, including extremists from the outlawed Kurdistan People's Party (PKK), and at fighting international terrorism more efficiently.
Returning from a visit abroad Wednesday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the government's patience is wearing thin.
He warned the PKK that Turkey would do whatever is necessary to combat terrorism.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council is urging several nations in Southeast Europe to speed up efforts to arrest the most-wanted war crimes suspects. 
On Wednesday (4 August), the 15-member body unanimously called on Serbia-Montenegro, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to "intensify co-operation" with the UN court so that fugitives Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, Ante Gotovina and others could be brought to justice. 
The Council also reiterated its timetables for the tribunals on Yugoslavia and Rwanda. 
The UN wants all investigations to be completed by the end of this year and the trials to end by 2008, leaving another two years for the appeals.

TIRANA, Albania -- Helmut Lohan, the new head of the European Commission delegation in Tirana, insisted on Wednesday (20 September) that all Albanian parties and politicians should co-operate in efforts to implement commitments stemming from the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) signed with the EU.
Lohan met with Integration Minister Arenca Trashani, who agreed that the SAA would boost the economy by securing competition and the quality of local production.
They also discussed strengthening the capacity of public administration and the EC delegation's role in providing financial and technical aid needed to implement EU-related reforms.

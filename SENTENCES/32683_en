THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Dutch government decided on Friday (20 December) not to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Croatia that would have started the accession process. 
Dutch Foreign Minister Jaap de Hoop Scheffer sent a letter to parliament explaining that the decision was made following Croatia's refusal to extradite retired Gen Janko Bobetko to The Hague tribunal. 
Bobetko is wanted for atrocities committed against Serbs during a 1993 military operation. 
Britain has decided to delay the ratification for similar reasons. 
The move by the two governments blocks the start of talks between Croatia and the EU because all 15 member-countries must ratify the agreement before it can take effect. 
Prime Minister Ivica Racan says the Dutch government's move was a short-term action that would have no significant impact on Croatia's bid to join the Union.

The goal was to get the slots filled ahead of the 23 November parliamentary elections.
Also Thursday, the government decided to follow the advice of the Constitutional Court and a prominent NGO, and delay by-elections in five municipal councils until 14 December, rather than holding the elections on 23 November as well.

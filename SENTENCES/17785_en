BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari has sent letters to the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo, advising them that he will unveil his plan for the future of the province on February 2nd. 
The UN mediator will present his blueprint in separate meetings with top officials in Belgrade and Pristina. 
Before he travels to the Balkans, Ahtisaari will brief the six members of the Contact Group for Kosovo behind closed doors in Vienna on Friday (January 26th).
In other news, a senior British diplomat said on Tuesday that he does not expect any "fundamental renegotiation" of Ahtisaari's plan for Kosovo. 
John Sawers, the political director of the British Foreign Office, said the governments of Serbia and Kosovo would get an opportunity to suggest minor changes. 
The document then would be submitted to the UN Secretary General and the Security Council for a vote.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Supreme Defence Council decided Wednesday (2 July) to allow the UN war crimes tribunal to use classified minutes of meetings Slobodan Milosevic held with other officials from 1991 to 2000. 
The international court requested the documents in June. 
The move was seen as highlighting the new reformist government's willingness to co-operate more closely with UN prosecutors.
In other news, the Serbian government and the OSCE have agreed to work together to bolster voter registration. 
Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic will initiate the necessary legislative changes.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkish and Israeli security officials combed through wreckage Sunday (16 November) after two car bombs near Istanbul synagogues killed at least 22 people and wounded more than 240. 
Israeli Mossad secret service teams were on hand, sources said. 
NTV television reported that police have detained three people in connection with the blasts, two of them women wearing Muslim-style headscarves, but police would not confirm this. 
Officials said international groups -- possibly including Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda militant network -- might be behind the Saturday morning blasts -- minutes apart -- which killed Jews attending Sabbath prayers and Muslim passers-by. 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the bombings and said they underscored the need for international co-operation in fighting terrorism.

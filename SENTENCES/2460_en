A high-protocol meeting between Pope Benedict XVI and Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic took place on 16 January. 
It represented a significant historical event for the Balkan republic, as Vujanovic was the first Montenegrin president to visit the Vatican.
According to a statement released by Vujanovic, the pontiff told him that the Vatican understands the need of Montenegro's citizens to restore their statehood, and that it backs the stance of the EU and the international community regarding the planned independence referendum. 
The Holy See is prepared to acknowledge the democratic outcome, Benedict reportedly said.
Vujanovic briefed him on the situation in the republic ahead of the vote, expressing hope that it would lead to an agreement between the administration and the opposition in democratic conditions.
Relations between Orthodox and Roman Catholic believers in Montenegro were also discussed. 
Vujanovic described them as "excellent" and invited the pope to visit the republic to witness firsthand its rich culture and religious tolerance.
During his 20-minute visit, Vujanovic also presented a copy of the concordat, which Montenegro's Prince Nikola signed with the Vatican in 1886, during the pontificate of Leo XIII. 
Montenegro was the first predominantly Orthodox country to sign such a pact with the Holy See, Vujanovic said, adding that the document had provided a model for agreements with other countries in the Orthodox world.
Vujanovic also conferred with the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, discussing Montenegrin and regional affairs. 
In addition, the president's agenda while in Rome included a meeting with the Grand Master of the Maltese Order, Fra' Andrew Bertie.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government is convinced that Serbia's draft resolution on Kosovo's secession will not be endorsed by the UN General Assembly in September, Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni told a cabinet meeting Wednesday (August 25th). 
He added that Kosovo is working around the clock to defeat Belgrade's document, and said institutions are co-ordinating their actions with the so-called Quint countries -- the US, Germany, France, UK and Italy. 
Serbia's resolution says "unilateral secession is not an acceptable way to solve territorial issues" and calls for a "mutually acceptable solution to all open issues", reached through dialogue. 
It was issued right after the International Court of Justice's July 22nd advisory opinion that Kosovo's independence declaration did not violate international law.

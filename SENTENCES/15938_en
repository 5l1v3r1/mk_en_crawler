SMOLYAN, Bulgaria -- Smolyan prosecutors have asked relevant security agencies to check the activities and assets of an Islamic religious association, the Union for Islamic Development and Culture (UIDC). 
Smolyan Regional Prosecutor Dimcho Georgiev said on Tuesday (19 September) that prosecutors decided to act after the private national bTV channel broadcast a weekend report about the UIDC and its wide range of activities in the Rhodopes region, all of which "require a lot of money", according to Georgiev.
Last month, the UIDC was fined after a state commission ruled that the organisation encouraged Muslim girls to ignore school regulations and wear traditional headscarves to school.

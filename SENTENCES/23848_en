PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament failed to reach consensus Thursday (January 22nd) while debating a resolution that would condemn crimes committed by the former Yugoslav communist regime in Kosovo.
Lawmakers did, however, agree that the resolution -- which they say needs clarifications -- would go to a vote during the next session.
Opposition parties downplayed the importance of the resolution.
"All of us here know that the crimes that happened against the people of Kosovo were ideologically based only in small part;
they were ethnically based.
They happened even before communism and after communism, too," Alliance for the Future of Kosovo member Ardian Gjini said.

TIRANA, Albania -- Leaders of the ruling Democratic Party-led coalition and the main opposition Socialist Party-led coalition met behind closed doors Thursday (July 5th) evening to discuss the ongoing deadlock over candidates for president.
They agreed to hold the third and final round of voting by parliament on Sunday.
If it fails, as did the first two rounds, parliament would be disbanded and the country would face early elections.
Incumbent President Alfred Moisiu's term expires on July 24th.

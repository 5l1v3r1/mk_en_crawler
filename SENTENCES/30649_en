BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet decided late Thursday (April 7th) to initiate the accountability procedure over a planned wage cap in public education. 
This means that the law will be approved by the government, without parliamentary debate, after Prime Minister Emil Boc addresses the parliament on the issue. 
In such cases, the opposition then has the opportunity to file a no-confidence motion against the government. 
The cabinet has survived several such motions in the past. 
Boc has explained the government cannot afford a 50% salary increase for professors who sued the government and won. 
That 50% increase was decided by parliament at the end of 2008, right before the elections, despite warnings by former Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu that the budget could not bear such hikes.

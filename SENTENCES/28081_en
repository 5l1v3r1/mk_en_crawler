NEW YORK, United States -- The group Human Rights Watch criticised Turkish police on Tuesday (April 20th) for using excessive force in recent weeks. 
The watchdog group cites several incidents, including violence against children and lethal action against those under arrest. 
Last year, a total of 48 fatal shootings were documented, the report said, advising the government to better train its security forces.

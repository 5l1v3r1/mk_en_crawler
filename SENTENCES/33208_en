BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said on Thursday (12 June) his country categorically supports the latest UN Security Council resolution extending, for one year, the immunity of UN peacekeepers from prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Passy said the extension provides an opportunity for the EU and the United States to reach an agreement on the issue.
Croatia, meanwhile, appears to have decided not to sign a reciprocal immunity agreement with the United States that would have exempted citizens from ICC jurisdiction.
Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Simonovic said, however, that negotiations with Washington would continue.

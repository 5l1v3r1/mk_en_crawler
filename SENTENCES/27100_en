SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov insisted on Friday (July 31st) that the country's three major energy projects should not be offered to private investors.
Parvanov emphasised the projects were aimed at improving the country's energy security, not at immediate financial gains.
The government has questioned the financial benefits of the South Stream natural gas pipeline project, the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, and the second nuclear plant in Belene, and suggested they should be handled by private investors.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities have arrested a non-commissioned officer with the defence ministry on charges of treason, the ministry's organised crime and terrorism unit said in a statement Monday (March 2nd). 
Officer Floricel Achim allegedly sold classified military documents to a Bulgarian citizen identified as Marinov Zikolov, whom police arrested for espionage. 
Achim allegedly obtained the classified data and transmitted it to Zikolov through a complex communication system. 
Later, Zikolov allegedly sent the documents to those described as "representatives of a non-allied state".
In other news, about 20,000 public servants took part in a two-hour warning strike Monday morning, affecting activity at 350 public institutions across the country. 
The strikers oppose the government's decision to cut overtime pay and bonuses. 
They say they will launch a general strike next week if their demands are not met.

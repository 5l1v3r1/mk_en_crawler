ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb county court heard from a protected witness Wednesday (20 July) in a case involving war crimes allegedly committed in 1991 against Serb civilians in Osijek. 
The court's investigative department head, Ratko Scekic, confirmed that an interview was conducted but refused to provide details. 
According to media reports, the witness is a local policeman who saw the murders of civilians ordered by the then chief of the National Defence Office in Osijek, Branimir Glavas. 
Currently a member of parliament, Glavas went on national television this week denying any involvement.

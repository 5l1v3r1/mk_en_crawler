TIRANA, Albania -- By a unanimous vote Thursday (March 11th), parliament adopted a resolution on visa liberalisation for Albanian citizens travelling to EU countries. 
The document urges Brussels to complete the liberalisation process this year. 
Socialist Party (SP) lawmakers attended the session and voted, thereby rebuking government officials who have accused them of thwarting the free movement of Albanians. 
The SP recently ended a six-month parliamentary boycott over what it views as manipulated elections in June 2009.

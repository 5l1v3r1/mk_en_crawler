ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced on Wednesday (March 24th) that Turkey is returning Ambassador Zergun Koruturk to Sweden, two weeks after calling him home for consultations after the Swedish parliament supported a resolution that branded the 1915 killing of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide. 
Koruturk "will return to work this week or in the beginning of next week at the latest," Davutoglu told Turkish television channel CNN Turk. 
He welcomed attempts by the Swedish government to distance itself from the "absurd" resolution, noting that Sweden is a key supporter of Turkey's EU membership bid.

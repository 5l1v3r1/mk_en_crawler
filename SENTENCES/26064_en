BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romania's EU Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner-designate Dacian Ciolos was approved unanimously for the post on Friday (January 15th) after his hearing at the European Parliament (EP) in Brussels.
"I can say that Dacian Ciolos is one of the few commissioner-designates to receive such support by the EP's specialised commission," said EP Agricultural Chairman Paolo de Castro.
"He was applauded twice during his hearing, he gave totally correct replies and he did his job amazingly well."
"I am very happy that Romanians have a commissioner who is so well prepared in such an important field," de Castro added.
Ciolos was Romania's agriculture minister between October 2007 and December 2008.

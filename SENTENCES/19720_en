SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts have begun excavating another mass grave in Kamenica, near the eastern Bosnian Serb town of Zvornik, the BiH Commission of Missing Persons announced on Thursday (October 25th).
The grave is expected to contain the remains of at least 20 people, probably Bosnian Muslim men, killed at Srebrenica in 1995.
A total of ten mass graves have been excavated at Kamenica since the end of the conflict, yielding several thousand sets of remains.

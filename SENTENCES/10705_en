PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's government signed agreements with the OSCE and UNMIK on Friday (8 October), enabling Serb refugees from Kosovo to participate in the province's 23 October parliamentary elections.
According to Serbian Minister for State and Local Government Zoran Loncar, the government "was not calling on Kosovo Serbs to take part in the elections but would not hinder all willing to take part either." In all, 15 polling stations will open on territory outside of Kosovo.
A similar agreement will be signed with Montenegro.
Also Friday, Serbian President Boris Tadic, one of the few Belgrade leaders officially backing election participation, said he had asked NATO for extra guarantees for Serbs in Kosovo.
He repeated a call for dialogue with all international parties involved in determining the province's final status.

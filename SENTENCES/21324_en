TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Tuesday (August 26th) denied Moscow's claims that Albania has supplied Georgia with weapons used in the latter's conflict with Russia.
"Georgia has had its own weapons and its army, which suffered an [act of] aggression.
I am not surprised by the accusation, which is a continuation of Moscow's stand against Albanians," Berisha said.

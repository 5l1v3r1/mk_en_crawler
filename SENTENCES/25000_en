ANKARA, Turkey -- The prosecution released eight army officers Tuesday (December 29th) who were arrested for suspected involvement in a plot to assassinate Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc, the Anadolu news agency reported. 
The arrests were made last week after two of them were caught monitoring an area near Arinc's house. 
Local media had linked the detentions to plans to assassinate Arinc. 
The army, however, dismissed those reports as premature and explained that the officers were arrested in the course of an investigation into "a military official suspected of leaking information".
In other news Tuesday, a Turkish court handed down six life sentences to a Kurd involved in the 2005 bombing at the Aegean resort of Kusadasi. 
Five people were killed and 13 were injured when a bomb exploded in a minibus ferrying tourists to the beach. 
Mehmet Keskin got a life sentence for each of the dead and one for separatist activities. 
In the course of the trial, he denied having planted the handmade bomb but admitted to being a member of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Liberal Democratic Party-Social Democratic Party (PDL-PSD) coalition announced on Monday (August 17th) the adoption of 32 anti-crisis measures.
They include abolishing taxes on profit and collecting about 500m euros for investments from a Eurobond issuance.
All of the measures will come into force as of September.
They are divided into two parts -- economic incentives and projects to boost economic competitiveness.
Last week, the IMF said Romania is in a severe recession, citing an economic contraction of up to 8.5% this year.

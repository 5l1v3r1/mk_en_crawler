BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Socialist Party of Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday (4 February) sided with Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and two other reformist parties to elect a speaker of the new Serbian Parliament. 
Dragan Marsicanin of the DSS was elected despite opposition by the Democratic Party. 
The Socialists also announced that they would support a government headed by Kostunica if it promises to block the current privatisation process and works to ban all extraditions of Serbs to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
EU security chief Javier Solana said the Union would still like to see democratic forces form a coalition government.
In other news, the loose union of Serbia-Montenegro marked its first anniversary on Wednesday. 
While Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic called the past 12 months "a lost year", Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic insisted that the new arrangement is working.

TIRANA, Albania -- The caucus of the ruling Socialist Party approved a bill Tuesday (6 May) concerning the status of royal family members. 
The draft law now moves to parliament for debate. 
It gives the royal family the right to hold diplomatic passports and enjoy the same immunity as legislators. 
In addition, royal family members will be entitled to protective services of the Republican Guard and will be included in the state protocol. 
However, the caucus did not approve any special privileges concerning restitution of property.

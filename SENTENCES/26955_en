BELGRADE, Serbia -- Workers with the maintenance company JAT Tehnika announced on Friday (October 2nd) they have cancelled a strike launched earlier in the week, now that JAT Airways has agreed to pay part of the back wages owed to its staff. 
The 900 employees went without paychecks because JAT Airways failed to pay 1.07m euros it owed the company for maintaining the aircraft. 
The strike forced Serbia's flag carrier to cancel flights. 
"We received an offer from JAT that is not fair, but, because of the passengers and the inconvenience the strike has caused, we decided to suspend the strike until Monday, October 5th, when we expect the promised amount to be paid to us," Tehnika's CEO Vlada Krunic said. 
The strike will resume if JAT fails to pay.

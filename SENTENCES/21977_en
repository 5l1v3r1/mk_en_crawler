LUXEMBOURG -- Macedonia's possible launching of EU accession talks this year sparked heated debate among European foreign ministers at a meeting Monday (June 16th) in Luxembourg.
The dispute began after Macedonia's neighbour, Greece, opposed Skopje's hopes to join the bloc because of the long-standing name dispute between the two countries.
The diplomats expressed concern over serious violations that occurred during Macedonia's June 1st snap elections and urged the government to punish those responsible.
They reiterated their commitment to Skopje's EU perspective but did not mention a concrete date for launching accession talks.
As for Serbia, the foreign ministers decided to propose to the EU Council an acceleration of Serbia's EU integration, including the granting of EU candidate status.
The Netherlands reportedly opposed the wording, but in the end, the original text was preserved.
Regarding Cyprus, the EU foreign ministers agreed to ease the economic isolation of the Turkish-controlled northern part of Cyprus in order to encourage reunification of the island.
The measures are aimed at boosting trade and the economic integration of the Turkish and Greek communities on the island.

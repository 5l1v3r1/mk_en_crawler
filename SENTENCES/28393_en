ZAGREB, Croatia -- The leadership of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) decided on Thursday (September 16th) to expel former Economy Minister Damir Polancec from the party for tarnishing its image. 
The decision came a couple of days after Polancec testified before a parliamentary inquiry commission investigating privatisation of the oil and gas company INA, and how Hungary's MOL acquired additional management rights last year. 
Polancec said that cabinet ministers and the HDZ's presidency were informed of the entire negotiation process. 
The party had suspended him from all HDZ duties immediately after his March arrest stemming from a shadowy affair involving local food producer Podravka.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Prime Minister Lubcho Georgievski said Saturday (28 December) the opposition plans to organise a protest during the New Year holidays. 
He said the major opposition party VMRO-DPMNE would launch a campaign for early parliamentary elections. 
Georgievski sharply criticised the current government and accused Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of collaborating with terrorist organisations. 
The Democratic Union for Integration, led by former rebel leader Ali Ahmeti, is currently a member of the ruling coalition.

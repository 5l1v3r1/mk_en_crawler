SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament will discuss a motion Monday (December 13th) filed by the opposition SDSM to dissolve parliament and call early elections, local media reported Thursday.
The main opposition party accuses the government of corruption and poor management.
The ruling VMRO-DMPNE, however, concluded at a meeting of its executive committee on Wednesday that there is no reason to call early elections.
The ethnic Albanian junior coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration believes that snap elections could delay the country's EU integration process.

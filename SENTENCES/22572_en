SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski's office issued a statement Friday (October 10th) criticising UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz's latest proposal to resolve the long-standing name dispute with Greece.
"Without serious changes, this set of ideas cannot serve as a basis for further negotiations and a resolution," the statement read.
Nimetz presented his latest ideas in New York last week.
His proposal envisions using the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia" internationally and a shortened version -- "North Macedonia"-- for use in the UN.
Greek media reported on Saturday that Athens is reassessing its stance on Nimetz's proposal in light of Crvenkovski's statement.
Earlier, Athens cautiously welcomed the ideas as "a very good basis for negotiations" that needed "improvements in certain areas".

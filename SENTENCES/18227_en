NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos said on Tuesday (January 16th) that any solution to the Cyprus issue must be based on reunification, which he described as the only functional and beneficial solution for both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island. 
Papadopoulos, who hosted a lunch for foreign media correspondents in Nicosia, stressed that reunification must involve "territory, society, economy and institutions". 
He added that while a UN-mediated plan, rejected by the Greek Cypriots in May 2004, is not dead, it needs adjustment.

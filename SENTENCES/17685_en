BERLIN, Germany -- The EU's 50th birthday declaration, adopted during a celebration summit in Berlin on Sunday (March 25th), highlighted the need to overhaul the Union on a "renewed common basis" by 2009, but did not explicitly mention a commitment to further enlargement.
The EU leaders did, however, voice their continued support for a policy of "openness".
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, whose country is engaged in EU accession negotiations, downplayed any concerns, saying he was convinced that Croatia is already perceived as the 28th member of the Union.

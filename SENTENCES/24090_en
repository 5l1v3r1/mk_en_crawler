ATHENS, Greece -- About 500 policemen took to the streets of Athens on Thursday (January 15th) to protest a series of violent attacks on colleagues across the country over the past several weeks. 
Supporting the demonstration were lawmakers from the ruling party (New Democracy), the main opposition party (PASOK) and the Radical Left Coalition. 
Weeks of sporadic violence have followed the December 6th killing of a 15-year-old by a police officer.
Separately Thursday, more than 2,000 high school and university students protested in downtown Athens against police violence and the government's planned education reforms, including spending cuts. 
Protesters gathered outside the University of Athens before marching to the parliament building.

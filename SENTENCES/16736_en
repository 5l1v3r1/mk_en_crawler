TIRANA, Albania -- An ad hoc parliamentary committee, due to investigate Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, failed to hold its first meeting Monday (8 May), because representatives of the opposition refused to participate until the Constitutional Court rules on the matter. 
The main opposition Socialist Party has approached the Court, asking it to assess the legality of the parliamentary majority's decision on 2 May to establish an inquiry committee for Sollaku. 
The ruling Democratic Party is pressing for his dismissal, citing alleged links to organised crime.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sven Fredriksen, the Danish chief of the EU police mission in BiH, died of a heart attack early Monday (26 January). 
He was 56. 
Fredriksen took part in UN peacekeeping operations during the 1992-1995 war in BiH and led UN police operations in Kosovo after the 1999 conflict. 
He went on to head the UN international police in BiH and oversaw its replacement last year with an EU police force. 
EU security chief Javier Solana issued a statement saying the success of the mission in BiH was largely due to Fredriksen's leadership.

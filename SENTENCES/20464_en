ZAGREB, Croatia -- The potentially key coalition of the Croatian Peasant Party and Social Liberal Party (HSS-HSLS) remains undecided over supporting the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) or the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).
Djurdja Adlesic, chairman of HSS, said on Monday (September 10th) that no decision is expected until after the November general elections, and any move would depend on the offer of the winning party.
SDP leads in the polls but would need a coalition partner to form a government.

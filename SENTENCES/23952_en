SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security Minister Tarik Sadovic has asked the local Interpol office to contact the international police organisation's headquarters in Lyon and ask it to withdraw arrest warrants issued for several people from BiH, local media reported on Sunday (May 17th).
Serbia had confirmed on Saturday that Interpol-Serbia has issued international arrest warrants for 19 Bosniaks suspected of 1992 war crimes against Serbians in Sarajevo.
According to BiH authorities, the warrants are politically motivated.
Sarajevo insists BiH citizens should face justice at home rather than abroad.

NEW YORK, United States -- Another effort to resolve the long-standing name dispute between Greece and Macedonia ended without any result in New York on Saturday (March 1st). 
UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz said neither Skopje nor Athens accepted his latest proposal. 
It was based on a double-formula -- one constitutional name for use in bilateral communications with Greece, and another to be applied in relations with international organisations and as a constitutional name for internal use.
On Friday, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis urged Skopje to give up its "relentless stance" and threatened that unless it does so, Athens will veto the country's NATO bid .After the talks Saturday, Macedonian negotiator Nikola Dimitrov said his country could not sacrifice its national identity in return for a NATO invitation.
Separately Saturday, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said he expects Macedonia and Greece to demonstrate flexibility.

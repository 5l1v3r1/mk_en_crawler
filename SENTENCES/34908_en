SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski delivered his annual address to parliament on Thursday (18 December), touching on all major priorities, including implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, improving the security situation and progress in preparations for NATO and EU membership. 
Yet he criticised the multiethnic coalition government, accusing it of inefficient and politicised work, citing in particular the recently approved decentralisation law package and the bill legalising the ethnic Albanian university in Tetovo. 
The local media described the speech as part of Trajkovski's pre-election campaign and a bid to win support from the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE ahead of the 2004 presidential election.

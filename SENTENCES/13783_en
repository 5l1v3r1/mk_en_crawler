ANKARA, Turkey -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was scheduled to arrive in Turkey on Monday (19 December) for talks with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and Defence Minister Mehmet Vecdi Gonul. 
The NATO chief is also expected to deliver a speech at Bilkent University in Ankara.
In other news, Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan confirmed on Friday that the government is planning stricter measures and penalties against the grey economy. 
Unakitan says that the country loses some $12 billion annually to it.
Meanwhile, written arguments released on Sunday suggest that Iran is training Islamic militants and supporting terrorist acts aimed at bringing down Turkey's secular order. 
The charges are contained in the court's ruling in a case against nine extremists who were convicted of killing four secular intellectuals in the 1990s.

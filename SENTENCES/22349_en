THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at The Hague tribunal sought a 15-year prison sentence Wednesday (June 11th) for former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Army Commander Rasim Delic, who faces charges of failing to prevent war crimes by mujahedeen units under his command between 1993 and 1995.
Prosecutor Darryl Mundis said that contrary to defence claims, Delic maintained effective control over units whose members committed war crimes against Serbs and Croats.
Delic did nothing to prevent the crimes or to punish the guilty, although he knew that members of the mujahedeen unit "were prone to committing crimes".
According to prosecutors, Delic is responsible for the deaths of around 60 Serb soldiers and many Croatian prisoners of war.
He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.

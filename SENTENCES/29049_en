BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Quickly settling the immovable defence property issue will boost Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) efforts to join NATO, Alliance Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Thursday (October 7th). 
"I commend the people and government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the smooth and peaceful conduct of the [October 3rd general and presidential] elections. 
I hope that the elected leaders will work to find common ground and pursue reform, which is essential to help the country move closer to Euro-Atlantic integration," Rasmussen said in a congratulatory address.

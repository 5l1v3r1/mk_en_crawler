SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The top US commander in BiH has confirmed plans for the pullout of the last 150 US soldiers serving in the Balkan country. 
General Louis Weber said on Friday (22 September) that with the EU-led military mission now firmly in place, there is no longer a need for the US troops. 
Some 100 US military personnel will continue to serve with the NATO headquarters at Sarajevo. 
Asked about the hunt for Radovan Karadzic, he said there was no conclusive evidence Karadzic is in the country.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Five people died on Saturday (August 30th) when their car was hit by a train at a railway crossing near the southeast town of Fetesti. 
Police say the 19-year-old driver was speeding and lost control of the vehicle. 
No one was hurt in the train but the incident closed railway traffic along the Bucharest-Black Sea line for four hours.
Separately, an off-duty US soldier was injured by a rubber bullet during a fight between four US troops and a group of Romanian rock fans on motor bikes in the Mamaia resort early Saturday. 
According to a witness, the two groups first threw stones and bottles at each other. 
Police spokesperson Radu Croitoru says the rockers shot four rubber bullets at the soldiers, injuring one of them in the foot, arm and stomach. 
A NATO military exercise in the region involves four ships, including one from the US Navy.

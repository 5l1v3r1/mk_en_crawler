SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to Sarajevo Charles English said on Thursday (August 14th) he sees no will for constitutional reform in the country. 
During a TV interview, English said three plans circulate among the political parties: creation of a unitary state, preservation of the Dayton Accords structure and establishment of a third entity, but none of them is viable. 
He again rejected recent media speculation that Washington has initiated consultations with parties on the new BiH constitution, as for the time being, it would lead to nowhere. 
The parties are to start talks on constitutional reform after local elections on October 5th.

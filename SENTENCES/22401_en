NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkey wants to join the EU, but it is not ready to achieve that goal "at all costs", Turkish State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said Friday (November 14th) in Nicosia. 
"No one can force us to choose between Cyprus and the EU," Cicek stressed. 
"Without Turkey's contribution, the problems in the Middle East and the Caucasus cannot be solved," he said of the EU's strategic aspirations. 
Despite EU pressure, Ankara refuses to give Cypriot vessels access to its harbours and airports as it has not recognised the Republic of Cyprus.

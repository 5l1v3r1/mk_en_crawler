BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told reporters on Monday (July 9th) that Turkey has moved 140,000 troops to the interstate border between the countries. 
According to Zebari, the deployment was part of a "great mobilisation", which he said is related to Turkey's threats for a unilateral cross-border action against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps in northern Iraq. 
Although the Iraqi authorities understand Turkey's "legitimate fears over the PKK activities", Zebari said, the issue should be settled via dialogue and the joint efforts of Iraq, Turkey and the United States.
According to the international press, US State Department and Pentagon representatives were unable to confirm Zebari's claims. 
The US officials again called for Ankara to restrain from any unilateral military moves into Iraq.

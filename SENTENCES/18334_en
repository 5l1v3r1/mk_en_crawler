PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Former Parliament Speaker Nedzhat Daci reportedly has left the ruling Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and formed a new party. 
According to media reports Friday (January 12th), Daci's departure from LDK follows a growing rift between him and the circle around Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu. 
Daci says the new party, the Democratic Union, will pursue the policies of the late President Ibrahim Rugova.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- President Danilo Turk met with visiting Macedonian counterpart Gjorge Ivanov on Monday (May 18th) and assured him that Slovenia will continue to support Skopje's bid to join the EU and NATO. 
During their talks in Ljubljana, Turk also voiced support for UN mediator Matthew Nimetz's efforts to resolve Macedonia's long-standing name dispute with Greece. 
Ivanov, who just took office, said he expects negotiations to intensify after the European Parliament elections in Greece next month. 
"Our wish is to find a reasonable compromise that will not hurt Macedonian state interests," Ivanov told reporters.

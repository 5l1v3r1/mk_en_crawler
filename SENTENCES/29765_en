PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The municipality of Hani i Elezit/Elez Han is preparing a lawsuit against the state of Serbia for war crimes. 
Local authorities approved the initiative on Thursday (January 27th) and a commission has been established to gather evidence and lead the process. 
Still unclear is the period that the lawsuit will cover, but it will likely focus on the last decade of Serbia's regime in Kosovo, from 1989 to the end of the war in 1999. 
Hani i Elezit/Elez Han is a small municipality in eastern Kosovo, near the Macedonian border. 
The lawsuit will mention crimes against the civilian population committed by Serb police, military and paramilitary forces.

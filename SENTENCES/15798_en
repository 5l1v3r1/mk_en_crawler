BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu criticised the government of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, accusing it of "mediocre functionality" and a reluctance to restructure itself, during a speech to parliament Monday (19 June). 
In his first parliamentary address since assuming the presidency in December 2004, Basescu insisted that Romanian institutions must be reformed and brought up to standards close to the European ones by 2007, when the country hopes to join the EU.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said Thursday (March 8th) that if Slovenia agrees to an arbitration procedure on its border with Croatia, the case should encompass the entire border, not only maritime areas.
The two countries have been unable to reach agreement on fishing rights in the Adriatic since the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Recently, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader indicated that Croatia could bring the case to an international arbitration court, but Slovenia vigorously opposed the move.
Sanader said he is prone to accept the Slovenian proposal, saying that if arbitration on the entire border was "a condition to go before an international judicial body, where we would finally close the Savudrija Bay issue, then why not?" (Vecernji List - 09/03/07;

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At an extraordinary meeting in Mostar on Sunday (October 28th), leaders of the eight largest parties in BiH sealed a declaration to unblock police reform, the main obstacle to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
They agreed that the police should be restructured in line with the three EU principles -- organisation at state-level, financing from a single budget and no political interference.
However, they did not directly address the two main sources of dispute -- preservation of the Republika Srpska police force and whether or not the new police regions should cross entity lines.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak also attended the meeting and is awaiting an assessment of the declaration by the European Commission.

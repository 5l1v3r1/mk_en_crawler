BUCHAREST, Romania -- Buses and trams in Bucharest came to a halt Thursday (April 1st) after thousands of drivers staged a strike without advance warning.
They were protesting government austerity measures that would cut their wages and Easter bonuses.
The only public transportation that continued was the subway, which had to boost capacity to handle the crowds.
Bucharest Public Transport Company Director Gheorghe Aron assured the protestors that basic salaries will not be cut.
The company has decided to hike fares beginning May 1st to raise more revenue.

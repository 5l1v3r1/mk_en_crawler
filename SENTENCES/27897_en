TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers and supporters of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) ended their 19-day hunger strike on Wednesday (May 19th) after political leaders agreed to hold talks and end the crisis. 
SP leader Edi Rama said his party will meet with government representatives in Strasbourg on Thursday for talks mediated by European officials, including EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele. 
Still, he warned that ending the strike does not mean an end to the SP's demand for transparency. 
The SP has for months insisted on an investigation into the June 2009 general elections, which they say were marred by numerous violations.

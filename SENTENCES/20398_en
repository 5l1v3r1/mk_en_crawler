SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- British Ambassador to BiH Matthew Rycroft downplayed on Tuesday (September 11th) the possibility of establishing a third entity in BiH, as well as the possibility that Republika Srpska would be abolished as an entity.
Both changes would require constitutional reform and a two-thirds majority in parliament, he noted, saying this would be difficult to achieve in the current political climate.
Some Croats have backed the idea of a third entity to represent their interests.
In phone discussions with officials Tuesday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic voiced his support for maintaining the status quo.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Council of Ministers has asked the Union's candidate countries -- Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia -- to freeze the assets of UN war crimes tribunal indictees Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Ante Gotovina.
It has made the same request of Stabilisation and Association Process members and candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro, as well as EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
Thursday's (21 October) move is intended to aid the arrest of the tribunal's three most wanted indictees.
Authorities in BiH, Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia said they will comply with the request.

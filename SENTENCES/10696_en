SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Deputy Prime Minister Musa Xhaferri returned from Brussels on Tuesday (7 September) saying the EU respects the people's desire to hold a referendum on the country's new decentralisation laws, but stresses the significance of the decentralisation process as part of the Ohrid Peace Agreement. 
Xhaferri says he was told the issue could have consequences for the EU integration process.
French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, who visited Skopje Tuesday, delivered a similar message. 
Speaking with Macedonian counterpart Ilinka Mitreva, Barnier said the country is on the right track and should not follow those who want to remove it from the path to EU membership.

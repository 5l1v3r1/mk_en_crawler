PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU believes it has found a formula that would allow all heads of state in the Western Balkans to attend an upcoming summit in Sarajevo.
Visiting Pristina on Wednesday (April 28th), Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the so-called Gymnich model will apply, which means participants will not hold symbols or other state trappings.
In the past, Serbian President Boris Tadic has refused to attend events alongside his Kosovo counterpart, insisting that would implicitly acknowledge Kosovo's independence.

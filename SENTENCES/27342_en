PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police arrested Nazim Bllaca late Monday (November 30th), after he publicly admitted that he had committed murder and participated in 17 cases of attempted murder. 
Bllaca, 37, said on Sunday that several senior state, party and police officials are involved in the criminal cases in which he has provided witness testimony. 
Bllaca, who claims to be a former agent of the Kosovo Information Service (SHIK), an intelligence agency with suspected links to the ruling Democratic Party (PDK), was questioned by the Special Prosecutor's Office and later handcuffed by EULEX police. 
He is suspected of murder and participating in organised crime.
Three people Bllaca has implicated -- PDK lawmaker Xhavit Haliti, PDK presidency member Azem Syla, and Fahredin Gashi, described by Bllaca as a SHIK agent -- deny the accusations. 
Gashi describes Bllaca as unbalanced. 
"Nobody is above the law," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said, promising that a thorough investigation would be conducted.

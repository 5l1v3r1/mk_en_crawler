SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown welcomed on Friday (8 July) the Republika Srpska government's intention to resume talks on police reform with the Federation of BiH government and BiH Council of Ministers. 
Ashdown reiterated that police restructuring represents the last significant stumbling block on BiH's road to Europe. 
Political agreement on police reforms must be tabled and forwarded to the parliaments by the middle of September in order to start negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement by the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement.

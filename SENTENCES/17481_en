WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States welcomed on Tuesday (January 30th) a suggestion by Saif Al Islam Gaddafi, son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, to resolve the case involving Bulgarian and Palestinian medics, sentenced to death in Libya in a controversial HIV infection case. 
The younger Gaddafi, who runs a humanitarian foundation, recently told a leading Bulgarian newspaper that there is a plan that would satisfy all involved -- Bulgaria, Libya, the families of the infected children and the EU -- and that the medics would not be executed. 
On Tuesday, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said this would be good news, if true.
Also Tuesday, the Bulgarian lawyers representing the five nurses confirmed that the defence is focusing on appealing the death sentences, issued in December.

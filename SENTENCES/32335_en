BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Yugoslav government Thursday (31 October) admitted that there have been violations of restrictions against arms sales to Iraq, and banned all "military economic co-operation" with states that are subject to international sanctions. 
Ministers promised that new regulations would be developed as soon as possible and that the federal government will issue licenses for every future transaction. 
The move came after investigators uncovered evidence that Yugoslavia's Jugoimport defence company had acted as an intermediary in a deal involving the overhaul of Iraqi MiG-21 and 23 engines by Bosnian Serb firm Orao.

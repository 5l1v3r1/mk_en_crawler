SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's main political parties agreed on constitutional reforms Saturday (18 March) that would improve the efficiency of central institutions.
Such reforms are a requirement for closer ties with the EU.
The leaders of the seven main ruling and opposition parties agreed to strengthen the nine-member central government by adding two new portfolios and by empowering the prime minister to hire and fire cabinet members.
They also agreed to create a streamlined parliament.
The three-member presidency would be replaced by a single president and two deputies, all of whom would be elected by parliament.
High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling described the agreement as the first substantial step on the long road toward efficient and functioning state institutions.
The United States played a key role during the negotiations.

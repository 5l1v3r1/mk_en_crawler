SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski announced on Saturday (January 10th) the country will hold presidential and local elections on March 22nd. 
The polls will be the fourth set of elections in the country since it proclaimed independence in 1991. 
The parliament speaker stressed the elections will be crucial for the country's EU prospects. 
"A free and democratic vote is the most important thing for our further integration into the EU. 
[â¦] Otherwise, we will remain a black hole in the Balkans," he warned. 
Last year, violence and fraud marred parliamentary elections. 
The EU said then proper conduct of the next elections would be a key condition for the country's further integration progress.
Meanwhile Friday, parliament approved a constitutional amendment to lower the minimum turnout required for a presidential election from 50% to 40%. 
All 86 lawmakers present voted for the amendment.

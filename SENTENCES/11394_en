SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Rasim Delic, 56, the former commander of the Bosnian Muslim army between 1993 and 1995, will surrender to the UN tribunal on Monday (28 February).
In a televised statement, he said he decided to travel to The Hague as soon as he learned that he had been indicted for atrocities committed against Serbs by a unit of foreign Islamic fighters called El Mujaheed.
Delic is currently an adviser to the Muslim member of the BiH presidency.
Also Monday, two days of talks began in Neum between the main political parties in BiH.
However, the Bosniak Party for BiH decided not to participate, saying the agenda was too controversial.

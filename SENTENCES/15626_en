BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives (CNSAS) has screened the records of 71 parliament members, looking for possible collaboration with the Communist-era security services, according to local press reports Tuesday (22 August). 
Next, the panel is expected to start hearings into the 29 politicians with suspected links to Securitate. 
Their files were declassified and submitted by the Romanian Intelligence Service to CNSAS earlier this month.
In other news, Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu has begun approving layoffs among ministry state secretaries, in line with the ruling coalition's recent agreement to downsize the number of lower-ranked government personnel. 
The restructuring plan envisions cutting the number of state secretaries from 82 to 52, to boost efficiency.

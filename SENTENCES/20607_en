BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court sentenced three neo-Nazis to between 10 and 25 days in prison Tuesday (October 9th) over Sunday's clash with anti-fascists in Novi Sad.
Police detained a total of 56 members of the Nacionalni Stroj (National Guard) movement.
Eleven of them, all Slovak citizens, have been deported.
The court decided to release 14 other neo-Nazis, while an investigation into the rest continues.
The neo-Nazis lobbed rocks at protestors staging a demonstration against fascism outside their headquarters Sunday, injuring several.

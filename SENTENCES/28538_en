BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government survived a vote of no confidence on Tuesday (June 15th), with 139 votes cast in favour of the cabinet and 228 against it.
In order for the vote to have been successful, the opposition needed 236 votes, or 50% + 1 vote of all lawmakers.
As expected, some members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) decided to defect, voting against the cabinet's controversial austerity measures, which include cutting salaries in the public sector by 25% and pensions by 15%.
The plans are now to be drafted into legislation.
During the vote, an estimated 5,000 people protested outside the parliament building.
Around 1,000 police officers were deployed to keep them from entering parliament.

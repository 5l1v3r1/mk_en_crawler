TIRANA, Albania -- Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic met with Albanian counterpart Kastriot Islami on Wednesday (22 December) and said he supports dialogue with the Kosovo government, adding that the Serbian government respects the results of the free elections in the province. 
Commenting on the appointment of Ramush Haradinaj as Kosovo prime minister, Draskovic said that if The Hague tribunal indicts Haradinaj, the international community and Haradinaj himself would respect international laws. 
Draskovic also met with Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who said bilateral ties should be strengthened to demonstrate the countries' commitment to regional stability and Euro-Atlantic integration.

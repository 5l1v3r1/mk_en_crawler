SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An international team headed by SFOR will monitor the investigation of the Orao arms trading scandal by Republika Srpska (RS) authorities. 
The Office of the High Representative (OHR) announced Thursday (5 December) that the task force will include the OHR, the OSCE and other relevant international institutions. 
Earlier, the chief international officials in BiH sent a letter to RS President Dragan Cavic, expressing disappointment with the results of the RS government's preliminary probe into Orao's illegal arm exports to Iraq. 
The international community says it expects RS to issue its final report, addressing all relevant issues, by 3 January.

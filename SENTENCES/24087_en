PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police announced on Thursday (July 16th) that former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) staged a violent protest in front of the government building, demanding better living conditions. 
At least 20 protestors tossed Molotov cocktails at the building in Pristina, though no property damage was reported. 
The demonstrators warned of further protests if their demands are not met. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu said that while he would support any peaceful protest, "attacks against state institutions threatening public safety are condemned." (Kohavision, RTK, Telegrafi, BBC, VOA, Kosovalive - 16/07/09)

ANKARA, Turkey -- Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul met Monday (24 March) with his Italian counterpart Antonio Martino and said afterwards that co-operation between Turkey and Italy is important to security and stability in the Mediterranean region. 
The two ministers discussed bilateral co-operation within the framework of NATO membership, regional security issues and the ongoing war in Iraq, as well as concrete measures for fighting against terrorism and organised crime. 
Since Italy assumes the rotating EU presidency in July, its support for Turkey's membership aspirations is important.

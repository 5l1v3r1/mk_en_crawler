SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency met in emergency session on Friday (November 2nd) to discuss the resignation of BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric.
They decided to consult with him "as soon as circumstances allow", according to Presidency chairman Zeljko Komsic, in hopes of talking him out of it.
Electing s successor would take months of negotiations among various parties.
Spiric resigned on Thursday after the Peace Implementation Council ignored his objections to the latest set of measures imposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, aimed at boosting the work of parliament and the central government.
Lajcak on Friday insisted that the current crisis in BiH is artificially caused and denied that his actions were aimed at harming Bosnian Serbs.
According to Lajcak, the measures are in line with the Dayton Peace Accords, the BiH Constitution and his own mandate.

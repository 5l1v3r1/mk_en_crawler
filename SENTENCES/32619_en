THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided Friday (28 February) to release an ethnic Albanian suspect after prosecutors were unable to establish whether he was the man they wanted for war crimes.
Agim Murtezi was set free after interviews with him and material collected from his home suggested his was a case of mistaken identity, and that he was not the former KLA member prosecutors wanted for torture and murder at a guerrilla-run prison camp in 1998.
Murtezi insisted he did not know the other two suspects in the case, Haradin Bala and Isak Musliu, something Bala confirmed in a written statement.
The UN court also agreed to grant early release to a Bosnian Serb who was serving a five-year sentence in an Austrian jail.
Damir Dosen pleaded guilty in 2001 to running Prijedor's Keraterm camp, where many Bosnian Muslims and Croats were held in 1992.
The tribunal granted his release because of "the genuine remorse he expressed on various occasions, his co-operation with the office of the prosecutor and his exemplary behaviour during detention." Including the time he spent in detention at The Hague, Dosen served a total of three years and four months.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of the EU Political and Security Committee (PSC) met with High Representative Valentin Inzko in Sarajevo on Thursday (December 2nd).
Inzko said the ongoing political stalemate in BiH should be overcome and stressed that the country must quickly establish a government that would make a new start in the wake of the October 3rd general elections.
He added that the recent decision to allow BiH citizens to travel freely within the EU is not just a "warm welcome" on the road to integration, but also a sign that BiH is able to meet international conditions when its leaders are willing to work.
The PSC representatives are on a two-day visit to Sarajevo for meetings with political leaders, judiciary members, NGOs and EU agencies.
They said during the meeting with Inzko that the bloc remains committed to strengthening the functionality, prosperity and modern democratic development of BiH.

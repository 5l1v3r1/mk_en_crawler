PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK head Michael Steiner met with Kosovo Serb politicians on Wednesday (5 March) to discuss potential dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
Steiner and representatives of the Return coalition expressed general agreement that talks are needed.
However, the Serb politicians said they support Belgrade's position, which is that preliminary consultations should be held before official talks begin.
EU security chief Javier Solana, who met with federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic in Brussels, also spoke in favour of a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.

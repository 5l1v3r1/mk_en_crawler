PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local elections scheduled for November 15th will be held without surveillance cameras at polling stations, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said on Monday (August 24th).
The institution explained that installing cameras would be too expensive and would require more time than is available.
The CEC also refused to install cameras at the main counting stations.
Both requests were made by opposition parties who insist surveillance will boost transparency in the election process.

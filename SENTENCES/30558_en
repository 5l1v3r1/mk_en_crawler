SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU would be willing to discuss judicial reforms in BiH if Republika Srpska (RS) postpones or revokes its decision to hold a referendum, Charge d'Affaires of the European Delegation to BiH Boris Iarochevitch said on Tuesday (May 10th). 
High Representative Valentin Inzko set Thursday as a deadline to drop the referendum plan. 
The RS parliament decided on April 13th to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office, claiming the two institutions are biased against Serbs.

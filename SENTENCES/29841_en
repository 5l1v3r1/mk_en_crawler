SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia City Court convicted on Tuesday (January 25th) the former head of the tax agency, Maria Murgina. 
She was sentenced to four years in prison for abuse of power and filing false statements. 
Murgina served as director of the National Revenue Agency between 2005 and 2009, when she was forced to resign amid accusations of covering up fraud by businessmen who used fake companies to siphon millions from the state budget. 
Murgina has two weeks to appeal the sentence.

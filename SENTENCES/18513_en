BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ruling coalition parties in Serbia -- President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, and G17 Plus -- want to hold presidential and local elections in October, assuming the UN Security Council approves the continuation of Kosovo negotiations, the daily Blic newspaper reported Wednesday (July 11th).
However, if there are no new negotiations and Kosovo's status is settled quickly, elections would reportedly be called in February or March 2008.
Blic says all three parties would support DS leader Boris Tadic in his bid for re-election.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu said on Monday (September 3rd) that Romania should not choose between the EU and the United States.
Instead, as an EU member, it should try to strengthen relations with the United States and support Trans-Atlantic dialogue, he said.
Cioroianu was outlining foreign policy goals in a speech to Romania's diplomatic corps.
Also addressing Romania's diplomats, President Traian Basescu said that while he does not favour independence for Kosovo, Romania will accept the international community's decision on the matter.
He suggested that Serbia has every legal right to demand jurisdiction over Kosovo.

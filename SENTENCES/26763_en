PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Steering Group (ISG) on Kosovo praised on Monday (October 5th) achievements in the implementation of the decentralisation process and the preparations made for the upcoming local elections on November 15th.
At a meeting in Pristina, the ISG urged local institutions to include minorities and especially the Serb community in the decentralisation and elections processes in order for the Comprehensive Settlement Proposal, or the Supervised Independence, to be successful.
The ISG guides Kosovo's democratic development and promotes good governance, multi-ethnicity and the rule of law in accordance with the Ahtisaari plan on independence.
The group of 25 representatives urged more engagement for strengthening the rule of law, regional cooperation, and improvement of the business environment.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Diyarbakir on Thursday (November 20th) sentenced a mayor to 15 months in prison for making a statement in support of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Ahmet Ertak is mayor of the Sirnak district in one of the municipalities in southeastern Sirnak province, which is a scene of frequent clashes between PKK members and the Turkish military.
The court found him guilty of terrorist propaganda.
According to the indictment, in a report aired by the France-24 TV channel, Ertak sought help for the PKK, which Turkey, the EU and the United States consider a terrorist organisation.

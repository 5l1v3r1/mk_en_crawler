BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Thursday (August 19th) that Greece has met the conditions required to receive the next 9 billion-euro tranche of its 110 billion-euro aid package.
The EC said it expects eurozone members to approve allocation of the funds.
The issue is to be discussed by eurozone finance ministers at their September 7th meeting in Brussels.
EU and IMF experts concluded earlier this month that Greece has made considerable progress in implementing much-needed austerity measures.
On Thursday, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn praised Greece's progress in implementing the reforms but warned "challenges and risks remain".

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Mediation has failed to result in a compromise on the Kosovo president issue among political parties, local media reported on Wednesday (April 6th). 
Facilitated by US Ambassador Christopher Dell and the head of International Civilian Office Pieter Feith, discussions are under way with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, opposition Democratic League of Kosovo leader Isa Mustafa and former president and junior government coalition partner Behgjet Pacolli. 
International diplomats are urging Thaci and Mustafa to reach a compromise on electing a president, to pave the way for electoral system reforms and constitutional changes. 
Political parties are to meet again on Wednesday.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government of Cyprus is asking Syria to explain why it allowed the docking of a ferry that sailed from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is only recognised by Turkey. 
The vessel sailed on Saturday (September 22nd) in the presence of officials from Turkish Cypriot's foreign ministry, journalists and businessmen. 
Syrian officials greeted it when it arrived in port.
Greek Cypriot government spokesman Vassilis Palmas said Monday that Nicosia wants to know whether regular ferry service will be launched between Syrian and Turkish Cypriot shores, despite previous assurances to the contrary.

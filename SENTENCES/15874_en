THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, and Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic signed an agreement Wednesday (19 July) in The Hague granting the Serbian prosecution access to the UN tribunal's archives. 
Serbian authorities will now be able to read over half a million evidence and investigation materials related to war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. 
Vukcevic said the accord shows that the court acknowledges the professionalism of Serbian prosecutors, and trusts in their ability to impartially and independently prosecute war crimes.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A referendum on building an oil refinery in Smederevo has failed due to low turnout. 
According to preliminary results, only 11.64% of registered voters went to the polls Sunday (August 8th). 
The referendum was held at the initiative of the opposition parties in town -- the Democratic Party of Serbia, the Serbian Radical Party, the Serbian Progressive Party and the Coalition for a Better Smederevo. 
They were able to collect enough signatures to call the vote, citing environmental concerns. 
The refinery in Smederevo's industrial zone would employ 700 people. 
The investment by the American-Dutch Comico Oil consortium is worth $250m.

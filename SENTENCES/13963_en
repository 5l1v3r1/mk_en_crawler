SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's special war crimes court has indicted 11 people for alleged involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, a spokeswoman said Thursday (15 December). 
A decision on whether the cases should go to trial is to be made early next week.
In other news, a Croatian court sentenced six Serbs to prison terms of six to 14 years for their role in atrocities committed in Vukovar at the start of the 1991-1995 conflict. 
The six defendants were first tried in 2004, but the Croatian Supreme Court overturned the verdicts citing procedural errors. 
Three of the men, all former Serb militia members, were tried in absentia.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian State Prosecutor Ilie Botos has resigned, his office said Friday (21 July). 
Local media reports said he likely stepped down over disappearance of a Syrian businessman, Omar Hayssam, accused of masterminding the 2005 abduction of three Romanian journalists in Iraq. 
The heads of Romania's three intelligence services resigned earlier in the week, citing their failure in the Hayssam case. 
The businessman, who was released from custody for health reasons, has been missing since the end of June and is believed to have fled the country.

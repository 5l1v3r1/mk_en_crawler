BOCHUM, Germany -- A former UN employee who served with the Kosovo Electricity Company went on trial Monday (28 April), charged with stealing $4.2m. 
Joe Trutschler, a German citizen, was accused of moving funds from the company's larger than expected 2001-2002 profits to private accounts in Gibraltar. 
He maintains that he set the money aside to raise the wages of local employees.

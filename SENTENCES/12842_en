SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The nephew of former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel reportedly was one of three Turkish citizens arrested in an operation by Bulgarian border police in Bourgas late last week. 
According to media reports Monday (3 January), Yahya Murat Demirel, former co-owner of the bankrupt Egebank, was detained with two other passengers on a Turkish ship after they presented forged identity documents to Bulgarian border authorities and allegedly tried to bribe the officers. 
Police say the ship carried large amounts of smuggled medicines.
In other news Monday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy arrived in Chile, the first such visit since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations in 1935. 
Passy and Chilean counterpart Ignacio Walker sealed three co-operation agreements.

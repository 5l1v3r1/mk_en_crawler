BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The trial of six Serbs indicted for war crimes committed in Zvornik in 1992 began at a special court in Belgrade Monday (28 November). 
The six -- Branko Grujic, Branko Popovic, Dragan Slavkovic, Ivan Korac, Sinisa Filipovic and Dragutin Dragicevic Bosanec -- are charged with killing or expelling Bosnian Muslim civilians from the Zvornik region in May-July 1992. 
A seventh defendant, Dusko Vuckovic, died last week at the Belgrade Central Prison.

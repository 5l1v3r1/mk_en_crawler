STRASBOURG, France -- The new government in Croatia will not result in a new EU approach towards the country, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Wednesday (14 January) after meeting a number of EU officials. 
He quoted EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten as saying that the European Commission had a clear message for the new government, identical to all previous commitments to Croatia's accession. 
Sanader quoted EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen as saying he appreciates policy messages from the new government, especially concerning co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In other news Wednesday, Croatia and neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) began discussing possible amendments to their bilateral free trade agreement. 
BiH has postponed some parts that were originally scheduled to take effect at the beginning of this month.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH education ministries and the international community agreed Monday (14 October) on a document outlining strategic goals of education reform. 
Six working groups presented draft texts on access to education, non-discrimination, education financing, and management and reform of education legislation. 
The document will be presented to the Peace Implementation Council next month in Brussels. 
The aim of the reforms is to co-ordinate with EU standards so that diplomas obtained by BiH students can be recognised abroad.
In other news, the SFOR unit from Germany plans to leave BiH at the end of October. 
It will participate in other missions, such as Kosovo or Afghanistan, returning if necessary.

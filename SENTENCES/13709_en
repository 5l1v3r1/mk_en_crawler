BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania and Hungary signed 15 agreements on collaboration at an unprecedented joint session of the Romanian and Hungarian governments in Bucharest on Thursday (20 October).
The accords reportedly would facilitate procedures for trans-border railway traffic, ease the Romanian-Hungarian state border regime in light of eventual EU membership for Romania, and address the problem of refugees.
Officials also reached an agreement regarding the environment and protection against floods, a defence-related agreement, and one in which a Romanian-Hungarian public foundation would be established.
Dozens of officials participated in the meeting chaired by the prime ministers of the two countries, Calin Popescu Tariceanu and Ferenc Gyurcsany.

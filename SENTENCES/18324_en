TIRANA, Albania -- The government has condemned the bomb explosion at a Tirana restaurant early Thursday (February 15th) morning, shortly after Socialist Party (SP) leader and incumbent Tirana Mayor Edi Rama left the facility with five other SP members.
The blast has again ratcheted up tensions ahead of Sunday's municipal elections, in which Rama is seeking a third term.
He has said he does not want to believe his political opponents were behind the blast.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party, denounced the incident and indicated it may have been part of an ongoing feud between the current and former owners of the restaurant.

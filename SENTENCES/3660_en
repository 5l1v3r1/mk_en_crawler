In line with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement requirement, Croatia's parliament recently moved to end unlimited, duty-free sugar exports to the EU market.
The new duty-free export quota is 180,000 tonnes of sugar annually.
Any excess amount will be subject to taxation.
Opposition parties have objected to the quota, warning that three Croatian sugar factories will become bankrupt due to the government's compliance with the EU demands.
They estimate that the Croatian sugar industry faces billions of euros in losses, with farmers likely to be the worst hurt.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has come under fire personally for agreeing to the restriction.
Bozidar Pankretic, chairman of the Committee for Agriculture and Forestry, argues that the new export quota should not be less than the amount of sugar produced on 30,000 hectares of land.
"With the new sugar export limitation at 180,000 tonnes, Croatia will have one sugar factory out of business," Pankretic said, claiming that the quota will limit domestic production as well.
But Agriculture Minister Petar Cobankovic defends the government's decision.
Croatia already exports only 120,000 tonnes of sugar to the EU per year, he says, so the quota will cause no damage at all.
According to him, the new export quota will not jeopardise the domestic sugar production, as Croatia has established good negotiating relations with the European Commission.
Indeed, Cobankovic says, the agreement with the EU has not upset Croatian sugar producers, even though it has rattled opposition politicians.
"The agreement puts Croatia's agriculture in a better position in that it will not depend on exports anymore, but will enlarge its domestic market.
That is why Croatian producers are satisfied with the change," he says.

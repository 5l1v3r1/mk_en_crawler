TIRANA, Albania -- State police are supporting the environment ministry in efforts to deal with sea pollution caused by illegal sewage systems.
Despite peak tourist season, authorities in Durres started to destroy all connections Sunday (August 8th) leading directly into the sea.
Beaches in the Durres area were ranked most polluted in a recent report drafted by the Health Institute and the environment ministry.
The pollution levels are far above World Health Organisation standards.

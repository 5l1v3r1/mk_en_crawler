BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) on Wednesday (March 10th) failed again to remove Mircea Geoana, of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), from his post as Senate speaker.
After a committee vote failed, the PDL tried to add the matter to the plenum's agenda, but the PSD and the National Liberal Party blocked efforts to initiate a no-confidence motion.
The PDL wants Geoana out for allegedly violating Senate rules.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Leaders of the People's Party unanimously decided on Sunday (February 3rd) not to participate in the April 6th presidential election. 
The party decided to leave it up to individual members to decide whom to support.
Meanwhile, Liberal Alliance leader Miodrag Zivkovic warned on Monday that political parties should concentrate on the election rather than speculate about Milo Djukanovic's possible return to the post of prime minister. 
Lung cancer forced Zeljko Sturanovic to resign last week.

TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is at a crucial juncture in its democratic development, according to a report presented last week to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna by the former head of the OSCE mission to Tirana, Ambassador Osmo Lipponen.
The report stressed that the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2005, would serve as a test for the depth of institutional reforms.
Lipponen called on Albanian leaders to demonstrate the political will needed for meeting international standards.

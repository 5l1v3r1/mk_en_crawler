WASHINGTON, United States -- Three ethnic Albanian brothers from Kosovo, a man born in Turkey and a Jordanian national have been arrested in the United States on charges of planning a terrorist attack on the Fort Dix army base in New Jersey. 
One other ethnic Albanian was indicted on a lesser charge. 
Officials say the group, which had been under surveillance for 16 months, had trained in the Pocono Mountains and tried to obtain guns and explosives. 
The FBI recorded conversations between the suspects indicating that they wanted to kill as many US soldiers as possible in defence of Islam. 
The group has no apparent links to al-Qaeda.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener says Turkey expects to receive the first tranche of an $8.5 billion loan from the United States by the end of this month.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul commented Tuesday (21 October) that there are no problems associated with the loan and that the economy does not require it at present.
He added that the loan is in no way related to decisions regarding sending Turkish peacekeeping troops to Iraq.
In other news Tuesday, a Turkish construction firm began technical activities related to clearing landmines in Afghanistan.
The Entes Industry Facilities Production and Assembly Corporation won a tender for the project earlier this year.

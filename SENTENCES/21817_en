ATHENS, Greece -- Two ferries carrying more than 1,500 passengers collided near the port of the island of Andros on Wednesday (July 23rd), injuring three people, the merchant marine ministry said.
The Super Ferry II, travelling from the port of Rafina to the islands of Andros, Tinos and Mykonos, hit the anchored ferry Theologos during docking manoeuvres.
Two men and a woman needed medical treatment.
In other news, authorities evacuated hundreds of local residents and factory workers from homes and businesses Wednesday, as a wildfire approached the northern Athens suburb of Kryoneri.
The fire broke out in the pine forests of Varybobi and spread rapidly, forcing authorities to suspend northbound trains from Athens.
They also closed a section of Greece's main highway.
Another forest fire still rages on the island of Rhodes.
Police arrested two elderly people for unintentional arson, according to local media reports.

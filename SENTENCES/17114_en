ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan appealed to parents on Saturday (1 April) to prevent their children from becoming involved in "terrorist activities", warning that children and women could become victims in clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdish rioters in the country's southeast. 
His statement came as rioting continued in the southeastern region of Diyarbakir for a sixth day Saturday.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government may ban Serbian government delegations "that seek to support Serb parallel structures and agitate Serbs" from entering Kosovo, government spokesperson Memli Krasniqi said on Wednesday (December 24th).
"Kosovo's institutions have ...
the full right to decide whether to allow or not a visit by foreign delegations," Krasniqi said.
The reaction came a few days after a Serbian government delegation visited Gracanica.
The officials helped open a branch of Serbia's Post Telecom and met mayors of Serb municipalities, which Pristina considers parallel structures.
In other news, Kosovo officially opened its embassy in Washington on Tuesday.
The embassy has already started diplomatic correspondence with other countries' embassies in the United States.

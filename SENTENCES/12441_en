BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Court of Auditors presented a report to the European Parliament on Tuesday (11 January) which cite irregularities in the funding of numerous EU projects in the Balkans. 
According to the auditors, one fifth of the contracts signed by the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) in 2003 had "anomalies". 
The EAR, based in Thessaloniki, Greece, has spent 2 billion euros on reconstruction projects in the Balkans since 2000, particularly in Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo.

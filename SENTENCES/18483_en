BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia's reformist parties are again being urged to agree quickly on the formation of a new democratic government. 
On Wednesday (May 9th), the German Presidency of the EU, NATO and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) issued separate statements to that effect.
Parties in Serbia's democratic bloc have spent months trying to strike a deal, but the ante was raised earlier this week when Tomislav Nikolic of the ultranationalist Radical Party was elected parliament speaker with the support of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel phoned Kostunica on Wednesday to voice her concerns over the situation. 
The constitutional deadline to form a government expires on Monday.

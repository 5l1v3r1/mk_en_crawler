BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic said Friday (18 March) that the conditions for BiH's admission to the NATO Partnership for Peace programme, including the key requirement for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, have not been fulfilled yet. 
He added that another key requirement -- completion of state-level defence sector personnel appointments -- is already far along in its implementation. 
Radovanovic signed related legislation early last week.
In separate news, two Bosnian Serbs -- Dragoje Paunovic and Marko Samardzija -- surrendered to local authorities Friday. 
They have been indicted for war crimes by courts in Sarajevo Canton and Bihac Canton, respectively.
Also on Friday, a Bosnian Serb paramilitary leader on trial for rape and torture asked the UN tribunal to give him an extra month to study his indictment. 
Judge Liu Daqun, who presided over the hearing, allowed Gojko Jankovic to not enter a plea and said he would call a new session after 30 days. 
Three other men indicted together with Jankovic were sentenced in 2001 to jail terms of up to 28 years. 
Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte says she wants Jankovic's trial to be held in the newly established war crimes court in BiH.

ATHENS, Greece -- Debates over the European Constitution must not block negotiations on the EU's future expansion, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Thursday (October 19th). 
Negotiations with Croatia and Turkey should proceed despite Europe's attempts to sort out the problems with its constitutional reform, he said.
"We must continue making progress on this area in parallel with the accession process and not hold the Western Balkans and Turkey hostage to our internal debates," Rehn said. 
Croatia could be ready for membership in the EU by the end of the decade, he added.

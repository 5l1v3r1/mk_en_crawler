BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic announced on Wednesday (October 15th) that the prosecution would open criminal proceedings against seven people suspected of helping war crimes indictee Stojan Zupljanin while he was in hiding.
Police finished questioning the seven suspects last week, spokesman Bruno Vekaric said.
They are suspected of providing false IDs to former Bosnian Serb police commander Zupljanin before his arrest in Serbia in June.
While at large, he travelled freely under a false identity to a number of countries.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Local media reports on Tuesday (August 7th) suggest that leaders of the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party will likely choose between Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin and Kostadin Paskalev, former mayor of Blagoevgrad, as the party's candidate for the Sofia mayoral race.
Paskalev appears to be the frontrunner, given his experience in running a city.
Local elections are scheduled for October 28th.
As for the right wing parties, the Union of Democratic Forces appears to back incumbent Mayor Boyko Borisov of GERB for a second term, while the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria will probably nominate their own candidate.
The National Movement for Stability and Progress has not indicated its position yet.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Speaking during a visit Wednesday (27 April) to Sofia, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said his country would ratify Bulgaria's EU Accession Treaty, adding that Bulgaria has nothing to worry about concerning the treaty. 
Addressing claims made by German opposition parties that enlargement would lead to Western European countries being flooded by cheap labour, he assured Bulgaria that the governing coalition supports ratification and that the opposition's objections would not impact the approval process. 
EU countries can take advantage of a transitional period, during which labour flow from the new member states will be restricted, Fischer noted.

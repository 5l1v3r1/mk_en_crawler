ATHENS, Greece -- Greece's Supreme Court confirmed on Tuesday (22 November) a lower court decision to extradite Croatian businessman Hrvoje Petrac, who faces a prison sentence in Croatia for abduction. 
He is also suspected of having links to top Croatian war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina. 
The tycoon was detained in Corfu with forged documents in August after 18 months on the run.

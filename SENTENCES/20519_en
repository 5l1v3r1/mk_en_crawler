NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos said on Friday (February 8th) that if re-elected, he will oppose any effort to revive the UN plan for the island's reunification.
"I want to state clearly that under no circumstances will I accept to bring back the Kofi Annan plan or to review his version under a different name," Papadopoulos told journalists in Nicosia.
During two separate referendums in 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community adopted the Annan plan, while the Greek Cypriots rejected it.
As a result, only the southern part of the island joined the EU.
Papadopoulos faces re-election on February 17th.

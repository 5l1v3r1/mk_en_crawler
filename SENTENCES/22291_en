THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal decided to release former Kosovo Minister of Culture Astrit Haraqija and his associate Bajrush Morina until their trial. 
They face charges of attempting to intimidate witnesses scheduled to testify in the recent trial of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
UNMIK guaranteed the two will return to custody when their trial begins. 
Both pleaded not guilty to charges of contempt in late April. 
If convicted, they face up to seven years in prison, a 100,000-euro fine, or both.
In other news Tuesday (May 13th), authorities found the body of a 40-year-old member of the Kosovo Police Service at a Prizren motel. 
Someone shot her four times in the head, apparently with her own weapon. 
Police arrested a suspect.

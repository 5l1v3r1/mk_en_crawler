BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court accepted on Thursday (January 31st) the argument by former Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu, who says that three articles of a law on which the national body studying the archives of the communist secret police operates are unconstitutional. 
As a result, the panel is expected to be dissolved as soon as the court decision is published in the official gazette. 
The panel says Voiculescu was involved with the Securitate, an accusation he has repeatedly denied.

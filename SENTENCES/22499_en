TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) wants to amend the constitution again soon by lifting immunity for lawmakers. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Saturday (May 10th) that the DP will ask that lawmakers are eligible to be investigated, but would enjoy protection from arrest. 
Continuing constitutional reforms is proof of the vision shared by the opposition and the ruling party regarding Albania's development, Berisha said. 
The DP and the opposition Socialist Party worked together recently to pass long-awaited electoral reforms.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak reiterated on Monday (March 10th) that BiH political leaders must take decisive action to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and to have the Office of the High Representative transformed into the Office of the EU Special Representative.
At a news conference, Lajcak said BiH faces an opportunity it cannot afford to miss.
"If the responsible leaders of this country want to achieve their goals, they will have to work hard;
at the moment all I'm seeing is political hot air aimed at doing everything but finding agreement," Lajcak said.
"The international community is looking for clear evidence that BiH's political leaders are ready and capable of leading this country in a positive direction, towards the EU."
Meanwhile, a meeting of the six ruling coalition leaders scheduled for Monday was postponed because representatives of the Union of Independent Social Democrats and Croatian Democratic Union 1990 were unable to attend.
It is unclear when the meeting will be rescheduled.

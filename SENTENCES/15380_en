TAMPERE, Finland -- Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, whose country currently holds the rotating EU Presidency, announced on Monday (November 27th) that no agreement was reached between the EU and Turkey on the Cyprus issue, despite separate meetings with his Turkish and Cypriot counterparts, Abdullah Gul and George Lillikas, within the framework of a EU-Mediterranean summit in Tampere. 
"Circumstances do not permit the reaching of an agreement during the Finnish Presidency," he said, adding that the EU General Affairs Council, which convenes on December 11th, would decide how this affects Turkey's EU membership talks.
Later on Monday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said negotiations with Turkey would not be suspended, but overall progress would be slowed.

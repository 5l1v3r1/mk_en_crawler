ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic has decided to cut the prison sentences of two ethnic Serbs sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for war crimes. 
On Tuesday (21 June), Mesic announced that the sentences of Damjan Vukmirovic and Slobodan Bosanac -- both convicted in 1995 for crimes committed against civilians on Croatian territory during the war -- would be reduced to 17 and 18 years respectively. 
Earlier this month, Mesic reduced the sentences of other two war criminals -- Stjepan Grandic and Nikola Dragusin.

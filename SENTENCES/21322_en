BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between BiH and the EU is not on the agenda of the two-day EU Foreign Ministers Council meeting that begins on Monday (April 28th) in Luxemburg, says Anze Logar, spokesman for EU's Slovenian presidency.
He said on Friday that the delay was purely technical and stemmed from the translation of documents.
"There are no political barriers to signing the SAA between the EU and BiH," said Logar, adding the ceremony will occur on May 26th.
In other news, the Belgian Foreign Ministry confirmed on Sunday that The Netherlands and Belgium submitted a compromise proposal to the EU regarding the signing of an SAA with Serbia.
Most EU member states believe Serbia should seal the SAA before the May 11th general elections as a gesture of support for pro-democratic forces.
Until now, The Netherlands and Belgium have insisted Serbia should first arrest remaining war crimes fugitives.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government will implement all reforms spelled out in its action plan for EU membership by the end of June, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Monday (March 21st). 
He confirmed that roughly 70% of the measures have already been introduced, though some crucial reforms remain. 
These include a law on the restitution of seized property and a new law on political parties' funding. 
In addition, regulatory bodies must get expanded authority, while personnel changes must be implemented in the public administration. 
Djelic did not specifically rule out the possibility of Serbia failing to receive EU candidate status by the end of the year.

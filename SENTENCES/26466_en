ANKARA, Turkey -- Militants from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) claimed responsibility Thursday (December 10th) for an ambush that killed seven Turkish soldiers and wounded three others earlier this week.
The pro-Kurdish Firat news agency, quoting a PKK statement, reported that a unit attacked the soldiers Monday in the province of Tokat, to avenge army operations against the militants.
The claim comes amid government efforts to give more rights to Turkey's Kurdish minority and as Turkey's Supreme Court deliberates whether to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party for alleged links to the PKK.
Meanwhile, Kurdish rebel supporters clashed with police Thursday in the eastern city of Van, hurling stones, firebombs and fireworks.
Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and detained 25 protesters.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's war crimes court sentenced former Bosnian Serb police officer Dragan Crnogorac on Friday (May 13th) to 13 years in prison for war crimes.
According to the court, Crnogorac was involved in the apprehension and killing of ten Muslims, who tried to escape Srebrenica in 1995.
Crnogorac admitted his involvement in the crimes and pleaded guilty.
The court ruled that he was drawn into the Bosnian Serb army from Serbia against his will and was ordered by superiors to commit the killings against his will.

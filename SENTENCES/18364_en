TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the OSCE/ODIHR observation mission, Jorgen Grunnet, said on Wednesday (February 14th) that he hopes Sunday's local elections in Albania will be held in an atmosphere of political maturity, marked by calm and fairness.
Grunnet, speaking on Albanian Public Television, noted that although the vote was preceded by a political crisis, disputes have been resolved and all parties must accept the election results.
Meanwhile, a new incident marred the final stages of the campaign.
Early Thursday morning, a bomb damaged a restaurant Tirana Mayor Edi Rama had left only minutes before.
He had been attending an associate's birthday party.
There were no injuries.
US Ambassador to Albania Marcie Ries is calling for a full investigation.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The parliamentary committee for human rights and rights of national minorities decided Wednesday (1 December) that the Counterintelligence Agency (POA) violated the human rights of journalist Helena Puljiz. 
In October, POA agents detained and questioned Puljiz for hours over her alleged links to a businessman sought by police. 
The case prompted President Stipe Mesic to authorise the dismissal of POA head Josko Podbevsek. 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has refused to carry out the dismissal, triggering a public rift.

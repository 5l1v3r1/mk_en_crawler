BUCHAREST, Romania -- Frederic Vincent, a spokesman for EU Commissioner for Labour and Social Affairs Vladimir Spidla, says in an interview for Romanian media that the European Commission (EC) does not consider Romanians a threat to the British labour market. 
In the interview with the Bucharest-based NewsIn agency on Tuesday (22 August), Vincent said that the EC has obtained no official information from London about possible restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers. 
He added that Romanians pose no threat to the British or any other EU member state's labour market. 
He also noted that after the accession of the ten newest members in May 2004, the size of the grey economy shrank.

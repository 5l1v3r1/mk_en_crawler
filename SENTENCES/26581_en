ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou on Sunday (January 10th) condemned a bomb attack near the parliament building in downtown Athens. 
"Democracy cannot be terrorised," Papandreou said after visiting the scene. 
Saturday's explosion caused damage but no injuries. 
Shortly before, an anonymous caller phoned the Eleftherotypia newspaper to warn of the bomb, planted in a rubbish bin. 
Citizen's Protection Minister Michalis Chryssohoidis described the attack as a "symbolic act" and vowed to bring its perpetrators to justice.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An EULEX judge in Mitrovica on Friday (June 18th) refused to extradite a Kosovo Albanian terrorism suspect to the United States, and ordered his release due to the lack of sufficient evidence.
"He is not under arrest but he has to show up at the police twice a week," court spokesperson Christina Herodes said.
The suspect, who was arrested by the Kosovo police under the supervision of EULEX and five FBI agents, has been identified by the local press as Bajram Asllani, 29.
He has been charged in the United States with providing support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap and damage property in a foreign country.

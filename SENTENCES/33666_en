PARIS, France -- Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin on Monday (8 September) voiced strong backing for Romania's ambitions to join the EU in 2007, after a meeting with his counterpart from Bucharest, Adrian Nastase. 
The European Commission has signaled that Romania and Bulgaria could join the EU by that date if they complete their accession talks by the end of 2004. 
Nastase met later with French industrial leaders and noted that trade between the two countries exceeded 2 billion euros in 2002.
In other news, Romanian President Ion Iliescu began an official two-day visit to Kazakhstan on Monday. 
The strengthening of business relations is a main goal, as Romania is interested in the possibility of bringing Caspian oil to Central and Western Europe.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet will ask parliament Tuesday (September 15th) for a vote of confidence on three bills -- on a single wage system in the public sector, education reform and public administration reform.
The measures suggest major fiscal consolidation, including wage freezes and job cuts in the public sector, as suggested by the IMF and the European Commission.
The National Liberal Party, the largest opposition party, announced it would boycott the votes of confidence, because none of its amendments were adopted.
Outside the parliament building, as many as 6,000 public servants are expected to protest the measures.
Eleven unions have vowed to launch a general strike against the austerity measures on October 5th.

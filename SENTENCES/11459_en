NEW YORK, United States -- International media said Monday (23 May) that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, in a report to the Security Council to be released later this week, will recommend mid-2005 as the date for launching a review intended to lead to the start of talks on the province's final status. 
The process, according to Annan, should start with the assumption that Kosovo's leaders will continue to move towards meeting a set of internationally established standards of democracy. 
The report is said to warn that the outcome of the talks is "not a foregone conclusion".
In other news Monday, representatives of the Contact Group for Kosovo, which includes the EU, Russia, and the United States, met in London to review the province's progress in the areas of human rights and minority protection. 
The British Foreign Office described the closed-door meeting as a stocktaking session ahead of the upcoming Security Council meeting.
Top Serbian and Serbia-Montenegrin officials are meeting in Belgrade on Tuesday to discuss a draft platform on Kosovo. 
It is to be presented during the Security Council session.

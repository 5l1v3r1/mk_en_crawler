BOCHUM, Germany -- A German national who served with UNMIK was sentenced Monday (16 June) to three and a half years in prison for embezzlement. 
Joe Trutschler, 37, admitted to stealing $4.3m from the Kosovo Electricity Company and depositing the money in private accounts in Gibraltar. 
Initially, he claimed that he had been setting the cash aside to secretly raise the salaries of Kosovo's energy workers.

KAS, Turkey -- The foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece took a highly symbolic walk together in the streets of Kas on Saturday (3 May) to reiterate their governments' desire for peace and co-operation.
Abdullah Gul and George Papandreou said they had decided to submit, jointly to the UN, ratifications of the accords banning the use of landmines on their common border.
The move is designed as a gesture of friendship between the two once bitter rivals.
The two ministers also urged the start of a fresh round of UN-sponsored talks on the future of Cyprus.

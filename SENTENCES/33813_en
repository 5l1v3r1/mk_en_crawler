ZAGREB, Croatia -- Polling stations opened Sunday (23 November) morning for the hotly contested general election. 
Prime Minister Ivica Racan, a Social Democrat, is seeking a fresh four-year mandate for his coalition. 
He faces a strong challenge from the revamped Croatian Democratic Union, which says his economic reforms have caused too much pain. 
Observers doubt one single party will win the majority needed to form a cabinet. 
The election outcome will likely be decided by the smaller parties that would become part of future coalitions. 
All the main parties advocate membership in the EU and NATO.

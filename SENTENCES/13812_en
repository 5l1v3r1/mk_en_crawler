BRUSSELS, Belgium -- At its meeting in Brussels on Monday (20 March), the EU Council expressed its strong support for Serbia's citizens in the quest to "come to terms with the legacy of the Milosevic regime," according to a press release published on the EU Web site.
The ministers stressed that the process would help Serbia move forward on the road to EU integration.
At the same time, the statement reiterated that fulfilling obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal and resolving the cases of fugitives Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic -- among others -- is necessary for negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to proceed.

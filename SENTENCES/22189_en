BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's foreign ministers on Monday (September 15th) called on Romania and Bulgaria to step up their fight against corruption and to produce more convincing results in legal and administrative system work.
The ministers said both countries have to "intensify their efforts ...
especially in the areas highlighted by [the European Commission's] reports".
In its July reports, the EC criticised the two new member states for poor results in fighting corruption and organised crime.
Also Monday, European Commissioner for Multilingualism Leonard Orban said the EC has called on Romania to tighten its fiscal policy and reduce bureaucracy.
He added the government should also lift "administrative burdens" on companies.

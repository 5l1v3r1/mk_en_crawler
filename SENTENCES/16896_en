TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Thursday (4 May) unanimously approved the composition of an ad hoc committee formed to investigate Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku. 
The 11-member panel will have a two-month mandate. 
Astrit Patozi of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) will serve as chairman, while Fatmir Xhafa of the Socialist Party will be his deputy. 
The DP accuses Sollaku of links to organised crime, an allegation which he heatedly denies.

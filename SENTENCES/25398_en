BELGRADE, Serbia -- Labour and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic will establish a new political party next week -- the Social Democratic Party of Serbia.
In an interview with Belgrade-based daily Novosti on Sunday (August 23rd), Ljajic said the new party will work to solve the daily problems confronting ordinary people.
He added that his current party -- the Sandzak Democratic Party -- will continue to function at the local and regional levels and will partner with the new party in the next elections, scheduled for May 2012.
Ljajic, who is also head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, said that arresting fugitive Ratko Mladic remains a government priority.
Operations to track him down continue, Ljajic added, without elaborating.

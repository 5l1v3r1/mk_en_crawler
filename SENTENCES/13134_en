SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The official ceremony transfering the duties of international community High Representative from Britain's Paddy Ashdown to Germany's Christian Schwarz-Schilling will take place in Sarajevo on Tuesday (31 January).
Schwarz-Schilling arrived in the Bosnian capital Sunday.
Speaking to reporters at the airport, he said that he is a friend to BiH and sincerely hoped for co-operation with its politicians.
Ashdown meanwhile announced on Friday that he is allowing some 160 former officials -- formerly banned from public or elected office for obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords -- to participate again in elections.
Ashdown said he based his decision on the country's changed situation.
In other news, the BiH Constitutional Court decided on Saturday it will rule in March about the legality of laws in Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH concerning entity symbols.
BiH presidency member Sulejman Tihic maintains certain texts in the entity legislation regarding coats of arms, anthems and flags fail to comply with the BiH Constitution.

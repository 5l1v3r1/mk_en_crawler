ANKARA, Turkey -- The prosecution pressed charges on Friday (September 25th) against four terror suspects arrested on Wednesday in Athens.
The four were charged with membership in a terrorist organisation, bomb attacks, and possession of explosives.
The indictment lists the bomb attacks on former Public Order Minister Panayotis Hinfotis' home in July, and earlier this week against PASOK party lawmaker Louka Katseli.
According to the prosecution, the suspects are related to the "Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei" extremist group, believed to be responsible for the attacks.
The prosecution issued warrants for the arrest of another six suspected members of the organisation.

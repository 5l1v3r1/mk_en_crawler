SKOPJE, Macedonia -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon replied on Tuesday (August 19th) to a letter from Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski asking that international institutions engage in issues confronting the so-called Macedonian minority in Greece.
In his letter, Ban said he is aware there are probably other issues that belong on the agenda of discussions between Skopje and Athens.
But he said resolution of the name dispute should come first and would pave the way to better relations.
Ban expressed confidence that the UN envoy in the dispute, Matthew Nimetz, would make every effort to find a solution to the dispute, which has dragged on for more than 16 years.

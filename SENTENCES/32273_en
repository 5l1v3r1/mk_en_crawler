BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition and President Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) agreed Tuesday (5 November) to set aside their differences and end the republic's political deadlock. 
The move came after Kostunica's deputies returned to parliament for the first time in five months. 
In a statement signed by the president and Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, DOS and DSS pledged to work together to adopt the constitution of the new Serbia and Montenegro federation. 
Also Tuesday, parliament voted overwhelmingly to remove a provision requiring a 50 per cent turnout for a presidential run-off. 
Under the new law, a candidate will be elected in the first round if he gets more than half the votes. 
Failing that, in the run-off between the two top vote getters, the one who gets more votes will win.

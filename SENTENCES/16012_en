SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups may be trying to recruit Muslims from BiH and the former Yugoslavia, the Associated Press reported on Monday (17 April), citing a 252-page analysis prepared by US and Croatian intelligence. 
It said extremists were using cash from drug smuggling operations and attempting to take advantage of porous borders in order to meet, recruit and train members. 
According to the report, the efforts began four years ago as security measures were tightened in the West, making it more difficult for terrorists to carry out attacks. 
BiH Minister of Security Barisa Colak acknowledged the report but said authorities had no concrete evidence suggesting recruitment efforts are widespread.

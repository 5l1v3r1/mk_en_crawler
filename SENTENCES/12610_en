BUCHAREST, Romania -- A poll conducted by the INSOMAR agency late last month shows sustained support for Romania's ruling coalition. 
The results, presented at the weekend, suggest that if elections were held now, the ruling National Liberal Party and Democratic Party alliance would get 53.5 per cent of the vote. 
The main opposition Social Democratic Party is trailing with 26.4 per cent. 
As many as 34.3 per cent of the respondents said they would not vote or were undecided.

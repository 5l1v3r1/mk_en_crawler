SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) is launching a campaign calling for early elections. 
At a rally in the town of Stip on Sunday (November 21st), SDSM leader Branko Crvenkovski accused the ruling coalition of failing to bring the country closer to NATO and EU membership. 
Wrapping up its two-day summit in Lisbon on Saturday, the Alliance reiterated that Macedonia will be invited to join "as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue [with Greece] has been reached within the framework of the UN". 
Crvenkovski also criticised authorities for the country's economic situation and high unemployment. 
He said the SDSM will file a no-confidence vote against the government after next month's EU summit.

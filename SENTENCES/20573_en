PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegro should follow the lead of EU member states and recognise Kosovo's expected independence in the interest of regional stabilisation, Judy Batt, of the EU Institute of Security Studies, said on Wednesday (January 9th). 
She told the Podgorica-based Vijesti newspaper that Kosovo neighbour Macedonia should do the same, as most EU members are likely to recognise the breakaway province's independence.
In other news Wednesday, a stray bullet hit an airliner as it was landing in Podgorica causing minor damage. 
A spokesman for Montenegro Airlines said workers conducting a post-flight inspection of the Fokker 1000 discovered a bullet hole in a tail stabiliser. 
The shot apparently was fired by revelers celebrating the Orthodox Christmas.

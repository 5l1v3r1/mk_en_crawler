BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana said Monday (16 February) that the Union is "very concerned" about the possibility the new Serbian government would rely on support from Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party.
"We don't think that this decision goes in the right direction.
And I don't think it's going to help very much the political and economic relationship with the international community," he warned.
The tripartite moderate coalition in Serbia does not have enough votes in parliament to secure the election of a cabinet.
In other news Monday, it was announced that dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade would resume in the first week of March.
But Belgrade's Kosovo co-ordinator, Nebojsa Covic, said the agenda remains unclear, as does the composition of the delegations.

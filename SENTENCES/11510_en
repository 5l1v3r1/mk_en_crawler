NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Early parliamentary elections are being held in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sunday (20 February), with an estimated 150,000 Turkish Cypriots expected to vote for a new legislature and government. 
Polls show the race is closely tied between the Republican Turkish Party of outgoing Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat and the National Unity Party of Dervis Eroglu. 
The results are considered significant for reunification talks between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. 
Last year, Talat supported UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's peace plan, while Eroglu rejected it.

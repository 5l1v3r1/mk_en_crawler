BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ethnic Hungarian partner in the Romanian government, UDMR, implied on Tuesday (25 October) that it might withdraw from the coalition cabinet over a draft law on minorities currently being debated in the senate.
The warning, from UDMR's leader Marko Bela, came after the legislature rejected a provision envisioning cultural autonomy for minorities.
UDMR deputies left the session in protest.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following recent allegations about an assassination plot against Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, RS police say they have learned of a similar plot against Banja Luka regional prosecutor Milan Tegeltija.
Speaking on Wednesday (January 3rd), Tegeltija said police had cautioned him that criminal circles in RS and Serbia were planning an attempt on his life.
The threat reportedly is connected to several organised crime, drug and arms trafficking cases Tegeltija has been handling.

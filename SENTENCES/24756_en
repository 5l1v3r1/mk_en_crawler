BELGRADE, Serbia -- Kosovo's transport and telecommunications minister, Fatmir Limaj, is the subject of a probe by Serbian war crimes prosecutors, media in Belgrade reported Sunday (May 3rd). 
The investigation is into Limaj's alleged involvement in crimes against Serb civilians in the Drenica region. 
Limaj has already stood trial at The Hague war crimes tribunal, which acquitted him in 2005.
In Pristina, government officials criticised the Serbian investigation as a "farce". 
Government spokesman Memli Krasniqi said Serbia should "deal with its own criminals and investigate crimes committed in Kosovo during the war, and not deal with absurd things".

TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy UN Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro on Wednesday (September 8th) praised Albania for its economic, social and political progress.
Migiro was in Tirana, where she met with President Bamir Topi and other senior officials to discuss the Millennium Development Goals.
"Development is a key element of peace and security," Migiro stressed on the second day of her visit.
Albania has developed good relations with the UN, she added.
Topi expressed appreciation for the work of the UN especially through its "Delivering as One" initiative, a pilot project that aims to boost the UN's impact through more coherent programmes, reduced transaction costs for governments, and lower overhead costs for the UN system.
Earlier Wednesday, Migiro met with Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli and praised her role in combating violence and boosting the rights of women and children.

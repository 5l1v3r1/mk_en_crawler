According to Culture and Tourism Minister Atilla Koc, Turkey will be visited by nearly 30 million tourists and will earn approximately $18 billion from tourism this year. 
There are signs that a new record will be set this year, in light of figures from the first quarter showing that 2.5 million tourists visited Turkey. 
This represents a 30 per cent increase from the same period last year.
Surrounded by four different seas, Turkey boasts over 8,000km of beaches. 
Besides sun/sea tourism, the country offers visitors a rich cultural heritage spanning 10,000 years and encompassing more than 20 civilisations. 
Much of that heritage is still in the process of being discovered. 
According to the 2004-2005 tourism season report from Europe's largest tourism company, TUI, a boom in demand is occurring in the Turkish tourism sector, and the country stands to attract 15 per cent more tourists this year, compared to 2004. 
Last month, the company predicted that Turkey would be one of the most attractive locations for tourism this year, followed by Portugal, Tunisia and Morocco.
According to the State Institute of Statistics (DSI), the number of tourists entering Turkey has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. 
In 2004, visitors numbered more than 17.5 million -- an increase of approximately 25.7 per cent compared with 2003. 
It would be an understatement to describe last year's figures as robust. 
In fact, they surpassed the World Tourism Organisation's projections for Turkish tourism in 2010.
The DSI's data shows that 75 per cent of tourists are coming from countries within the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development membership, and 27.6 per cent from East European countries. 
In 2004, 22.4 per cent of total tourists visiting Turkey were German, followed by visitors from Russia, Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Iran, France, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Azerbaijan, Italy, Ukraine and the United States.
Tourism revenues are a crucial source of foreign currency for Turkey, as it struggles to curb a swelling current account deficit, which hit $15.9 billion in 2004. 
Foreign visitors spent $12.1 billion and local tourists spent $3.8 billion. 
Tourism revenue worldwide jumped from $523 billion to $575 billion in 2004. 
Turkey ranked eighth in the list of top countries in tourism.
However, revenues are somewhat restricted by the "all-included" system which remains in force in most Turkish hotels, despite controversy and calls for change. 
Under this system, guests are offered breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks as part of their hotel package. 
As a result, many spend little money at outside establishments. 
It's convenient for the visitors but less attractive to local businesses, which miss out on opportunities to capitalise on the growing crowds.

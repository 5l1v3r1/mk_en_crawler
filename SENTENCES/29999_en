ANKARA, Turkey -- Local media reported on Saturday (January 22nd) that at least 12 people are being investigated for human organs trafficking.
Organs reportedly were bought for between 4,700 and 7,000 euros and later resold at double the price.
Removing and transplanting the organs allegedly occurred at private clinics in Ankara, Istanbul and Antalya.
On January 10th, police arrested Turkish doctor Yusuf Sonmez, who is suspected of performing dozens of operations as part of an alleged international human organ trafficking network in Kosovo.
Sonmez, who denies any wrongdoing, had been arrested before for allegedly procuring kidneys from destitute Turks for transplant into mostly foreign patients, at significant profit.

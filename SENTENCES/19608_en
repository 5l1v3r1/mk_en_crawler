BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested two key alleged members of Serbia's Zemun Clan criminal gang, which masterminded the 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Luka Bojovic and Veljko Banovic were apprehended Saturday night (September 22nd) after police received information about their return to Serbia from Italy. 
The two reportedly were hired to kill a prominent member of the business community. 
Police raided five apartments in Belgrade and Novi Sad, seizing large amounts of weapons and false documents. 
One of the men, Bojovic, is a prime suspect in a series of murders in the Netherlands.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Foreign Ministry will soon remove the visa requirements for Albanian citizens, Albanian News reported Friday (23 June). 
Reportedly, the move comes in response to the Albanian government's initiative to remove visas for Macedonian citizens of non-Albanian origin. 
Officials of the two countries are confident that the reciprocal requirement lifting will allow for the free flow of people, especially during the summer tourist season.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic announced on Monday (April 20th) that Croatia has submitted its response to a proposal by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn for resolving the country's border conflict with Slovenia. 
In the past, Zagreb has insisted on consideration of the dispute separate from its EU integration process. 
Rehn's proposal, made late last month, reportedly includes the establishment of an ad hoc arbitration panel that will consist of European Commission representatives, one Croatian and one Slovenian official. 
Croatia's position undergoes discussion on Wednesday, when Rehn meets again with the Croatian and Slovenian foreign ministers.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission said Sunday (26 June) that the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) won just over 30 per cent of the votes cast in Saturday's parliamentary elections. 
With more than 90 per cent of the ballots counted, the current ruling National Movement Simeon II is second with about 20 per cent, followed by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), with 12 per cent -- the party's best performance in its 15-year history. 
Observers were stunned by the showing of a new radical nationalist organisation, Attack, which came in fourth with more than 8 per cent of the vote. 
The United Democratic Forces, a conservative coalition, was fifth with 7.7 per cent, followed by former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov's Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria, with 6.4 per cent. 
The Bulgarian Popular Union, also a conservative alliance, won 5.2 per cent. 
Analysts say the Socialists may find it difficult to form a cabinet as only the MRF has so far signaled that it would join them in a ruling coalition. 
Turnout was estimated at 56 per cent.

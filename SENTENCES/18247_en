SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Facing a rift within his party over the results of a party congress earlier this month, NDSV leader Simeon Saxe-Coburg has backed deputy chairman Milen Velchev.
Most of the party's MPs and two ministers accuse Velchev of manipulating the election results at the party congress ten days ago, which removed Plamen Panayotov from a leadership position.
In a statement Thursday (June 14th), Saxe-Coburg criticised members whose actions have damaged the party's image.
He also expressed optimism that the party would once again become a stable member of the ruling coalition.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase says Romania has to restructure and modernise its domestic oil industry as part of preparations to become a member of NATO. 
Currently, Romania imports over 70 per cent of its oil, mainly from Russia. 
With full alliance membership expected in 2004, Bucharest must reassess its considerable energy dependence on that country, he added. 
Nastase also said he personally would work to speed up implementation of the project to build a pipeline between the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta and Croatia's Adriatic Sea port of Omisalj.

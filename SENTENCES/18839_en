SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's Socialist Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev dismissed two deputy ministers from his coalition cabinet Saturday (May 5th), and ordered Economy and Energy Minister Rumen Ovcharov to take leave in response to a corruption scandal that has emerged over the past two weeks.
The right-wing opposition parties have said that they would initiate a no-confidence motion against Stanishev's cabinet at the Parliament before the upcoming vote for Bulgarian European Parliament members, due on May 20th.

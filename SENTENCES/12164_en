ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the EU on Monday (11 April) for failing to understand his country's domestic problems. 
Erdogan's criticism came during a visit to Norway. 
He said Europe equates the Kurdish population with the PKK-KONGRA-GEL terrorist organisation. 
Describing this as a "major mistake", the prime minister stressed that while Turkey respects minority rights, it would not allow "PKK flags to appear in public".

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Saudi Arabia announced on Monday (April 20th) that it has recognised Kosovo's independence, becoming the second Arab country to do so after the United Arab Emirates.
In response, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic accused Riyadh of failing to respect the International Court of Justice at The Hague.
Late last week, both Serbia and Kosovo filed arguments with the court regarding the legitimacy of Kosovo's independence in a case initiated by Serbia.

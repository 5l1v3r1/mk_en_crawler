BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Smail Cekic, a member of the Republika Srpska (RS) government's Srebrenica Commission, said Monday (29 August) that the panel would likely have the final list of those suspected of involvement in the massacre ready by the end of September. 
Talking to reporters in Banja Luka, Cekic said the commission has identified 12 police stations, linked to the actions of Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica in July 1995.
In other news, Russian Ambassador to BiH Konstantin Shuvalov reiterated on Monday that Russian authorities have no information confirming reports that a high-profile Bosnian Serb fugitive, Dragan Zelenovic, was detained in Russia last week. 
He is wanted for crimes allegedly committed in Foca.
Also Monday, the RS government endorsed and forwarded to parliament two laws crucial to BiH defence sector restructuring. 
The cabinet says the entity parliament is expected to okay the legislation, which would lead to establishment of a single defence and army command in BiH.

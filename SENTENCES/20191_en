ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament and political parties should implement reforms related to Turkey's EU membership bid, President Abdullah Gul said on Wednesday (February 13th) during a visit to the foreign ministry. 
"The policies of certain [EU] member states should not hold us back from continuing the EU work. 
If need be, we will display the will to open and close [negotiation] chapters on our own initiative," Gul said. 
Foreign Minister Ali Babacan concedes there has been a considerable slowdown in government activity concerning accession-related reforms.

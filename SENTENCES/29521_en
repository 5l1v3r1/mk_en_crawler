BANGKOK, Thailand -- Authorities have asked Montenegro to arrest former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who holds a Montenegrin passport, Balkan media reported on Monday (May 31st). 
Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya said that Bangkok is ready to provide Podgorica with evidence against Shinawatra. 
Piromya added that if Montenegro wishes to become part of the EU, it should comply with the bloc's strict rules concerning the rule of law and transparency. 
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said recently that the country had received no Interpol arrest warrant for Shinawatra and noted that the Montenegrin Constitution bars the extradition of its citizens. 
Shinawatra is suspected of involvement in recent anti-government street protests in Bangkok that left more than 80 people dead.

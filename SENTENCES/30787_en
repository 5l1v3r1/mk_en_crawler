PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The population and household census has failed to start in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo. 
Majlinda Sinani-Lulaj, spokesperson for the State Census Commission, said on Monday (April 4th) that efforts are being made to convey the importance of the census to Kosovo north citizens. 
This is the first census in 30 years. 
Belgrade is encouraging the boycott, insisting a credible process can only be led by UN agencies, not by the government in Pristina.

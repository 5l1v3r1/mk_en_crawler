ATHENS, Greece -- Border officials have detained more than 260 illegal immigrants on the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea over the past three days, Greek media reported on Sunday (August 17th).
Authorities have been working harder to stop the influx of refugees into the country.
Italy has provided a vessel to help them in this endeavour as part of a European programme for co-operation.
A temporary centre for illegal immigrants established on Samos currently houses about 380 refugees.

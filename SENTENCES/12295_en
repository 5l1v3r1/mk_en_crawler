BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Following a series of recent surrenders, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic told the UN war crimes tribunal Thursday (10 March) that the government has called on all indicted suspects to surrender.
If they fail to do so, he said, all will be found and extradited.
Stojkovic also gave the tribunal guarantees for the release on bail of former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, former Yugoslav Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and former Yugoslav Army chief of staff Dragoljub Ojdanic.
Meanwhile, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the policy of putting political conditions on EU entry is working well.
"This policy gives results in that an average of one indictee per week has surrendered to The Hague tribunal in the past two months, more or less voluntarily," he noted.

NEW YORK, United States -- Turkey became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2009-2010 term on Friday (October 17th), along with Austria, Japan, Uganda and Mexico.
Turkey received two-thirds of the votes and secured a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council's Western European and Others Group.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attributed Turkey's success to its fast-growing influence on international politics.
Foreign Minister Ali Babacan called the country's election "historic".
In other news, police detained dozens of pro-Kurdish demonstrators in two Turkish cities on Saturday following violent clashes.
Demonstrations in support of the imprisoned leader of the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, occurred in the southeastern towns of Diyarbakir and Yuksekova following allegations of his mistreatment in prison.
Meanwhile Friday, the Turkish General Staff said Turkish warplanes hit PKK targets in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq.
Unnamed military sources told Reuters the bombings killed four PKK militants and wounded several others.

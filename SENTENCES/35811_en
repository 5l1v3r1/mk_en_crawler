SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH rejected appeals Wednesday (28 January) by the former Croat member of the BiH presidency Ante Jelavic, former Defence Minister of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Miroslav Prce and former manager of Herzegovina Insurance Miroslav Rupcic, and confirmed they would remain in custody for 30 days.
The three were arrested last week on charges of abuse of office and misappropriation.
Also Wednesday, the FBiH House of Peoples agreed to form a commission to investigate the circumstances of Jelavic and Prce's arrest.
At issue is whether their human rights were violated.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Saturday (April 11th) he expects Croatia to join the EU by 2011. 
In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Sanader predicted that Zagreb will wrap up its accession talks this year, as he expects neighbouring Slovenia to use its EU member status to support Croatia in its bid. 
Ljubljana has instead recently blocked Croatia's talks over the two countries' long-standing border dispute.

PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- By wide margins, parliament voted Wednesday (29 January) to adopt the new constitution of the future union with Serbia and an accompanying implementation law. 
Before the vote, Deputy Prime Minister Dragan Djurovic told lawmakers the new law would grant Montenegro equal status in the new alliance. 
Parliament Speaker Filip Vujanovic later applauded the adoption of the documents, saying they pave the way to setting up the new joint state. 
He noted that the charter allows Montenegro to call an independence referendum three years after the federation is established.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Justice Minister Snezana Malovic said on Sunday (June 20th) that Serbia and Croatia will sign an extradition agreement later this month, covering those who are apprehended on charges of corruption and organised crime.
She added that afterwards, Serbia will request the extradition of Sretko Kalinic, a member of the Zemun Clan crime gang, who was arrested in Croatia earlier this month after being shot by a fellow gang member.
In 2007, Kalinic was sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison for the murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

STRASBOURG, France -- Members of the European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee approved on Thursday (February 10th) the 2010 progress reports for Turkey, Montenegro and Macedonia.
On Turkey, committee members welcomed constitutional amendments enacted after a referendum in 2010, but at the same time stressed the need for an overall reforming of the constitution. 
Slowing Ankara's road to accession are the level of press freedom, women's rights, protection of religious minorities and Cyprus.
For Montenegro, the EP committee members welcomed the decision to grant the country EU candidate status and said accession talks will start after the European Commission's (EC) next progress report, expected in October. 
At the same time, they expressed concern about corruption, organised crime, and media freedom.
Committee members expressed concern about insufficient political dialogue in Macedonia, judicial independence and media freedom. 
Still, according to Zoran Taller, author of the report on Macedonia, the country has long fulfilled the political criteria to start accession talks.

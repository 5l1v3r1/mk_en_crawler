SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Simeon Saxe-Coburg, leader of the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV), expelled four party members with seats in parliament Tuesday (November 27th) -- Plamen Panayotov, Vladimir Donchev, Borislav Velikov and Borislav Ralchev. 
A fifth, Atanas Shterev, decided to leave on his own accord Tuesday, as did Nikolay Svinarov and Vanya Tsvetkova on Wednesday. 
All are members of a faction within the NDSV that opposes some of Saxe-Coburg's decisions. 
The changes leave the party with 45 seats in parliament.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, warned on Sunday (May 15th) that a negative report by chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz could affect Serbia's chances for EU candidate status. 
In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Press, Ljajic said that authorities are searching intensively for the two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, but the tribunal will not be satisfied with these efforts. 
He also said that a survey conducted earlier this month found that 51% of Serbs oppose Mladic's transfer to The Hague, while only 34% support his arrest.

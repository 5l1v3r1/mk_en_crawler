ATHENS, Greece -- University students blocked the main streets in the capital Tuesday (31 May), in protest of a bill introducing a new system to evaluate higher education institutions, in line with EU requirements. 
The draft was approved by the Greek government Monday and sent to parliament. 
Organisers plan to continue rallies Wednesday in other large cities.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Party, said on Friday (June 20th) that late former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ordered his murder in 1999. 
In October of that year, Draskovic's motorcade was hit by a truck on the Ibarska Highway, injuring him and killing four associates. 
Draskovic led the Serb opposition against Milosevic at that time. 
On Thursday, the Supreme Court sentenced 12 people to a total of 257 years in prison for the incident. 
Draskovic told the court he had no doubt Milosevic organised the assassination attempt.

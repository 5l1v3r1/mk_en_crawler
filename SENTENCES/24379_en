BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said on Monday (January 12th) that he has no plans for changes in the government. 
He faced questions on that issue, following President Boris Tadic's recent comment that no one in the government is safe. 
Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic, leader of G17 Plus, also assured recently that the coalition is stable.

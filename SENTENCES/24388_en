SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government informed the European Commission (EC) on Monday (January 12th) that it will reopen the third unit of the Kozloduy nuclear plant, should the country's power system experience serious shortages.
The unit is among four that Bulgaria must decommission in line with its EU Accession Treaty.
However, the Treaty itself reads that Bulgaria could use additional capacities if its power system is under serious threat.
Meanwhile, Russia resumed desperately needed gas deliveries to Europe through Ukraine on Tuesday.
EU officials say it will take at least one day for supplies to reach their final destinations.

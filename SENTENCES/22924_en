SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of Bosnian Serbs gathered in the Jasenovac concentration camp on Sunday (May 4th) to commemorate tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Roma who were murdered there during the pro-Nazi regime in World War II.
The ceremony took place in Donja Gradina, northern BiH, which was previously part of the camp.
The group also commemorated the 63rd anniversary of an unsuccessful attempt by 600 prisoners of war to run away from the centre.
Only 90 of them survived.
Orthodox priests and a representative of the Roma community said prayers to commemorate the victims.
"It is our holy duty to never forget the victims of Jasenovac," Republika Srpska President Rajko Kuzmanovic said at the ceremony.

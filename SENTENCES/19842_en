SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia will not make any concessions in its constitutional name dispute with Greece, President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and the Macedonian envoy in the talks with Athens, Nikola Dimitrov, concluded after a one-hour meeting in the president's cabinet on Saturday (January 19th). 
The government stands firmly behind its position that the name dispute with Greece is a bilateral issue, and says the only possible solution to the crisis would be the implementation of the double formula -- the use of Macedonia's constitutional name internationally and the finding of a mutually acceptable name in communications with Greece. 
The meeting took place ahead of the arrival of UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz, who is coming to Skopje on Monday for talks between the two sides in the conflict.

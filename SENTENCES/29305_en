ATHENS, Greece -- The finance ministry on Monday (October 4th) announced the country's draft 2011 budget, envisioning plans to cut the deficit by 7% of GDP next year.
Previous forecasts -- hammered out with the EU and IMF in May, when the country received a 110 billion-euro bailout package -- were for a budget deficit of 7.6% of GDP in 2011.
"Our aim is to exit the tunnel as soon as possible, so we can support as soon as possible the most vulnerable members of our society," Prime Minister George Papandreou told a government meeting on the draft budget.
The document envisions continuing austerity cuts and more efforts to collect tax revenues.

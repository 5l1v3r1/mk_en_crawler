THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who boycotted the start of his trial at the UN war crimes tribunal, will not appear in court Tuesday (October 27th) either, according to one of his legal advisers, Marko Sladojevic.
The trial was adjourned on Monday because Karadzic failed to show up in the courtroom.
The proceedings will resume Tuesday with the prosecution's opening statement.
Last week, Karadzic announced he was not ready with his defence.
He faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
War crimes victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina reacted bitterly to news of Monday's postponement, saying that by failing to appear in court, Karadzic is stalling and trying to present himself as a martyr.

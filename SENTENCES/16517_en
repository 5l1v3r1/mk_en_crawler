BELGRADE, Serbia -- A new poll by the Faktor Plus agency suggests that most Serbs want Kosovo to remain part of Serbia, but are pessimistic about the likelihood of that happening. 
According to results published on Saturday (9 September), 65.3 per cent of respondents support keeping Kosovo within Serbia's borders, 22.7 per cent back partition of the province, and 12 per cent voiced support for an independent Kosovo. 
Only 23.3 per cent, however, believed that Kosovo would in fact remain within Serbia, while almost half -- 46.5 per cent -- viewed independence as a more likely scenario.
On Monday, the Contact Group for Kosovo was due to begin a two-day meeting in Sofia to discuss the province's future. 
Discussions are focusing on the results so far of the direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina, as well as on steps that must be taken in the months ahead.

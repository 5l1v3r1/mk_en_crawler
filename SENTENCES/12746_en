BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian prosecutors have called on police to confirm the validity of claims made by former Djindjic adviser Vladimir Popovic, according to B92 Radio Thursday (3 February).
Earlier this week, Popovic asserted that the military was involved in the March 2003 murder of the prime minister.
"One of the reasons Zoran Djindjic was killed was that he was due to take over control of the army and the military security service five days later," said Popovic.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The main Croat party HDZ BiH submitted its platform Tuesday (January 25th) for the formation of a new majority in BiH's state-level parliament and a new Council of Ministers. 
The document is based on six main points and contains clear deadlines for when key reform-minded tasks should be implemented. 
The main issue is amending the constitution and implementing a December 2009 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights regarding BiH's election law by late June. 
BiH held elections on October 3rd, but despite intense talks, politicians have failed to agree on forming new entity and state-level governing coalitions.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government and teachers' unions again failed to reach an agreement during weekend negotiations aimed at ending a strike that has closed schools for two weeks, local media reported on Monday (October 8th).
This time, the cabinet offered to cut teacher personnel by 25%, in order to guarantee the remaining teachers a raise of 32.25% next year, up from the last offer of 25%.
The teachers are demanding a 100% raise.
Their unions rejected personnel cuts, though they indicated they might drop demands for a hike in education spending.

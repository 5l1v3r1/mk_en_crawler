ANKARA, Turkey -- The army announced on Thursday (September 18th) the arrests of five lieutenants and a cadet, the first active military officers reportedly involved in the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon, which faces charges of planning a coup d'etat.
Authorities have detained 90 people so far.
They also rounded up on Thursday actress Nurseli Idiz and talent agent Seyhan Soylu.
The Ergenekon case began after police discovered a stash of hand grenades in June 2007 in an Istanbul house owned by a retired noncommissioned officer.
The grenades matched those used in attacks against the Istanbul offices of the Cumhuriyet daily newspaper in 2006.

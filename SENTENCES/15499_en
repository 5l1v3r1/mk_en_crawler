SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Employees of the state-run Macedonian Radio Television, who have been staging a symbolic strike for several weeks over salaries delayed since April, threatened on Wednesday (23 August) to effectively suspend programming until they get their money.
The employees say management offered them a deal earlier this week, under which they would be paid two of the outstanding monthly salaries by 15 September, with the remainder to follow.
The workers rejected that, insisting on immediate payment of all wages.

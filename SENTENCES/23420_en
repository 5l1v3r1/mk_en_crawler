TIRANA, Albania -- Religious communities in Albania reacted harshly on Thursday (July 30th) to the proposed legalisation of gay marriage, branding it as unacceptable and harmful to society. 
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced that the government is considering the measure. 
"Marriage brings together two people of different gender, and it is not acceptable to happen between people of the same sex," said Monsignor George Frendo. 
He warned that if such a law is adopted, the family will be at risk, since in the future, gay couples will want to adopt children. 
The initiative has also been condemned by the Muslim community, which describes it as a sin in which parliamentary members should not participate.
In other news Thursday, public health officials reported at least 13 people are infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus and many others likely have it but are not being treated. 
The Public Health Institute says a total of 239 samples are being analysed to determine if they are cases of swine flu.

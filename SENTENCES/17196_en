BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak caucus in the Republika Srpska (RS) Council of Peoples (CoP) vetoed on Monday (31 July) the entity law on higher education, which was recently passed by the RS Parliament. 
Caucus chief Ramiz Salkic said the measure does not guarantee equality of all constituent peoples in the management of state-run faculties in RS.
Also Monday, the CoP failed to agree on a new RS bill on local self-government and on the amended law on the RS attorney general. 
Both of these were approved by parliament earlier this month. 
Following the three vetoes, the joint commission of the CoP and the RS legislature must now tackle the bills.

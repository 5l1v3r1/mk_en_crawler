SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A court sentenced two former Foca camp officials to prison on Thursday (February 28th) for mistreating and torturing an estimated 700 prisoners, between 1992 and 1994.
Mitar Rasevic received eight and a half years and Savo Todovic was sentenced to 12 years for war crimes committed at the correctional facility.
Time already spent in custody will substantially reduce their sentences.
In other news Thursday, Serge Brammertz, the new chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, met with Croatian Justice Minister Ana Lovrin in Zagreb.

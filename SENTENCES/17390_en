PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- A UN Security Council delegation, led by Belgian UN Ambassador Johan C. Verbeke, travels on Tuesday (April 24th) to Kosovo for a six-day fact-finding trip.
According to a UN press release, the visit "is designed to give Council members a first-hand understanding of the political, social and economic situation inside Kosovo".
Officials in Belgrade and Pristina offered different interpretations of the mission's significance.
Speaking on Monday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said it marks a "completely new phase" in the process of resolving Kosovo's status, adding that the status plan put forward by UN special envoy Martti Ahtissari has failed.
According to Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku, however, it presents a unique opportunity to put an end to all doubts UN member states might have about the current situation in Kosovo.

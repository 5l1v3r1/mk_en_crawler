SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin said late on Monday (June 11th) that his country would seek discussions within NATO about the need to provide equal security for all Alliance members. 
Speaking to Bulgarian National Television after US President George W. 
Bush's daylong visit to Sofia, Kalfin said Bulgaria remains concerned that the country would not be covered under the US's proposed long-range missile shield, an initiative which nearby Russia strongly opposes. 
The shield would only protect Bulgarian airspace from mid-range missiles.

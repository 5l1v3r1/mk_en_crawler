NIS, Yugoslavia -- A Yugoslav military court on Friday (11 October) sentenced four men to prison terms for murdering two ethnic Albanians in April 1999. 
Lt Col Zlatan Mancic and Capt Rade Radivojevic received sentences of seven and five years, respectively, for ordering the execution. 
Danilo Tesic and Misel Seregij, rank-and-file conscripted soldiers at the time, were given four and three years for carrying out the actual shooting. 
The two men admitted killing the Albanians because they feared that they would be executed if they disobeyed the order.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A petition against the trial of Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement leader Albin Kurti will be sent to the UN, the EU and to the Council of Europe. 
The council opposing the trial announced on Sunday (April 11th) that the petition has attracted 175,000 signatures in Kosovo, Albania, Presevo Valley, Macedonia and Montenegro. 
Vetevendosje considers the trial politically motivated and objects to the presence of EULEX judges in the panel. 
The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. 
Kurti faces charges stemming from a protest in February 2007 that turned violent, leaving two protestors dead and dozens injured.

ATHENS, Greece -- Teams from Greece and Serbia-Montenegro got off to shaky starts in the Olympic soccer tournament that opened Wednesday (11 August). 
Greece's men's team was trailing South Korea in the 64th minute before Ioannis Taralidis and Dimitrios Papadopoulos evened the score. 
The Greek women's team lost to the United States 0-3. 
Highly-favoured Argentina, meanwhile, beat Serbia-Montenegro 6-0.
Also on Wednesday, the Olympic flame came home to the greater Athens area after a journey through 26 countries. 
Thousands of people lined roads to watch the flame's final two-day passage from the ancient city of Marathon to downtown Athens. 
One of the torchbearers was 89-year-old Petros Apostolopoulos, who participated in the 1936 torch relay for the Berlin Olympics.
In Belgrade, meanwhile, the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament failed Wednesday to agree on a new national anthem. 
That means Olympic medallists from Serbia-Montenegro will be serenaded with the old national anthem of Yugoslavia. 
Lawmakers from Montenegro opposed the new version, a combination of the Montenegrin anthem and the one Serbia used before World War II.

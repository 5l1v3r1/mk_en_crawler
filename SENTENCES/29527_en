ATHENS, Greece -- The Communist Party-affiliated PAME labour union is organising a rally Tuesday (June 1st) in Athens to protest the government's austerity measures.
The two largest labour unions, the GSEE and the ADEDY, are planning a rally on Saturday.
On Monday, hundreds rallied in Athens and Thessaloniki to protest the Israeli raid on ships carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza.
The protest, outside of Israel's embassy in the capital, led to clashes with police.
Protestors tried to approach the building throwing rocks and setting dustbins on fire, prompting police to fire teargas at them.
A similar rally was held near the Israeli Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus.

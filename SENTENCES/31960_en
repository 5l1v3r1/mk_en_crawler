THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Claude Jorda, president of the UN war crimes tribunal, submitted a letter Wednesday (23 October) to the UN Security Council urging it to press Belgrade into co-operating with the court. 
Jorda said that Yugoslav authorities have not carried out 11 warrants for the arrest of war crime suspects, including Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic conceded "co-operation is far from ideal," but said it was wrong to assume his country was not co-operating.
In other news, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte traveled to Zagreb Wednesday to discuss the case against Gen Janko Bobetko. 
The government has asked that he face charges via a video-link from Zagreb, due to serious health problems.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO-led troops injured a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect in a shootout Tuesday (19 October) after he resisted arrest and opened fire on them, SFOR said.
The Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency identified the man as Nedjo Samardzic, 40.
He is said to have been a wartime member of the Bosnian Serb military in the town of Foca.
The force was notorious for the widespread killing, rape, and expulsion of Muslims.

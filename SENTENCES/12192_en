LUXEMBOURG -- The EU would find it difficult to launch accession talks with Croatia if Zagreb does not arrest and extradite fugitive General Ante Gotovina, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said after a meeting with UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Friday (11 February).
Officials say negotiations will open immediately if the general arrives in The Hague by 17 March, the date set by EU leaders to start Croatia's accession process.
"The Croatian authorities [should] prove that they have co-operated in the full and entire way with the tribunal," Juncker, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said he was not surprised by the statements and repeated that Zagreb is doing everything possible to locate Gotovina.

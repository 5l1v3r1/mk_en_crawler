SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev has requested legislative amendments regarding abductions, Interior Minister Mihail Mikov announced on Monday (April 20th) after an emergency meeting between Stanishev and ministry officials. 
The move came amid a recent surge in kidnappings, the latest case involving an influential businessman whose family paid a large ransom. 
Mikov explained on Monday that the proposed changes include amendments to the Penalty Code that would cover preparations for abductions and accomplices. 
Another measure is eliminating the so-called anonymous SIM cards that abductors use to contact and blackmail victims' families.

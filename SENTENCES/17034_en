TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament decided on Tuesday (2 May) to establish an ad hoc committee that would investigate Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, accused by the ruling Democratic Party (DP) of links to organised crime.
Following heated debate, the ruling coalition managed to ensure enough votes to support the initiative.
Opposition parties accuse the government of undermining independent institutions.
Sollaku sent an open letter to parliament Tuesday, again denouncing the DP's campaign against him and describing the accusations as "ridiculous" and "baseless".

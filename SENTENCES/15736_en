SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Incumbent Socialist-backed President Georgi Parvanov and the leader of the ultranationalist Attack coalition, Volen Siderov, will participate in a run-off next Sunday, as turnout was less than the required 50% in the first round Sunday (October 22nd). 
In all, 64%of those who did turn out backed Parvanov, compared to 22% for Siderov. 
The right-wing bloc's nominee, Nedelcho Beronov, got just under 10%, while the other four candidates split the rest. 
If he wins Sunday as expected, Parvanov would be the first Bulgarian president in history to be re-elected.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski told parliament on Thursday (December 18th) that the past year has been a disappointment.
In his traditional annual address to parliament, Crvenkovski criticised the government's foreign policy, saying the lawsuit Macedonia initiated against Greece at the International Court of Justice is opening many questions for Macedonia and will not speed up talks aimed at resolving the long-standing name dispute between the two countries.
He also slammed the government's economic policy, describing the package of measures that the government proposed to cope with the global financial crisis as insufficient.
He urged the government to spend less and review its "record budget for next year".
Finally, he bemoaned Macedonia's failure to receive an invitation to join NATO last April and the European Commission's refusal to indicate a launch date for EU membership talks.

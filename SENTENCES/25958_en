ATHENS, Greece -- Police used tear gas and arrested over 200 people in clashes that broke out Tuesday (November 17th) during a protest marking the 1973 student revolt against the junta in Athens.
Three police officers were injured during the protest, which attracted tens of thousands of people who gathered in the centre of Athens chanting slogans against capitalism and NATO and in support of emigrants.
Around 6,500 police officers were deployed to handle security during the annual march to the US Embassy, which has often been marred by clashes between anarchists and riot police.

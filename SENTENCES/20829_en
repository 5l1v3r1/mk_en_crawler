ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir handed down five life sentences Thursday (December 6th) to Ayden Tutak, a member of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), for bombing a police car in Batman province last year. 
Four policemen were killed and six were wounded in the attack. 
Tutak was arrested two months ago in Istanbul.
In other news Thursday, CNN Turk reports that thousands of Turkish military commandos have joined a wide-scale search for PKK rebels along the entire 280km border with northern Iraq. 
Reportedly, dozens of tanks and helicopters are involved, as well. 
An estimated 300 PKK guerrillas may have entered Turkey from northern Iraq recently.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 34,000 public servants will walk off their jobs on September 27th for an indefinite amount of time, trade union leader Sebastian Oprescu told a press conference Tuesday (September 14th), insisting that lower-profile protests against massive lay-offs in the public sector and the 25% wage cuts are pointless. 
He added that should other unions would join the initiative, the strike could start earlier, on September 22nd, when large street protests are already scheduled. 
Organisers estimate over 350 public institutions could be significantly affected.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Dick Marty, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) rapporteur who recently wrote a report on alleged illegal CIA detentions in Romania and Poland, came under fire by members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on Tuesday (July 17th). 
During a special meeting with Marty in Brussels, the MEPs criticised him for accusing two EP deputies in relation to the case without identifying his sources.
Marty's report, released last month, concludes the CIA had secret detention centres in 14 European countries from 2003 to 2005, under a secret deal. 
It claimed that former Romanian Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu and former Polish Defence Minister Marek Siwiec covered up CIA activities in their countries. 
Both have dismissed the accusations and say they are suing Marty over them.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown issued a statement Thursday (13 May), urging several cantons -- 2, 6, 7 and 8 -- to bring their primary and secondary education laws in line with the state framework law, warning that otherwise the cantons would face sanctions. 
Expressing disappointment that obstruction of the BiH educational reform by some political powers resulted in the loss of $12m in assistance from the World Bank, Ashdown said that the international community would not tolerate further impediments.

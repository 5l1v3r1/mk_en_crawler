TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Prime Minister Gazmend Oketa called a news conference Sunday (October 21st) to unveil a new project dubbed National Strategy for Development and Integration 2007-2013. 
It includes the obligations stemming from the national plan to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and the plan for NATO integration. 
Oketa said this project replaces the National Strategy for Economic and Social Development approved in 2001 and incorporates 20 sector-based strategies prepared by various government ministries.
On Friday, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer urged Tirana to accelerate efforts to reform its judiciary and political system if it wants an invitation to join the Alliance. 
"The invitation tickets are not punched yet; further reform is necessary," he said.

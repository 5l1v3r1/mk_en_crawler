BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia's bid for membership in the EU and the planned launch of accession talks on 17 March will be discussed during Thursday's (10 March) meeting of the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER). 
According to a statement from the European Commission (EC), cited by the EU Observer on Monday, COREPER is expected to draft possible conclusions ahead of the EU Council's summit on 16 March. 
An EC spokesperson confirmed that the start of membership negotiations with Zagreb is in doubt because of the government's failure to arrest and extradite retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's most wanted indictees. 
On Monday, UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte again criticised Croatia for not handing him over.

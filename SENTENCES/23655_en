BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of ethnic Albanians protested in the town of Bujanovac, near the border with Kosovo, on Monday (January 26th) demanding the release of ten former guerrilla fighters. 
Police arrested them last month in connection with war crimes committed against hundreds of ethnic Serbs towards the end of 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. 
The town, better known as the Presevo Valley, has a predominantly ethnic Albanian population and was the scene of armed clashes between Serbian forces and Albanian separatists in 2001. 
Protesters also demanded that Serb prosecutors investigate war crimes committed against Albanians in the region.
In other news Monday, Serbia extradited a suspected war criminal accused of killing civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Police had arrested Bosnian Serb Blagoje Golubovic in Belgrade after he fled Sarajevo last year in an effort to avoid prosecution. 
He allegedly killed two Muslims in a village near Foca in 1992.
Separately Monday, former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, 79, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence in Sweden for war crimes, retracted her confessions in an interview with a Swedish magazine. 
According to the article, which appears in the February 2nd edition of Vi magazine, Plavsic confessed to war crimes to be able to "bargain" on other charges. 
"I sacrificed myself," Plavsic said.

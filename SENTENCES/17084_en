SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The United States will pull out the last of its troops from BiH by December but that does not mean that its presence there will weaken, US Ambassador Douglas McElhaney said in an interview Wednesday (November 1st). 
The withdrawal of the US soldiers should be seen as a positive sign, he explained, because it demonstrates that the situation has improved so much that s military presence is no longer needed. 
The United States will, however, keep a number of officers in the NATO staff in BiH.
Also Wednesday, BiH's chief negotiator with the EU, Igor Davidovic, and the head of the BiH directorate for EU integration, Osman Topcagic, met in Washington with US Deputy Assistant Secretary Rosemary DiCarlo. 
She stressed the importance of fulfilling reform requirements set by the EU -- particularly police reform.
Outgoing BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic struck the same theme Wednesday, noting that BiH could not seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU without police reform.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government survived its first no-confidence vote Friday (October 8th).
The motion was initiated by the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, who said the government failed to reform the health care sector.
The vote was 144-70, with one abstention.
Meanwhile, about 10,000 workers gathered in Sofia on Thursday to protest government plans to raise the retirement age for both men and women to 65.
Until now, it has been 60 for women and 63 for men.
Trade unions said they will continue their protests until an agreement is reached.
A similar rally was held in neighbouring Macedonia Thursday, where about 2,000 uniformed police officers gathered in Skopje to protest changes in their retirement age.
They demonstrated outside of the Constitutional Court.

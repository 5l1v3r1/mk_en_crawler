STRASBOURG, France -- Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski told the European Parliament on Tuesday (8 April) that the western Balkans should not be left out of the process of European integration. 
He also backed a proposal by Greece, holder of the rotating EU presidency, to make pre-accession funds available to countries in that part of the peninsula. 
Trajkovski said his country should not be treated as a humanitarian case because it is ready to develop joint projects with the Union and to supplement money from the pre-accession funds with its own financing.
In Skopje meanwhile, the government announced Tuesday that a 30-member contingent and a medical team would be sent to Kuwait and Qatar at the end of May to assist with post-war Iraq.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Justice Ministry organised a seminar on human trafficking Thursday (23 January) with the support of the US and Canadian embassies, the Croatian Bar Association, and the ROSA Centre for Women. 
Justice Minister Ingrid Anticevic-Marinovic, judges and prosecutors recommended changes in the penal code in a bid to improve the state's capacity to fight human trafficking. 
Government officials warned that Croatia was moving from being a transit country in the cross-border channels towards becoming a country of origin or final destination for victims.

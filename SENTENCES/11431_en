SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new VMRO-National party, headed by former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, became the biggest opposition group in parliament following a reorganisation of the opposition bloc Tuesday (25 January). 
In all, 12 deputies from VMRO-DPMNE, currently led by Nikola Gruevski, left the party to join Georgievski. 
Five other members of VMRO-DPMNE left, declaring themselves independent. 
The break-up came just weeks ahead of the 13 March local elections.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot government lodged an official complaint Tuesday (26 August) concerning the refusal of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to permit the establishment of a Greek-language high school on the Turkish part of the island. 
The complaint was submitted to relevant authorities in the UN, EU and the United States. 
Greek Cypriot Presidential Commissioner Polakis Sarris says the Turkish side has not given any explanation for its refusal. 
Unless such a school is established, Greek Cypriot children whose families reside on the Turkish part of the island would have to leave their families earlier than usual to attend high school.

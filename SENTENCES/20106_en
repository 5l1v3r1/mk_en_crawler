BELGRADE, Serbia -- Sasa Karadzic, son of the wartime Republika Srpska leader Radovan Karadzic, has been banned from entering Serbia for a year and ordered to pay a fine of 375 euros, the head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Saturday (September 15th).
Sasa Karadzic was taken in for questioning on Friday.
Police then discovered he was using false documents identifying him as a Serbian citizen.
In other news, a recording posted on YouTube apparently contradicts a Bosnian Muslim general's testimony that he had no authority over Islamic fighters who committed atrocities against Croats and Serbs during the 1992-1995 conflict.
In the recording, General Rasim Delic allegedly addresses mujahideen fighters shortly before their departure in late 1995 or early 1996.
"I have never concealed that this unit exists, that this is a unit of the Bosnian army, that it is incorporated in the Bosnian army control and command chain", the voice in the recording says.
If genuine, it could be interpreted as a direct admission that Islamic fighters served as a Bosnian Muslim army unit.

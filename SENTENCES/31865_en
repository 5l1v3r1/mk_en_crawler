THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Two Bosnian Croats were sentenced on Monday (31 March) for war crimes committed during a campaign to rid Mostar of its Muslim population in 1993. 
Mladen Naletilic and Vinko Martinovic were found guilty of several counts of murder, persecution, torture and forced labor. 
Naletilic, 56, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Martinovic, 39, was sentenced to 18 years. 
Troops under their control rounded up Muslims in Mostar and took them to a prison camp where most of the atrocities occurred.

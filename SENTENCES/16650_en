PODGORICA, Montenegro--Visiting British Minister for Europe Geoff Hoon on Wednesday (November 8th) hailed the peaceful and democratic way in which Montenegro gained its independence.
He promised continued British support for the country's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
Following talks with President Filip Vujanovic and outgoing Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, Hoon announced plans to open a British embassy in Podgorica.
Later on Wednesday, he visited Macedonia, the last stop in his regional tour.
After a meeting with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, Hoon reiterated that Great Britain wants to see Macedonia in the EU.
He stressed, however, that the country's entry into the bloc depends on the pace of reforms.

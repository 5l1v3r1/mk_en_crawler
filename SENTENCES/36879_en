BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) adopted a package of measures Wednesday (7 July) aimed at boosting economic development in the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC).
The main objective is to end the area's economic isolation.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen stressed, however, that this does not mean the EU recognises the TRNC.
In other news, NTV is reporting that the TRNC Parliament decided on Thursday to schedule early parliamentary elections.
The tentative date is 26 September.
The move was prompted by the resignations of three lawmakers, which resulted in the ruling coalition losing its majority.

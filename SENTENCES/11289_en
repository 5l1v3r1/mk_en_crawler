ANKARA, Turkey -- Murat Mercan, the deputy head of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said Thursday (24 March) that the government would likely approve a US request to use a Turkish airbase.
Washington has asked Turkey to use the Incirlik airbase as a logistics centre.
Mercan has just returned from the United States, while Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is to travel there in May.
Also Thursday, the Turkish Supreme Court adjourned the trial against former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
It will resume on 15 April.
Yilmaz and former Economy Minister Gunes Taner are accused of arranging the privatisation sale of Turkbank in 1998 on behalf of a particular bidder.
The sale failed, but prosecutors say Yilmaz worked to scare off other bidders.

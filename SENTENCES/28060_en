BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said on Wednesday (October 20th) he does not rule out a cabinet shuffle in a bid to reduce the number of ministries.
Cvetkovic also said such a decision depends entirely on agreement among the coalition partners.
The possibility of reducing the number of ministries has been discussed since 2009 in a bid to consolidate public finances.

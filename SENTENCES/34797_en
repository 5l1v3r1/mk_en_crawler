ANKARA, Turkey -- So far 760 Turkish militants have applied for amnesty under the rehabilitation law that took effect last week, according to a report Saturday (9 August) by the Anadolu agency.
The law grants pardons or reduced sentences to repentant members of terrorist organisations, primarily the 5,000 members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), now known as KADEK.
PKK began fighting for self-rule in the predominantly Kurdish southeast almost 20 years ago;
36,000 people have died in the conflict.
KADEK has officially refused the government's offer of amnesty, saying it was a ploy to disband the group.
KADEK also warned that it would end its unilateral ceasefire on 1 September if Turkish authorities fail to adopt a similar measure.
The ceasefire has been in effect for four years.

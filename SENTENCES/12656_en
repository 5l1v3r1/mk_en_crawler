THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said Friday (4 March) that Croatia has only days to meet the deadline for proving its full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Asselborn's statement followed talks with UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, whose report on Croatia will be crucial in determining whether the Union starts accession talks with Zagreb on 17 March, as scheduled.
Del Ponte has repeatedly criticised the Croatian authorities for their failure to extradite retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN court's most-wanted indictees.

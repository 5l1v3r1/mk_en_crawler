BELGRADE, Serbia -- Opening the first session of a Diaspora Assembly in parliament, President Boris Tadic said on Saturday (July 3rd) that Serbia will never stop protecting the national identity of Serbs living outside its borders.
He added that establishing the assembly, which includes 45 delegates from around the globe, is a step forward in protecting the national, cultural and religious identity of Serbs around the world and is a response to challenges facing the country.
Between 3.5 million and 4 million Serbs live outside their homeland, Tadic said, noting they contribute significantly to the country's economy.

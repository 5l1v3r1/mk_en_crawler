VIENNA, Austria -- The sixth round of Kosovo decentralisation negotiations ended in Vienna on Wednesday (31 May) without any concrete agreement between delegations from Belgrade and Pristina.
The focus was on economic issues, including privatisation in Kosovo and the province's external debt, which is currently served by Serbia.
Afterwards, UN deputy envoy Albert Rohan, who chaired the session, stressed that complex economic issues must be resolved, regardless of the outcome of the status settlement process.
In other news, an unknown gunman killed a young Kosovo Serb in a roadside attack Wednesday night.
UNMIK says the ambush occurred as Miljan Veskovic drove home along the Zvecan-Zitkovec road.
Earlier in the day, a bomb damaged a bridge in Kosovo that connects two villages -- Grabac and Bic -- populated mainly by Serb returnees.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi signed decrees Friday (July 25th) on the proposed reshuffle of the cabinet led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
The move confirmed making Anila Godo health minister, Fatos Beja education minister and Genc Pollo the new deputy prime minister.
Meeting with other Balkans leaders in Salzburg on Sunday, Berisha said the region's EU integration is "a return to the old family".
"The inclusion of the Western Balkans ...
will cost the EU less than rejecting its integration," he said.

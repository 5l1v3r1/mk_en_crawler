PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier visited Kosovo on Monday (6 September), saying he sees a new beginning there, one leading to ethnic reconciliation and peace. 
He urged the adoption of a "new way of thinking" that would build trust among residents of the province. 
Barnier singled out security for minorities, economic reform and law and order as priorities that would have to be met before a decision can be made on the final status of Kosovo. 
Barnier met President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, new KFOR commander General Yves de Kermabon and UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.

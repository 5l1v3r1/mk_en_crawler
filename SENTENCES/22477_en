ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) plans to transfer its lawmakers to another party if the Constitutional Court ends up banning the AKP for alleged anti-secular activity, local media reported on Sunday (July 13th). 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly agreed on this option with Tuna Beklevic, leader of the Powerful Turkey Party (GTP). 
Chief Public Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya filed a case against the AKP in March, requesting the banning of the party and 70 of its senior officials.
In other news, Istanbul Chief Prosecutor Aykut Cengiz Engin filed an indictment Monday for 85 suspects detained in connection with the Ergenekon probe. 
The ultra-nationalist secularist group allegedly was plotting a coup. 
The indictment charges that its members formed a terrorist cell that planned to launch a destabilisation campaign in order to overthrow the pro-Islamic government. 
The court will approve or return the indictment within two weeks.

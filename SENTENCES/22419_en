ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court's upcoming ruling in the closure case against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will not destabilise the country, since Turkey is strong enough to handle such a situation, the court's head, Hasim Kilic, said on Monday (July 14th).
"We don't have any doomsday coming.
This country has survived so many things.
Turkey's institutions are fulfilling their duties, so nobody should be concerned," Kilic told reporters.
While he refused to announce a date for a ruling, the deputy chairman of the court, Osman Paksut, said the case might conclude by the end of July or beginning of August.
The AKP faces charges of threatening Turkey's secular character.

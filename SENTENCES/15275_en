ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court on Friday (28 July) acquitted writer Orhan Pamuk of charges of insulting the nation in comments he made about the killings of Armenians and Kurds. 
The verdict ended a case watched closely by the EU, which has voiced concerns over freedom of speech in Turkey. 
According to local media reports, however, an Istanbul court has decided to open a case against another Turkish writer, Elif Safak, charged with "denigrating Turkishness in the press". 
Prosecutors are seeking up to three years in prison.

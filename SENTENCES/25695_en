SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Local media reported on Thursday (November 19th) that the Appeals Court has overturned a verdict against former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski stemming from his involvement in an arms deal. 
The court has ordered a review of the case due to procedural violations, reports said. 
But Court President Jordan Mitrinovski told the Utrinski Vesnik that no ruling has been made, as judges have only discussed the case.
Last year, both Buckovski and former Army Chief of General Staff Metodi Stamboliski were sentenced to three and a half years in prison after being found guilty of abuse of power and corruption. 
The case stemmed from a 2.4m-euro purchase of spare parts for army tanks in 2001, when Buckovski was defence minister.

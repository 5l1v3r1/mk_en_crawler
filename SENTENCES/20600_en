LONDON, United Kingdom -- Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo remains the basis for the new round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina, the EU envoy to the negotiations said Thursday (August 9th).
German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger spoke after a meeting between the EU-Russia-US "troika" and the Contact Group for Kosovo.
"It is not our job as a troika to make new proposals," Ischinger said.
"It is a fact that the Ahtisaari plan is on the table."
Members of the troika will meet with Serbian negotiators in Belgrade on Friday, followed by talks in Pristina on Saturday.

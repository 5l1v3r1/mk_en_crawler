ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday (December 6th) to discuss the Middle East, peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and relations between Turkey and the Palestinian territories.
Gul said after the meeting that in order for peace to prevail in the Middle East, the Palestinian territories must become an independent country.
Abbas heads to Greece on Tuesday.
In other news, a Danish court ruled on Monday that the bank accounts of the Kurdish TV station Roj TV -- frozen in August over accusations that the channel was a mouthpiece for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) -- should be released.
The appeals court upheld a ruling from October, which said all ten bank accounts containing around 43,900 euros should be unfrozen.
According to the judge, freezing the accounts violated European laws protecting freedom of expression.

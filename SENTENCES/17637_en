BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's (EP) foreign affairs committee adopted a report Tuesday (March 27th) on Croatia's progress in the EU integration process, suggesting entry as early as 2009.
Approval of the document, prepared by the EP rapporteur for Croatia, Hannes Swoboda of Austria, marked the first official statement by an EU institution acknowledging possible early accession.

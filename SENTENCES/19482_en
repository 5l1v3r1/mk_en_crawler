ANKARA, Turkey -- In separate statements Thursday (December 27th), the governments of Southeast European countries condemned the assassination of Pakistan's opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto. 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry called on the people of Pakistan to "not allow acts of terrorism ... 
to destroy the democratisation process". 
President Abdullah Gul, who met with Bhutto during a visit to Pakistan earlier this month, urged the international community to assist Pakistan as it prepares for January parliamentary elections.
The Albanian government also expressed deep sorrow over Thursday's murder, saying it underscores the need for the international community to step up efforts against terrorism. 
Bulgaria extended its deepest condolences to Bhutto's family, while Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis described Bhutto as an "international personality who struggled steadfastly for democracy, peace, respect for human dignity and reconciliation in her country".
Pakistan's former prime minister was shot to death at an election rally in Rawalpindi. 
Her attacker then blew himself up, killing at least 22 other people. 
Later in the day, the chief of al-Qaeda's operations in Afghanistan claimed to have ordered the assassination.

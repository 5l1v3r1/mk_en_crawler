SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A court in Skopje decided on Tuesday (February 8th) to unfreeze the bank accounts of A1 TV. 
The accounts of the popular TV channel and dailies Spic, Vreme and Koha E Re were blocked in late January as part of a tax fraud investigation against ten companies registered at A1's address. 
The move triggered a parliamentary boycott by some opposition parties led by SDSM, who claimed that the decision was politically motivated.

TIRANA, Albania -- At a meeting on Saturday (29 November), the parliamentary group of Albania's ruling Socialist Party (SP) agreed that there is a need for a government reshuffle.
The parliamentarians said that besides the issue of filling the two vacant seats at the foreign and public order ministries, there are other problems in the government's work which necessitate broader changes.
Prime Minister and SP Chairman Fatos Nano said that it is high time for appreciation of the work of every minister in his cabinet, adding that he would kick off political consultations on the reshuffle.(ATA - 29/11/03)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) has shown insufficient co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, failing to answer repeated demands for access to wartime archives, according to a joint statement issued Friday (27 January) by the tribunal's office in BiH, the Office of the High Representative, and the BiH Council of Ministers.
UN prosecutors have been seeking to examine documents used by Radovan Karadzic's staff, records of the RS army command, and the RS presidency's archive.
Banja Luka is expected to fulfil its international obligations, including by handing over remaining fugitives and providing the requested documentation, the joint statement said.

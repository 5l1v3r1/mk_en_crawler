ZAGREB, Croatia -- A 27-year-old Dutch tourist was seriously injured when he stepped on a landmine on the southern Croatian island of Vis, authorities reported Thursday (21 July).
Archaeologist Stek Tesse Djeder had gone hiking on a mountain and was in an area that was not marked as a minefield.
Surgeons had to amputate his foot.
Landmines continue to claim lives in Croatia and neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina 10 years after the end of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
This is the first incident involving a tourist.

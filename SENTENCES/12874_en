BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU presidency said Tuesday (1 February) that Serbia-Montenegro could not hope to join the EU without full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told visiting Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic that the voluntary surrender of retired General Vladimir Lazarevic and his pending extradition cannot be considered 100 per cent co-operation. 
At a special session the same day, the Serbian cabinet pledged to improve ties with the tribunal.
Lazarevic will travel to The Hague on Thursday, accompanied by Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic. 
The ex-general has been indicted for his role in the Kosovo conflict.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is expected to recommend the admission of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU on 1 January 2007, international media reported Monday (3 April). 
However, the EC will demand further reforms from both countries. 
If the EU leaders agree to the recommendation, Bulgaria and Romania will join the Union on schedule, but risk being cut off financially if they fail to meet the recommended reforms -- most notably in the judiciary and the fight against crime and corruption.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, meanwhile, was due to brief the European Parliament Monday evening. 
Rehn has said that 2006 "is the worst possible time for the EU to go wobbly on its commitment to future enlargement", as the Balkans have started to emerge from a period of nationalism and war, and are ready to join the European family of nations.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition announced on Thursday (November 27th) that it is dropping plans to call for a vote of no-confidence against the government after three big opposition parties -- the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) and the Bulgarian New Democracy -- refused to back a motion launched by two independents in parliament, Yani Yanev and Dimitar Abadzhiev. 
The pair had called for the motion after the European Commission refused to restore the accreditation of two payment agencies that once managed funds under the PHARE programmes, effectively depriving Bulgaria of hundreds of millions of euros under the programme. 
The UDF and the DSB insist that a no-confidence motion would be inappropriate during the ongoing budget procedure.
In other news Thursday, the Netherlands announced it will not open its labour market to Romanians and Bulgarians next year due to growing fears of unemployment among its own workers. 
"This doesn't mean that we will not allow them [Bulgarians and Romanians] by 2010 or 2011, when the economy starts booming again and we need the people," Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment spokeswoman Bea Versteeg said.

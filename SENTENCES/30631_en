PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Steering Committee of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) decided on Monday (February 14th) to nominate Behgjet Pacolli, leader New Kosovo Alliance (AKR), for president. 
The committee withdrew Jakup Krasniqi's candidacy and accepted the AKR's conditions. 
In all, the AKR is expected to get up to five ministerial posts, while the PDK will hold the posts of prime minister and parliament speaker. 
The Ibrahim Rugova List is also expected to be part of the government coalition with one lawmaker, as well as most of the minority parties who have 25 representatives in the parliament. 
The coalition agreement was reached more than two months after snap elections in December.

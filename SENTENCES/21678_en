PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Pieter Feith, head of the International Civilian Office in Kosovo, said on Thursday (May 22nd) that after June 15th -- when Kosovo's Constitution takes effect -- Kosovo's institutions will assume all duties envisioned under UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan.
After a meeting of the International Steering Group in Pristina, Feith said the EU mandate foresees the deployment of staff across the entire territory, including the Serb-dominated north.
"Personally, I am happy with the progress in the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan and the process of decentralisation," Feith said.
In other news Thursday, the Serbian foreign ministry filed a protest with Prague, a day after the Czech government formally recognised Kosovo's independence.
Serbia is also recalling its ambassador to Prague, as it has done with the 40 other countries that have recognised Kosovo.

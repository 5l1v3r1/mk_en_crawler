TIRANA, Albania -- The government on Wednesday (January 13th) described its reaction to the two weeks of flooding as a success and offered guaranteed compensation to those affected.
"It has been a successful humanitarian operation which will be marked in history," Prime Minister Sali Berisha told a cabinet meeting in the north western town of Shkodra.
He added that the public had been warned in time, and he rejected claims by the opposition suggesting the situation was mismanaged.
The area affected in Shkodra is estimated now at an area encompassing 11,400 hectares.
The General Prosecutors Office meanwhile is looking into the possible mismanagement of hydro plants and dams amid torrential rains.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal on Wednesday (20 July) ruled against a former Bosnian Serb politician appealing the 10-year sentence he received in 2004. 
The judges unanimously rejected Miroslav Deronjic's four grounds of appeal, including the allegation that the original panel of judges had failed to take mitigating circumstances into consideration. 
Deronjic, a former Serbian Democratic Party senior official in the Bratunac area, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to persecution in the 1992 destruction of the village of Glogova and the murder of 60 Muslims by Bosnian Serb forces. 
Prosecutors dropped several other charges against him as part of the plea bargain.
In other news Wednesday, the UN tribunal's Referral Bench decided to transfer to the BiH State Court a war crimes case involving four Bosnian Serbs: Zeljko Mejakic, Momcilo Gruban, Dusan Fustar and Dusko Knezevic. 
They are charged with crimes against non-Serbs -- Bosniaks and Croats -- in the Omarska and Keraterm camps in BiH between May and August 1992. 
The decision is in line with the UN Security Council's stance that the tribunal should concentrate on trials of prime suspects while lower-level cases should be referred to national jurisdictions.

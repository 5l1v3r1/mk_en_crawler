BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors in Belgrade issued an indictment Thursday (April 10th) for Milorad Pejic, a British citizen of Croatian Serb origin believed to be involved in the 1991 Ovcara farm massacre.
He is suspected of participating in the execution of around 200 Croat prisoners of war at the farm while allegedly a member of the Vukovar Territorial Defence.
Pejic, who lives in the UK, was arrested on an international warrant last month at the Nikola Tesla airport in Belgrade.

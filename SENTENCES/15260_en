TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu met with his Kosovo counterpart Fatmir Sejdiu in Tirana on Tuesday (27 June) and reiterated Albania's support for an independent and sovereign Kosovo.
During the meeting, and later in a speech to parliament, Sejdiu stressed that Kosovo's chief priority -- after resolving the status issue -- is integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
He added that Kosovo Albanians must live in peace with Serbs in the province.
In other news, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen began a series of farewell meetings Wednesday with representatives of the province's interim institutions, political parties and NGOs.
He is stepping down on Friday, after two years on the job.

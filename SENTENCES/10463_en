BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During a visit to NATO Headquarters on Monday (18 October), Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul predicted his country might be invited to join the Pact next summer. 
Zuzul held talks with NATO Deputy Secretary General Alessandro Minuto Rizzo, Assistant Secretary General for Political Issues Guenter Altenburg and US Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns. 
He said the three praised the progress achieved by Croatia in implementing defence reforms.
Also Monday, trade unions in the Croatian educational sector warned that they would launch another general strike unless the government agrees to negotiate on their demand for a 12 per cent salary hike. 
Despite a strike earlier this month, the government has refused to discuss a wage increase.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament's justice committee approved a draft anti-terror law on Thursday (22 June).
The bill includes recommendations made by army representatives, but the committee turned down a proposal by the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), which wants the law to cover unarmed organisations.
CHP says the lapse could lead to a weakness in fighting religious fundamentalism, but the ruling Justice and Development Party says the present version fully corresponds to the international legislation against terrorism.
In other news, the World Bank approved the second tranche of the Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan III for Turkey, the treasury department said Thursday.
The $500m loan aims to support comprehensive reforms in public and finance sectors, as well as in agriculture.

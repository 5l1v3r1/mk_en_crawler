SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A gunman killed three people and injured another late on Tuesday (June 3rd) in the town of Bihac. 
Police say Sero Hadzic first gunned down a Turkish national in the town before killing a man and his 24-year-old son. 
Later, Hadzic allegedly wounded a fourth man in the village of Pokoj before being captured by police. 
The incident follows a similar shooting spree in which a mentally ill gunman killed six in the village of Lipnica, near Tuzla. 
Tomislav Petrovic, 45, admitted his guilt on Wednesday and expressed remorse.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic has said the entity defence ministries will likely be abolished at the end of this year.
In an interview published in the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine on Sunday (3 July), Radovanovic said that if the entity parliaments back the recommendations of the BiH Defence Reform Commission, the most logical timeframe for closing the two entities' ministries would be the end of December, as the current accounting year ends then.
On Sunday meanwhile, the House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Nikola Spiric urged the prosecutor's office to investigate cases in which foreign Islamic fighters received BiH citizenship during the war.
At a news conference, Spiric, also a top official of Republika Srpska's major opposition Union of Independent Social Democrats, said the matter is crucial to both domestic and international security.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chief of the European Commission (EC) delegation to BiH, Michael Humphreys, has called for the completion of talks on police sector restructuring and adoption of the law on public broadcasting as major preconditions for a positive Feasibility Study later this month. 
In an interview with the BiH daily Nezavisne novine Monday (9 May), Humphreys said he hopes next week's round of political discussions about police reform would lead to a political solution, ahead of an EC assessment mission to Sarajevo on 19 May. 
A panel formed to map the new police regions in BiH is meeting for the first time Monday in Sarajevo.
In other news, the BiH Ministry of Civil Affairs announced on Friday that a total of 2,363,068 identity cards and 974,527 driving licenses were issued as of 30 April. 
Applications for new identity documents must be received by the end of May as part of the Citizens' Identification Protection System initiative.

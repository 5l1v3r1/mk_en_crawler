THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Lawyers representing Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac said on Tuesday (May 17th) they have filed motions appealing their clients' war crimes sentences. 
The deadline was midnight Monday. 
Last month, the UN tribunal convicted Gotovina and Markac of war crimes stemming from the 1991-1995 war in Croatian and sentenced them to prison for 24 and 18 years respectively. 
The two were found guilty of taking part in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at forcibly and permanently removing the Serb population from occupied areas of Croatia during and after Operation Storm. 
A third general, Ivan Cermak, was acquitted.

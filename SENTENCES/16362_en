PARIS, France -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev says France would not be threatened by a massive influx of Bulgarian workers after the country's EU accession next year.
Speaking at a news conference Thursday (October 12th) on the sidelines of an economic forum on behalf of Bulgaria, organised by the French Chamber of Commerce in Paris, Stanishev acknowledged the issue of free movement of the labour force is a sensitive one for the EU, but said the threat is exaggerated.
He also stressed the potential for boosting Bulgarian-French economic relations.

TIRANA, Albania -- Health Minister Petrit Vasili announced on Thursday (April 1st) plans to build five new hospitals this year. 
"We can easily say that there is a 'boom' of investments in the hospital service," Vasili told a parliamentary health panel. 
Two of the new hospitals will be based in Tirana, one in Kavaja, one in Elbasan, and one in Shkodra.

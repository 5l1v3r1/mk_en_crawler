BUCHAREST, Romania -- Valentin Ceausescu, son of late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena, announced on Wednesday (November 3rd) that DNA tests have confirmed that his parents' grave contains their remains. 
The bodies were exhumed for testing amid family concerns that the couple was not actually buried in the grave at Bucharest's Ghencea military cemetery. 
Valentin Ceausescu, 62, says the results finally resolved any doubts.

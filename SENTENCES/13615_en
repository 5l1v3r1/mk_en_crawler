ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a surprise visit to the predominantly Kurdish town of Semdinli on Monday (21 November) to reassure local residents that his government does not condone violence against them.
There has been unrest in the city since a paramilitary sergeant was arrested in connection with the bombing of a local bookstore.
Erdogan promised that he would launch an investigation to determine if any elements of the military were involved in terrorist acts against Kurds.
He also appealed for calm.
Parliament meets Tuesday to discuss tensions in the region.

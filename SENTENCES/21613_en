TIRANA, Albania -- Following approval by parliament of constitutional amendments concerning the electoral system, the coalition of left-wing parties has split over the issue.
The leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), Ilir Meta, on Tuesday (April 22nd) accused Socialist Party (SP) leader and ally Edi Rama of a "political putsch" for joining Prime Minister Sali Berisha's Democratic Party (DP) in supporting the changes.
Meta criticised Rama for betraying socialist principles and leftist voters.
He added the constitutional changes of the "Berisha-Rama co-governance" would destroy democracy.
Another ally of the SP, the Democratic Alliance Party, also announced it will stop co-operating with the Socialists.

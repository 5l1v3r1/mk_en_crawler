ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Zagreb on Friday (March 12th) convicted a man for the murder of a young lawyer in 2008, which at the time led to the ousting of the country's justice and interior ministers. 
Mladen Slogar was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the "grave killing caused by ruthless revenge". 
Ivana Hodak, 26, was shot dead in the hallway of her apartment building in October 2008. 
Her father, Zvonimir Hodak, is a prominent lawyer. 
Prosecutors say that Slogar, a homeless person, killed the woman after her father failed to give him a job he had promised. 
The shooting, in broad daylight, prompted the immediate dismissal of Interior Minister Berislav Roncevic, Justice Minister Ana Lovrin and Zagreb Police Chief Marijan Benko.

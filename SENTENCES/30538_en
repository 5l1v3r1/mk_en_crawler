TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament backed a proposal Wednesday (February 16th) to lift the immunity of former Economy and Trade Minister and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta.
This allows prosecutors to investigate allegations of corruption.
Meta resigned in mid-January after a local television channel broadcast video that purportedly showed him trying to influence a government tender.
Meta reiterated on Wednesday that the video was a set-up.

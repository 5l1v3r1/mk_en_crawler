PARIS, France -- France says that conditions have not been set for Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen border-free zone in March 2011, as the two hoped, and that the decision on admission should be delayed until summer. 
"Both countries have made efforts and made real progress â¦ but the assessment process is not yet complete," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Bernard Valero said on Friday (November 12th). 
He added it would be best to wait for the European Commission's report on the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism in July. 
The post-accession mechanism was set up to closely monitor the two countries' efforts to reform their judiciaries and fight corruption and organised crime.

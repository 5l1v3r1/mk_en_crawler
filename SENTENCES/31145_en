ATHENS, Greece -- The government reiterated on Tuesday (January 4th) its intention to build a fence along the country's border with Turkey to control the influx of illegal migrants. 
The Citizen Protection Ministry said the fence, which will be 12.5km long and 3m high will be erected by April near the river of Evros and the town of Orestiada. 
The length is much smaller than the 206km mentioned at the weekend. 
The fresh statement followed heavy criticism from European officials, who advised Greece to reform its asylum system instead. 
The government rejected this advice Tuesday. 
"'It is duplicitous that the same people who accuse Greece of not living up to its obligations under the Schengen agreement are now criticising it because it is trying to strengthen its borders," Citizen Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis said.

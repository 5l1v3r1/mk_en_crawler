NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Farmers from all over Cyprus launched a protest Monday (September 29th) by blocking major roads with tractors, trucks and farm vehicles. 
They also set up blockades near the presidential palace in the capital, Nicosia. 
The protesters want financial compensation for this summer's crippling drought, which damaged their crops. 
They seek a meeting with President Demetris Christofias to demand more than doubling the proposed subsidy to 145m euros. 
The state has offered farmers 67.5m euros.

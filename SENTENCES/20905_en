SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski insisted on Sunday (November 4th) that Macedonia will not change its name as Greece demands, even if it costs the country a chance at NATO membership.
Gruevski told the MIA news agency that Greece will actively lobby against Macedonia's NATO bid if Skopje does not agree to change its name.
But at a recent meeting between Gruevski and President Branko Crvenkovski, they agreed that changing the name would be too high a price to pay.
Menduh Thaci, leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians, echoed that sentiment after a meeting with Gruevski on Sunday.

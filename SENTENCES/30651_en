NICOSIA, Cyprus -- About 5,000 Turkish Cypriot union members gathered in the northern part of the capital Thursday (April 7th) for a protest against austerity measures implemented by their government.
They accuse Turkey of standing behind the measures, which include private and public sector salary cuts.
Minor scuffles occurred during the rally, which featured a strong police presence.
This was the third such protest in as many months.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- As expected, Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru lost a vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday (November 4th). 
Of the 458 lawmakers who participated, 250 voted against his proposed cabinet, and 189 supported it. 
Afterwards, Croitoru said he was through, having presented a cabinet he thought the country needed. 
Hours later, President Traian Basescu said he would start consultations Thursday with parties in parliament about a new prime-minister designate, but added he will not name Klaus Johannis to the post. 
Johannis was the candidate opposition parties wanted, before Basescu unilaterally nominated Croitoru.

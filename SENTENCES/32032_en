BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Belgian Parliament will ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Croatia and the EU by the end of the year, says Herman de Croo, head of the House of Representatives of the Belgian Parliament. 
He met Thursday (17 October) with Croatian Defence Minister Zeljka Antunovic. 
So far, the SAA has been ratified by Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. 
On Monday, Great Britain announced that it would suspend the ratification as long as Zagreb refuses to extradite Gen Janko Bobetko to the UN war crimes tribunal.

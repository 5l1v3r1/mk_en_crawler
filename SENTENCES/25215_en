SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament adopted cabinet changes Wednesday (January 27th) after the resignation of Rumyana Zheleva as foreign minister. 
Defence Minister Nikolay Mladenov replaces Zheleva as foreign minister while Mladenov's deputy -- Anyu Angelov -- became minister of defence. 
The only opposition came from the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, neither of which has enough votes to block the changes.

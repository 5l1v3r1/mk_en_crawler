THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal will return four suspended cases stemming from the 2001 interethnic conflict in Macedonia to local authorities, chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Monday (25 April), after meeting with Macedonian Justice Minister Meri Mladenovska-Gjorgjievska and Public Prosecutor Aleksandar Prcevski in The Hague. 
They visited the tribunal to discuss the ongoing trial against former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and former security officer Johan Tarculovski. 
The two have been charged with crimes against ethnic Albanian civilians in Ljuboten. 
The other four cases involve crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Albanian guerrillas against Macedonian civilians.

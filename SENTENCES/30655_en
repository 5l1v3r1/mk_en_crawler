ANKARA, Turkey -- Over 10,000 doctors and medical students gathered in front of the health ministry in Ankara on Sunday (March 13th) to protest a government decision to introduce a new healthcare system. 
Protestors argue the new system would lower the quality of health care since under it, workers would be paid based on the number of patients they tend. 
The government, on the other hand, argues the system would boost competition and result in higher salaries to doctors who perform better.

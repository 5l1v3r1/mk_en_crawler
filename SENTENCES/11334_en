ZAGREB, Croatia -- The World Bank decided on Wednesday (22 December) to double its assistance to Croatia to a total of $1.5 billion over four years. 
The move is aimed at ensuring Zagreb's successful EU accession. 
The bank also urged the Croatian government to shift its focus "from public sector expenditures and consumption to private sector investment and productivity".

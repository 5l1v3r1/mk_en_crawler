How best to inventory and re-distribute all official property owned by a national government?
In late December, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) gave BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric a list of all state property either owned or managed by former Yugoslav authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The information -- compiled over five months and listing 1,000 items such as army barracks and other government buildings -- was turned over to the current government to be appropriately reassigned.
Spiric has said that "political consensus" must be met before the property is re-assigned, a dim prospect at the moment.
Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, for instance, called the inventory "illegal and unacceptable".
He says items on the OHR list include offices of the RS presidency and the national assembly, buildings that "belong only to the country's entities and cannot be ceded".
Others say the process could have been completed long ago if RS had co-operated by providing property boundaries and other land records within the entity.
Zvonimir Kutlesa, head of a local team working on a first draft of the Law on State Property, says the OHR inventory isn't much help with his work.
"We must [first] determine the basic principles anyway," Kutlesa said.
And Sulejman Tihic, leader of the main Bosniak Party of the Democratic Action, was somewhat fatalistic about the matter.
"If we are going to politicise [state inventory] and bring up issues that have been already completed, such as privatisation of state property, or include issues of public goods such as rivers, forests, roads … we shall never finalise" it.

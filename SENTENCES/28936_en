ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay was quoted as saying on Wednesday (July 7th) that Turkey will continue military operations against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and will destroy PKK camps in northern Iraq.
"The time for words is over.
It is time for action now," Atalay told a press conference after meeting Tuesday with the editors of several leading dailies in Ankara.
"No country would allow camps of a terrorist organisation to target a neighbouring country.
No constitution of any country would allow it.
It also contradicts international ethics and policies.
This is what we underlined at the tripartite mechanism meetings with the US and Iraq," he added.

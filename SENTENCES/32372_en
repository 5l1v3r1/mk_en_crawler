SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government announced on Thursday (27 March) that it was sending five liaison officers to the US central command in Tampa, Florida, and five more officers to Kuwait.
They will co-ordinate the deployment of about 150 Bulgarian chemical decontamination specialists near Iraq.
The National Assembly voted last month to contribute troops to the US-led campaign and permit the United States to use its airspace and an airfield.
In other news, Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said he saw no need to expel Iraqi diplomats from Bulgaria for the time being, while Foreign Minister Solomon Passy seemed to suggest that no decision had been made.
Washington had asked 56 countries to expel the diplomats.
Also Thursday, Passy announced that Bulgaria had been invited to participate in the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.

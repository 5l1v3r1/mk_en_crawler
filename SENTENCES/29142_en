SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry says police busted an unregistered branch of an outlawed radical Islamist organisation Wednesday (October 6th), in a joint operation with prosecutors and the State Agency for National Security. 
Raided were homes and offices of imams in several villages in the districts of Blagoevgrad, Pazardzhik and Smolyan. 
Police say they found a large amount of propaganda material about the Al-Waqf Al-Islam organisation, as well as financial documents indicating illegal transactions and breaches of local tax legislation. 
The group was once based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, but was banned there after the 9/11 attacks in the United States for suspected links to al-Qaeda.

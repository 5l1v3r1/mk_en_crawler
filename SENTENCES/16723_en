SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government endorsed on Wednesday (6 September) a draft law on police, considered a key requirement for EU integration.
Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska noted that due to the importance of the legislation, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE would seek to ensure a broad political consensus.
Attempts by the former government to pass the law failed due to a disagreement with its coalition partner, the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union of Integration.

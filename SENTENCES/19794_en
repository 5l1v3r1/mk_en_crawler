SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A Macedonian police officer died, and two others were seriously injured, in an ambush by gunmen on Wednesday (October 24th). 
The three were on patrol near the village of Tanusevci, 20km north of Skopje, when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle with automatic weapons. 
A manhunt was launched, but the attackers are believed to have fled into Kosovo. 
Tanusevci was a centre of the 2001 ethnic Albanian insurgency in Macedonia.

BERLIN, Germany -- A new study finds 60 per cent of Germans would support Turkey's bid for membership in the EU if the country meets certain conditions.
The research, by the German-based Foundation for Turkish Studies, found 32 per cent are opposed to the bid because of concerns over respect for democracy and human rights in Turkey.
An estimated 2.5 million Turks live in Germany.
In other news, Turkey and Greece announced Thursday (11 December) that they have reached an agreement to improve air traffic services between the two countries.
The deal was seen as easing congestion and enhancing air safety.
Efforts to reach an agreement had been blocked earlier by a dispute concerning air traffic control over the Aegean, resulting in accusations of airspace violations.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell congratulated Romania's new Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, in a phone conversation last week.

In other news, a new law imposing severe restrictions on international adoptions took effect on Saturday (1 January). 
Foreigners can now adopt Romanian children only if the search for Romanian adoptive families has failed. 
The legislation was passed under pressure from the EU and follows a moratorium on international adoptions imposed in 2001.

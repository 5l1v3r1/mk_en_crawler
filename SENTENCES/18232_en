ATHENS, Greece -- US Ambassador to Greece Charles Ries said on Tuesday (January 16th) that he is satisfied with the collaboration shown by Greek authorities in investigating last week's terror attack on the US Embassy in Athens. 
Ries told local NET TV that efforts to track down the perpetrators continue and that FBI agents have joined in the investigation. 
The rocket attack prompted government spokesman Evangelos Antonaros to call for the lifting of restrictions on the use of cameras installed in the city for the 2004 Olympics. 
The Greek Data Protection Agency imposed limits on their use amid concerns over residents' privacy.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte told reporters Wednesday (16 April) that she has seen major improvement in Zagreb's co-operation with the UN tribunal.
"I am sure that in the future it will be much easier to obtain full co-operation with Croatia.
Perhaps the next visit will be just to thank them for full co-operation," she said.
Del Ponte noted, however, that Zagreb must arrest and extradite Gen Ante Gotovina and provide access to classified defence ministry documents.
Also Wednesday, AFP reported that the EU is considering a measure that would ban entry to individuals suspected of helping war crimes indictees.
A list is being prepared with updates planned as new information becomes available.

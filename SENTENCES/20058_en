BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia is very close to full membership in NATO with little left to do, Alliance Secretary-General Jap de Hoop Scheffer told Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader during a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday (January 16th). 
De Hoop Scheffer said Croatia clearly contributes to regional security, indicating the country will be invited to join the Alliance at the April summit. 
But he urged Croatia to go the extra mile. 
Sanader, who addressed the decision-making North Atlantic Council, said he was very satisfied with his visit.

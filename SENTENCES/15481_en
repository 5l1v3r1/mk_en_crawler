SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new parliament held its constituent session on Wednesday (26 July), three weeks after the general election. 
The deputies, however, were unable to select a speaker, as no candidate backed by the required minimum of 20 deputies was submitted to the nominating committee. 
Until a new speaker is elected, Stojan Andov will continue acting as interim chairman. 
As for prime minister-designate, the frontrunner remains Nikola Gruevski, leader of the VMRO-DPMNE, which won the majority of votes in the 5 July elections. 
Still unclear is the final composition of the ruling coalition.

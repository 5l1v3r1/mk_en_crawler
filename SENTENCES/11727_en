ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government told the EU in a letter released on Thursday (17 February) that it would do its best to improve co-operation with the UN tribunal, though it stopped short of a pledge to arrest and extradite retired General Ante Gotovina.
The letter followed a string of warnings from senior EU officials.
Pressure mounted further on Thursday when Polish Foreign Minister Adam Rotfeld met with chief UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
Afterwards, he said the EU would not open accession talks with Croatia if Gotovina were not handed over to the tribunal by 17 March.
In other news, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic was sworn in as minister of foreign and European affairs on Thursday.
She was elected to parliament in 2003, becoming European affairs minister the same year.
Following former foreign minister Miomir Zuzul's resignation and a decision by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to merge the foreign and European affairs ministries, Grabar-Kitarovic was chosen to take over the combined portfolio.
Parliament also approved other cabinet changes Thursday.
Neven Ljubicic was appointed health minister and Damir Polancec was appointed deputy prime minister responsible for economic policy.

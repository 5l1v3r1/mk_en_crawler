SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak reprimanded BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic on Monday (December 15th), saying his irresponsible speeches have aggravated the political situation in BiH.
The statement came after Silajdzic accused Lajcak of supporting Republika Srpska's obstruction to state-level integration.
Lajcak urged Silajdzic and other BiH politicians to start acting like real statesmen and urged them to consider the reasons behind a series of failures, including the lack of an eased visa regime from the EU.

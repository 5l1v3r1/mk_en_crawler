BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), said Monday (19 January) that his party would pull out of negotiations on forming a new government if the other democratic parties fail to reach agreement.
He warned that the plan now under consideration is the last chance for a deal.
DSS finished second in last month's parliamentary elections.
The Democratic Party (DS) has indicated it is likely to support the democratic cabinet.
The DS, meanwhile, now has two nominees vying for party leader.
Incumbent Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic is facing off against Federal Defence Minister Boris Tadic.
The party will decide next month.

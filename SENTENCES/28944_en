BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police detained and questioned the wife of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic on Tuesday (June 8th) for possession of suspected illegal weapons. 
Bosiljka Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, told the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti that the weapons were seized during a December 2008 raid of the family home in Belgrade. 
He insists her detention is in response to efforts by the family to have Mladic declared dead. 
Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, denies that, saying the government is applying no pressure on Mladic's family.

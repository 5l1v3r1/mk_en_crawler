SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition party VMRO-DPMNE sent a letter Saturday (13 March) demanding at least the same number of OSCE election monitors as in the parliamentary elections in 2002.
The letter, sent to the OSCE mission to Skopje and to several foreign diplomatic offices in Macedonia, cited "serious indications of possible irregularities" in the elections.
In other news, Macedonia hosted a meeting of experts from the other signatories of the Adriatic Charter -- Albania, Croatia and the United States -- on Friday.
It was the first in a series of meetings ahead of NATO's June summit in Istanbul.

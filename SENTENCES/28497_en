ANKARA, Turkey -- The government of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) on Wednesday (April 14th) officially turned down a proposal by the opposition People's Republican Party (CHP) to consider separately three controversial amendments contained in a package of reforms parliament headed for debate.
The three amendments address more difficult issues, including party closures and changes to the structure of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors.
The CHP had indicated that considering them separately would better assure passage of the other amendments.
Appearing Wednesday on the private NTV news channel, Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said that the CHP's proposal was a tactical move, since opinion polls indicate majority support for the package should a referendum be required.

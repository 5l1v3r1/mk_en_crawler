LUXEMBOURG -- Bulgaria and Romania sign their accession treaties with the EU during a formal ceremony in Luxembourg on Monday (25 April).
The two countries will join the Union on 1 January 2007 if they meet the criteria for membership by then.
EU leaders approved a protective clause last December under which the accession of either nation could be delayed by a year if it fails to pursue the required reforms.
Romania and Bulgaria must revamp their judiciaries and Bucharest will also have to cancel government subsidies for its steel and other industries.
Both countries would be required to clamp down on organised crime and corruption.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- NATO has endorsed the nomination of Veselin Sukovic as the first Montenegrin Ambassador to the Alliance's Headquarters in Brussels, announced Deputy Defence Minister Ljubisa Perovic on Friday (March 30th). 
He specified that the approval paves the way for the quick opening of Montenegro's first permanent mission to NATO, following the recognition of the Balkan country's independence and its admission to the Partnership for Peace programme last year.
Separately, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence Daniel Fata reaffirmed on Friday the readiness of the United States to assist in the implementation of military reforms in Montenegro. 
Fata visited Podgorica, where he held talks with top representatives of the Montenegrin army.

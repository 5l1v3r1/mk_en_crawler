NEW YORK, United States -- UN war crimes tribunal President Patrick Robinson addressed the UN General Assembly on Thursday (October 8th), urging member states to do their best to ensure that war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic are brought to justice before the end of tribunal's mandate.
"If they are not brought to justice, it will leave a stain on the historic contribution of the UN to peace-building in the former Yugoslavia," Robinson said.
In his annual report, he urged the General Assembly to support the establishment of a commission that would handle compensation claims of war crimes victims in the former Yugoslavia.

BARI, Italy -- On Thursday (18 September), transport ministers of the countries involved in Pan-European Transport Corridor 8 signed an agreement on an investment scheme.
It is expected to pave the way for a new mechanism for financing by the European Investment Bank (EIB), which has indicated it would grant 35-year loans to all involved counties, co-financing 75 per cent of their project-related expenses.
Corridor 8 will run from Durres, Albania to Varna, Bulgaria, passing through Vlore, Tirana, Kafasan, Skopje, Sofia, Plovdiv and Bourgas.
Through the Bulgarian ports, it will connect Europe with Central Asia and the Caucasus.
Meanwhile, Albanian authorities expressed concerns over delays in Corridor 8 construction.
The message was communicated by Albanian Minister of Transport and Telecommunications Spartak Poci at the meeting in Bari.

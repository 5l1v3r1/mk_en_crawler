BELGRADE ,Serbia -- The opposition Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia (DSS-NS) coalition filed a motion with the Constitutional Court on Thursday (December 24th) challenging the constitutionality of the Vojvodina statute. 
They also asked the court to look into a law on the province's jurisdiction that was passed recently. 
It strengthens Vojvodina's autonomy and gives it jurisdiction in 20 areas, including regional development, agriculture, tourism, industry, transportation, health care, the economy and privatisation, as well as mining and energy. 
Vojvodina will also get its own representative in Brussels, though it will not be able to sign international agreements -- only regional ones. 
Critics say the statute is a move in the direction of eventual independence for Vojvodina.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Six more prisoners have decided to join a hunger strike launched by 25 war crime indictees in a Bosnian prison seven days ago. 
The prisoners want their cases to be heard under the war crimes laws of the former Yugoslavia, which were in effect when their crimes were allegedly committed, during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. 
Sentencing guidelines under that earlier legislation resulted in shorter prison terms.

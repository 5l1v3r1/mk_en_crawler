SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government endorsed on Wednesday (February 7th) a decision to extend by one year the mission of Bulgarian troops in Iraq, until the end of March 2008. 
An agreement to this effect was signed with the United States earlier this month. 
Sofia will send troops to replace the current 120 soldiers and 35 support staff in late March, pending approval by Parliament.
Separately, Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Presidency decided on Wednesday to extend the mandate of the BiH Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit in Iraq until the end of this year. 
A total of 36 personnel from all three constituent ethnic groups have been deployed in Iraq since December 2005.

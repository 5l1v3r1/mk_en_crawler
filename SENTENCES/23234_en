SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski on Tuesday (September 30th) accused Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski of obstructing the ongoing talks aimed at resolving the name dispute between Skopje and Athens.
After a meeting with Gruevski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki to discuss the latest proposals by UN envoy Matthew Nimetz, Crvenkovski told reporters "I am calling on the prime minister to act more responsibly in these important times for Macedonia and to be up to meeting these challenges:
in other words, to be a real prime minister." He accused Gruevski of failing to make his views clear.

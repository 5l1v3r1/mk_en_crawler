ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis told the daily Eleftherotypia on Sunday (October 7th) that she expects UN envoy Matthew Nimitz to launch initiatives to settle the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece. 
"Greece is ready to look for a mutually acceptable solution that will be in the interest of the region's stability and prosperity. 
Now is the time for it," Bakoyannis told Eleftherotypia. 
"Macedonia's road to NATO passes through an agreement with Greece over its name."
In addition, Bakoyannis noted that Greece sees an opening in efforts to settle the country's differences with Turkey. 
"Greece and Turkey have two new governments, and currently face a great opportunity to resolve their problems," she said.

LONDON, Britain -- The Contact Group for BiH on Monday (23 May) urged leaders in BiH to ensure a political agreement on crucial police reform, according to a statement issued after a London meeting of the six-nation panel and international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The group urged the Republika Srpska Parliament to authorise local leaders to participate in such accords and enable the realisation of the key reform, adding that it poses no threat to the two BiH entities.
The Contact Group includes representatives of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.
Also Monday, members of the BiH and Croatian parliaments met in Sarajevo.
They agreed that joint efforts should be made to boost bilateral ties and resolve outstanding issues.

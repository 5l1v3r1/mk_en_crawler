PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who represents the EU in the Contact Group troika talks between Belgrade and Pristina, denied on Wednesday (August 22nd) that Brussels supports the partitioning of Kosovo.
In an interview for The Guardian, Ischinger reiterated that partition was never considered a real option, and that neither side ever requested that the province be partitioned into Serb and ethnic Albanian parts.
Ischinger visits Pristina on Thursday to hear the provincial government's ideas ahead of a meeting in Vienna next week.
He may also meet Kosovo Serb representatives.
The envoy will also visit Belgrade soon in preparation for the Vienna talks, part of the ongoing 120 days of negotiations aimed at resolving Kosovo's final status.

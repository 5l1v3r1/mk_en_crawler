BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is asking Western intelligence agencies to help search for The Hague tribunal's most wanted fugitive, former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
In an interview with Reuters on Monday (January 19th), Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that for the time being, the search had produced no results.
He added that while Serbian authorities remain determined to put an end to the war crimes issue, the EU "blackmails Serbia" over it.
Serbia signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in April 2008, but the Netherlands has blocked its implementation until Mladic is behind bars.
In other news Monday, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told The Hague tribunal that he does not have the money to prepare his defence.
During a court session on procedural issues, Karadzic alleged The Hague has deliberately limited his funding to force him to agree to the appointment of an attorney.
Karadzic also criticised a raid on his wife's house in Bosnia and Herzegovina conducted by NATO forces on December 2nd.

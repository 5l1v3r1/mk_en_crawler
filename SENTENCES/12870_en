BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's government said Friday (1 April) that the deadline for extraditing two Serb generals wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal -- Sreten Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic -- was extended from 31 March to 12 April.
The transfer of the indictees to The Hague is a main pre-condition for a positive EU Feasibility Study for Serbia-Montenegro, key to starting talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
In other news, the Montenegrin government announced Friday that it has abandoned plans to build a dam and a hydroelectric power plant in the picturesque Tara gorge.
The decision came after months of demonstrations and warnings by UN officials.
Europe's longest and deepest canyon, which is on the UN World Heritage list, would have been partly flooded by the project.

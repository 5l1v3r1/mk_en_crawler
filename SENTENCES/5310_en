With an unspoiled coastline, clean water, medieval castles and Illyrian ruins, Albania has much to offer visitors, yet its potential as a holiday destination remains largely untapped.
The government is trying to change that through promotional campaigns and greater attention to tourism infrastructure.
The timing could not be more urgent, as Albania needs new sources of income to keep its economy going.
If the efforts succeed, there is hope that increased revenues from a burgeoning tourism sector will help offset the financial woes caused by the global recession.

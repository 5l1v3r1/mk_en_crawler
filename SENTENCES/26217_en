THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj was adjourned until further notice due to health problems of four remaining witnesses, the UN war crimes tribunal announced on Wednesday (March 17th).
Prosecutors had hoped to wrap up their questioning by the end of this month.
Seselj is charged with committing war crimes against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.
In other news Wednesday, Serbian prosecutors dropped treason charges against former Yugoslav People's Army General Vlado Trifunovic and four other officers.
Trifunovic had been accused by Slobodan Milosevic's regime because he abandoned an army base in the Croatian town of Varazdin early in the 1991-1995 conflict, to save the lives of his soldiers there.

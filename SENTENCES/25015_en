ATHENS, Greece -- About 500 protesters gathered outside of parliament in Athens' central square Friday evening (August 28th) to demand that forests be better protected from fires.
Wearing black clothes and carrying burnt tree branches, participants in the demonstration, which was organised by bloggers, voiced their anger against the destruction of an estimated 22,000 hectares of forests and agricultural lands by fires that blazed from August 22-25th.
They insisted that the government recruit more fire-fighters and change the contracts of those currently working on a temporary basis in the summer season to permanent labour agreements.

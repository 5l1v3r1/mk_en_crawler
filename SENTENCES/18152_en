BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) could be resumed after Serbia's elections next month, provided the new cabinet demonstrates its determination to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal, EU security chief Javier Solana's said on Thursday (December 14th) after meeting with Serbian President Boris Tadic.
The Serbian president said that war crimes co-operation would be the top priority.
After his meeting with Tadic, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said full co-operation remains the condition for resuming SAA talks, which were frozen in May.
On Friday, meanwhile, UN tribunal Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte submits her latest report to the UN Security Council on Serbia's level of co-operation.
It is expected to be negative, as Ratko Mladic and other fugitives remain at large.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The last prime minister of former federal Yugoslavia appeared before the international war crimes tribunal on Thursday (23 October).
Ante Markovic testified that he had direct knowledge of an agreement between Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman on dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He said the two leaders had told him on separate occasions that they had met in the hunting retreat of Karadjordjevo in Serbia in 1991 to work out the deal.
Other witnesses had told the tribunal about rumours of such a deal, but none before Markovic had any personal knowledge of it.
Markovic, a Croat, served as prime minister from 1989 to 1991.
Because of security concerns, his appearance before the tribunal was not pre-announced.

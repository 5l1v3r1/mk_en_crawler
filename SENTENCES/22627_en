SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb police official Vinko Kondic pleaded not guilty Monday (April 7th) to charges of genocide and other war crimes, before the BiH Court. 
Prosecutors say Kondic, a police chief in the town of Kljuc, ordered the arrest and torture of at least 30 Croat war refugees. 
He also had command responsibility for the arrest of 1,161 Bosniaks in 1992 who were sent to a prison camp, as well as the murder of 219 other Bosniaks during the course of that year. 
His case is among those transferred by the UN war crimes tribunal to the BiH judiciary.

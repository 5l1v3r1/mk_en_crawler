Fitch Ratings affirmed Serbia's credit rating at BB- with a stable outlook, giving a positive assessment to GDP growth and the ongoing privatisation process. 
On the negative side, it noted rising inflation and the large current account deficit. 
Fitch also said political risks were placing a significant constraint on the ratings, citing the Kosovo status issue, the Montenegrin independence referendum, problems in Serbia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, and the Kostunica administration's uncertain capacity to implement reforms.

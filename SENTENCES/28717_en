BELGRADE, Serbia -- The remains of over 50 people were discovered on Wednesday (August 11th) in a lake between Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia, where investigators are searching for victims of the 1992-1995 conflict.
The discovery at Lake Perucac is part of an ongoing investigation by BiH's International Commission for Missing Persons.
Experts believe most of the bodies date back to a spring 1992 massacre in the town of Visegrad, when more than 1,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by Serb forces.

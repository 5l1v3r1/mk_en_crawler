ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday (September 24th) rejected the idea of allowing schoolchildren to be taught in Kurdish.
Education in Turkey can only be conducted in Turkish, Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling Justice and Development Party, rejecting a demand by pro-Kurdish politicians.
At the same time, he noted that special Kurdish language courses are allowed.
The main pro-Kurdish political formation, the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), has urged its supporters to stage a week-long boycott of the academic year as part of a campaign to introduce education in Kurdish.
BDP leader Selahattin Demiras said Thursday that following the approval of constitutional amendments by referendum on September 12th, further changes to the constitution should be made to meet Kurdish demands for autonomy and wider linguistic rights.

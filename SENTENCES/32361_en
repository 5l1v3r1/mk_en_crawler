ATHENS, Greece -- The hijacker of a Turkish airliner surrendered to the police in Athens early Saturday (29 March) following a conversation over the phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The suspect, identified as Ozgur Gencaslan, 19, told the crew during Friday night's flight from Istanbul to Ankara that he had explosives strapped to his body.
He ordered the pilots to refuel in Athens and to continue to Germany.
The hijacker was later described as a disturbed individual who had spent many years in Germany before returning to Turkey.
Police found no explosives on him.
The Turkish government has asked for his extradition.
In other news Saturday, the Turkish Parliament passed the 2003 budget after lengthy negotiations with the IMF, clearing the way for the Fund to release $1.6 billion of a $16 billion loan package.
The money was blocked in October.
The budget aims for five per cent economic growth and a drop in inflation to 20 per cent by the end of the year.

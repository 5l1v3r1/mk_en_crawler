SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The international community in Macedonia is praising the formal launch of the decentralisation process on 1 July, stressing its importance to the country's democratisation and Euro-Atlantic integration. 
The statement, issued jointly by the EU, NATO, OSCE and US ambassadors to Skopje, called for full transparency in the transfer of responsibilities from state to local government authorities.
On Monday (4 July), the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE demanded that the government form a special headquarters for decentralisation. 
The party wants staff members to include representatives of the political parties and the mayors, in order to tackle problems stemming from the process.
In other news, Interior Minister Ljubomir Mihajlovski has described the security situation in the country as stable. 
In a report to parliament's committee for defence and security, covering the first half of the year, Mihajlovski said the crime rate declined by 30 per cent to 40 per cent, compared to the same period last year.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's top tourism official resigned on Tuesday (1 August), frustrated that bad roads and untrained staff working in outdated hotels were deterring foreign tourists.
Ovidiu Iuliu Marian, head of the National Tourism Agency, submitted his resignation after his agency published a study criticising the tourism industry as uncompetitive, compared to other countries in the region.
He said he was unable to make changes aimed at strengthening tourism, which attracts more than 6 million visitors annually, but has been in steady decline.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Assembly elected Socialist leader Sergey Stanishev prime minister by a majority of just one vote late on Wednesday (27 July), but rejected his proposed candidates for ministers and changes to the structure of the cabinet.
In an unprecedented development, Stanishev took the oath of office only to discover a few hours later that his government was rejected and that he would lose the mandate handed to him by President Georgi Parvanov a week ago.
The Socialists dropped plans to form a cabinet Wednesday, clearing the way for Parvanov to give the mandate to the ruling Simeon II National Movement, which came in second in the 25 June parliamentary elections.
Bulgaria is due to become a member of the EU in 2007, but must carry out a series of reforms to meet the entry requirements.
Analysts say the country's bid might be delayed if the political deadlock forces Bulgarians back to the polls for new elections.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The crisis affecting Serbia's ruling coalition deepened on Thursday (March 6th) as coalition members clashed over the country's EU future and Kosovo's independence.
A majority of cabinet members criticised a resolution proposed by the main opposition Serbian Radical Party, which would freeze EU integration talks unless Brussels recognises Belgrade's sovereignty over Kosovo.
However, ministers from Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia and its partner New Serbia backed it.
After the government forwarded this information to parliament, Speaker Oliver Dulic said a previously suspended session regarding the matter would resume in a week.

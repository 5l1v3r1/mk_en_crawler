SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski implied a possible change in the official government position on the border demarcation issue with Kosovo, following a meeting with Kosovo counterpart Bajram Kosumi in Pristina on Monday (13 June).
Local media reported that Buckovski suggested that regulating the border with Kosovo could take place after there is clarity regarding the status of the province.
"At this moment, we have to acknowledge that due to lacking international recognition of [Kosovo's] legitimacy, Pristina cannot be our partner in the border demarcation", said Buckovski.
He added that after the legitimacy problem is settled, the procedure would likely be completed very quickly.
Also Monday, the EU donated 115 vehicles worth a total of 2.8m euros to the Macedonian border police.
Representatives of the government, the European Commission and the European Agency for Reconstruction attended the official ceremony in Skopje.
In other news, the Macedonian Transport Ministry and NATO HQ sealed a memorandum of understanding Tuesday for a 35m-euro project to rebuild infrastructure.
NATO will finance and perform construction work on roads and bridges used by forces transiting neighbouring Kosovo.

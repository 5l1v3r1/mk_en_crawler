THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- For the second time in as many weeks, the start of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's defence case has been postponed due to his health, the UN war crimes tribunal said Monday (12 July). 
Milosevic, who was due to open his defence Wednesday against charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Balkans in the 1990s, has been told to rest to lower his blood pressure. 
"Clearly he is not well enough to start on Wednesday," said a spokesman for the tribunal. 
The trial is now scheduled to resume on 19 July.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Abdullah Gul, the deputy chairman of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), received a mandate to form a cabinet on Saturday (16 November). 
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Gul said his first task would be to address the country's economic problems. 
He also promised to work for Turkey's accession to the EU and to resolve the Cyprus question. 
He said it could be settled in time for the EU summit in Copenhagen next month, adding that Cyprus could be considered for membership then. 
That runs contrary to the view of AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who insisted Saturday that Turkey and a reunified Cyprus be admitted to the EU simultaneously.

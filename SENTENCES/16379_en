BELGRADE, Serbia -- The special prosecutor's office for organised crime issued an indictment Thursday (October 12th) against suspended Belgrade commerical court president Goran Kljajevic and 34 other people.
The 200-page indictment, the longest ever filed by Serbian prosecutors, details connections to the so-called bankruptcy mafia.
The indictees allegedly drove a number of companies into bankruptcy, defrauding the state and shareholders of millions of dollars.

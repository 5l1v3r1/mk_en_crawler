SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The United States expects progress in BiH police and constitutional reforms within weeks, Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Rosemary Di Carlo said in a videoconference with BiH media on Wednesday (June 6th). 
Di Carlo stressed the importance of these reforms for the country and the public. 
She called on politicians to resume talks and reach a compromise by the next session of the Peace Implementation Council. 
She cautioned that unless BiH advances in these fields, it would lag behind the rest of the region.

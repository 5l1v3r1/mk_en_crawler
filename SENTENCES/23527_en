BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two Israeli gynaecologists were arrested in Romania on Tuesday (July 28th) for suspected involvement in a growing trafficking scandal. 
"They are charged with human egg-cells trafficking, involvement in a criminal group and practicing medicine without permission," announced Codrut Olaru, chief prosecutor of the Department for Fighting Organised Crime. 
The two were banned from leaving the country last week, when another Israeli and his son, who managed the Sabyc clinic in Bucharest, were detained. 
Prosecutors say the suspects contacted Romanian women between the ages of 18 and 30 and paid them up to 238 euros for their egg-cells, which were then sold to couples seeking in-vitro. 
Most of the clinic's clients came from Israel, Italy and Great Britain.

OHRID, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski is meeting with his Serbian counterpart, Boris Tadic, in Ohrid on Friday (10 June).
Tadic arrived on Thursday and watched the filming of a movie that is being co-produced regionally.
During an informal meeting with Tadic that day, Crvenkovski said he hoped similar co-operation would be extended in other areas, such as sports and science.
The agenda of Friday's talks includes economic, political and regional ties, as well as the fight against organised crime.

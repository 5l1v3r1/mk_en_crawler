THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who surrendered voluntarily to the UN war crimes tribunal in March, has reportedly asked the tribunal to grant him a provisional release until the start of his trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
His lawyers cited UNMIK's preparedness to issue guarantees for Haradinaj and presented letters by Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, Parliamentary Speaker Nedzhat Daci and Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci.
In other news, UNMIK officials announced Saturday (23 April) that seven of the nine identified bodies found in a mass grave in Klina, central Kosovo, are the remains of local Serbs from Orahovec, missing since 1998. 
Remains of 21 victims have been discovered on the site thus far, according to UNMIK.

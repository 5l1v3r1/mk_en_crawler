SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A survey conducted by Transparency International BiH (TIBH) suggests much of the public perceives bureaucracy as corrupt.
TIBH presented the results at a news conference in Sarajevo on Friday (17 September).
Officials said 55 per cent of those polled believe there is corruption in the BiH government, 58 per cent in the entity governments and 52 per cent in the BiH presidency.
Political parties are also considered corrupt:
cited in particular were the nationalist Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and the Serb Democratic Party.
According to TIBH, the results were not very different from a similar survey conducted last year.
In other news Friday, the World Bank board reviewed a new Country Assistance Strategy for BiH, envisioning between $100m and $180m for projects over the next three years.
The financing will be used mainly to strengthen the country's economic performance and reduce its dependence on foreign aid.

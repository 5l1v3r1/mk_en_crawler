TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) has appealed to the responsible institutions in Albania to get on with the investigation of the Gerdec explosions that killed 26 people three years ago. 
EC spokesperson Natasha Butler said on Thursday (March 17th) that the judiciary must shed light on the munitions depot explosions and punish those responsible. 
The process is not flowing as expected, Butler commented. 
About 30 officials were implicated in the dismantling process and contracts, but none is serving time.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The head of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ) parliamentary group, Luka Bebic, said Monday (26 July) that he believes local elections would likely be called in April 2005.
That would seem to contradict reports that the presidential and local elections would be held simultaneously.
By law, the presidential election must take place by the end of January, when incumbent Stipe Mesic's term ends.
Local media continue to report that many HDZ officials support the idea of both elections taking place at the same time.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government reached an agreement with associations of labour unions and employers late Friday (25 April) on a set of amendments to a proposed labour act.
The tripartite social council is expected to meet again by the end of the month or early next month to sign a final agreement on the legislative reform.
Parliament will start debate on the package in late May or early June.
The purpose of the amendments is to liberalise the labour market and improve productivity and competitiveness.
Employers said the proposed reforms may lead to increased layoffs in the short run but will ultimately pay off through more competitive job openings.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US Ambassador to BiH, Clifford Bond, said in an interview with Onasa news agency that the Orao arms trading scandal could not be resolved until political responsibility is established for the violations of the UN embargo on Iraq.
Bond said the United States expected the full report on the case to be completed by 3 January, as requested by the international community's High Representative, Paddy Ashdown.

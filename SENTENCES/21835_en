BUCHAREST, Romania -- Unresolved conflicts in the Black Sea area are the region's flashpoint and can reignite at any time, Romanian President Traian Basescu warned on Wednesday (October 22nd), in a speech to a security conference in the Black Sea resort of Constanta.
"Our biggest fears in terms of regional security were confirmed this summer.
The shield of democracy was not enough to protect one of the countries in the region, Georgia, from secession," Basescu said.
He stressed one lesson from Georgia is that state territorial integrity and border inviolability must remain an essential component of international law.
He insisted the Black Sea area needs a stronger NATO and EU presence to maintain stability.

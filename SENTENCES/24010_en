TIRANA, Albania -- The country is expected to submit its application for EU candidate status by the end of the month, European Commission (EC) spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy confirmed on Thursday (April 16th).
She said the EU's Czech presidency set the application date in consultation with the Albanian government.
"The EC has regular contacts with potential candidates like Albania, and the issue of application has been discussed several times in the last month.
However, it is up to the Czech presidency to set a specific date for the application," Nagy said.
She reiterated that holding fair and transparent general elections in June is crucial for Albania's application.
Lawmakers from the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) boycotted a session of parliament Thursday to protest alleged violations in the process of issuing new electronic ID cards.
Voters will need to show a card or a passport before casting a ballot on June 28th.
The SP members say they won't return to parliament until the government makes the process more comprehensive and starts issuing the ID cards for free.
The government dismissed the move as political grandstanding and pledged to complete the issuing process in the main cities by the end of the month.

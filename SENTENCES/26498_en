SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov called a press conference Friday (March 12th), at which he condemned the impeachment procedure initiated against him by the ruling Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party. 
At issue is Parvanov's decision to tape a discussion he was having with Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov earlier this month, without informing Dyankov that it was being recorded. 
GERB says that violation of the law is an impeachable offence. 
Parvanov told reporters Friday that such conflict between institutions will only thwart efforts to address larger issues. 
He criticised some of the economic policies of the GERB-led cabinet and seemed at one point to suggest that Dyankov should resign, implying the length of Bulgaria's crisis will be directly related to the length of Dyankov's tenure.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The campaign promoting the principles of the US-Adriatic Charter wrapped up Friday (9 April) with an international conference in Skopje attended by Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler.
The campaign included roundtable discussions held around the country, intended to acquaint the public with the goals of the Charter and to boost public support for the initiative.
The Adriatic Charter was signed by Macedonia, Albania, Croatia and the United States and is aimed at co-ordinating efforts related to eventual NATO membership.
In other news, the State Electoral Commission said on Saturday that it had received no complaints regarding this week's presidential election.
VMRO-DPMNE candidate Sasko Kedev and DPA candidate Zudi Xhelili had charged that the list of voters is inflated with fraudulent names.

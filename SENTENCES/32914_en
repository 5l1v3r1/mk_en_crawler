BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said Saturday (28 June) that former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic should surrender and follow the example of former Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving a prison term after pleading guilty before the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
Batic urged all indictees to surrender and help boost Serbia's image in the eyes of the international community.
On Sunday, meanwhile, Batic announced there is still no agreement on the new Serbian Constitution.
It is scheduled for completion and approval by the end of the year.

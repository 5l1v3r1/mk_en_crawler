BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic vowed on Wednesday (August 19th) that police will protect participants in Belgrade's Gay Pride parade scheduled for September 20th. 
"In this country, no one will be allowed to threaten or bother anyone," Dacic said, adding police will do their best to guarantee public order and safety. 
Parade organisers welcomed Dacic's commitment. 
Anti-gay graffiti has appeared in Belgrade ahead of the event and several groups have warned they will interrupt it. 
Several people were severely beaten during the 2001 Gay Pride march.

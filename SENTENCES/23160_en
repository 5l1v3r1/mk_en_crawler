PARIS, France -- The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will be the focus of a meeting of EU foreign ministers that takes place in Brussels on November 10th, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and High Representative Miroslav Lajcak announced after a meeting in Paris on Friday (October 31st). 
"Reforms in BiH have slowed down, despite commitments from all political parties to ensure fast progress on the EU agenda," Lajcak said after the meeting. 
He and Kouchner agreed that no party should be allowed to ruin the progress reached in BiH's EU accession efforts over the past 13 years. 
They also urged BiH's leaders to work harder in their bid to fulfil the objectives set by the Peace Implementation Council in February.
Meanwhile, Dayton Peace Accord architect Richard Holbrooke said on Thursday that there is more tension and less co-operation between the entities in BiH now than at any other time since the 1992-1995 conflict. 
He told Reuters that the key reason is Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik. 
He also said that allowing one of BiH's entities to call itself "republika" was a mistake. 
"We should have insisted on a different name," Holbrooke said.

TIRANA, Albania -- Outgoing OSCE Ambassador to Albania Robert Bosch will present the annual report on Albania's progress to the permanent council in Vienna on Thursday (September 9th).
Bosch stresses in the document that judicial independence remains a challenge.
Combating corruption is an area where the country has made gains via new anti-corruption laws, according to the document.
Political conflicts in Albania comprise a significant part of the report.
Bosch stresses that the opposition Socialist Party's parliamentary boycott has stagnated the work of the institution, particularly in terms of adopting crucial laws needed for reforms.

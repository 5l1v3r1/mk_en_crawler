BUCHAREST, Romania â Primary opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana met with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Wednesday (February 13th) and demanded parliamentary elections be moved up to the same day as local elections.
Geoana insists that early elections are the only way to resolve the current political stalemate between Tariceanu and President Traian Basescu.
But the idea has little traction, even within Geoana's own party.
Honorary PSD President Ion Iliescu said Geoana "mixed things up a little bit as the PSD is not ready for elections".
Local elections are due in the first half of this year, while parliamentary elections are to be held at end of the year.

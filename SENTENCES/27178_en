PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia would only be possible if Serbia recognises Kosovo's independence, the government said on Wednesday (March 3rd). 
Following a cabinet meeting, spokesman Memli Krasniqi said there will never be talks on Kosovo's status, as independence is irreversible. 
Krasniqi pointed out that technical dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade can happen only when political authorities in Belgrade accepting the reality of an independent Kosovo. 
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner had suggested talks between Pristina and Belgrade during his visit to Kosovo earlier in the week.

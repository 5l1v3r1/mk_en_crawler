ATHENS, Greece -- Police said on Monday (January 5th) that a weapon used to shoot a young policeman in central Athens led investigators to the leftist terror group Revolutionary Struggle. 
Early Monday, gunmen opened fire on riot policemen, seriously wounding one of them. 
Tests showed Revolutionary Struggle had used one gun in April 2007 to attack a police station, police said. 
The extremist group emerged after police dismantled the leftist terror group November 17 in 2002. 
Revolutionary Struggle also claimed responsibility for an attack on the US Embassy in Athens in January 2007. 
Monday's attack raised fears of a resurgence of leftist terrorism, although there was no immediate claim of responsibility.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic on Wednesday (9 February) refuted a statement made earlier the same day by Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) Police Director Zlatko Miletic, who said war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic had been in Serbia since the summer of 2004. 
Miletic claimed Karadzic and Mladic were under the direct protection of members of the Serbian government. 
Jocic denied that either indictee had been on Serbian territory.

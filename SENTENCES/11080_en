BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A new sub-group investigating the 1995 Srebrenica massacre was formed in Republika Srpska (RS) on Wednesday (27 July) at the request of High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The chairman is Smail Cekic, who heads the BiH institute for researching crimes against humanity and international law.
The new body will act as part of the government's existing Srebrenica Commission, working to establish the truth about the massacre.
Ashdown had demanded the sub-panel's formation, criticising the slow pace of the Srebrenica probe and the lack of sufficient information from Banja Luka.
The new sub-group is to scrutinise all RS institutional archives, and compile a list of those responsible for the massacre as soon as possible.

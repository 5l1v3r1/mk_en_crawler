MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- Kosovo's status will be a main topic of discussion during talks Tuesday (May 15th) between visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. 
Speaking to reporters Monday, Rice said that while Russian and Serbian concerns should be taken into account, the settlement process should not be delayed.
Separately Monday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov said Russia's vision differs from the draft resolution on Kosovo submitted by the United States and other Western partners at the UN Security Council. 
Moscow has indicated it may veto the document.
Also Monday, the EU General Affairs Council extended the mandate of the EU Planning Team (EUPT) for Kosovo, from June 1st to September 1st. 
EUPT, which succeeds UNMIK, will work on a possible EU crisis management operation after the UN Security Council vote.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Mervan Gul, of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), resigned from parliament Monday (6 January), clearing the way for AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to win his seat and eventually become prime minister.
Gul says he has no plans to run in the by-election in the province of Siirt, where he was originally elected.
AKP will be the only party allowed to take part in the vote, as no other party managed to meet the required threshold.
Erdogan launched a trip to Central Asia on Tuesday, hoping to drum up trade in three former Soviet republics.
His trip will also take him to China.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has wrapped up a trip to the Middle East, meeting in Jordan Monday with King Abdullah.
Afterwards, he called again for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Iraq.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH House of Representatives again postponed the debate on electing a new Croat member of the BiH presidency.
The process was expected to begin Thursday (21 April).
The seat was left empty in late March when High Representative Paddy Ashdown removed Dragan Covic from the post, after he was charged with corruption stemming from earlier government service.
Parliament Speaker Sefik Dzaferovic said the debate was delayed because no party, including the main Croat party, HDZ, had nominated anyone to the post.
He added that the chairmanship of the Lower House is giving the parties two more weeks to settle the issue.

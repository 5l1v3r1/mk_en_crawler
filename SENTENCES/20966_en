SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A state of emergency was declared in northern Bulgaria on Thursday (January 3rd) after heavy snowstorms during the past two days blanketed the area with up to 3m of snow. 
An estimated 300 municipalities were without electricity. 
Drinking water was cut off to 31 other localities. 
While deep snowdrifts delayed several trains, flights were cancelled at the Sofia Airport. 
Varna Airport closed all day.
Neighbouring Romania was hard hit, as well. 
In Bucharest, Mayor Adriean Videanu asked residents to help clear a half-meter of snow from streets and urged them to use public transportation rather than attempt to drive and park. 
Bucharest's two main airports were closed on Thursday, stranding thousands of passengers.

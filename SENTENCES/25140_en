PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government adopted draft answers to the European Commission (EC) questionnaire on Thursday (November 26th).
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic will likely deliver the final version to Brussels early next month.
Based on Podgorica's responses to more than 2,100 questions, the EU will assess its readiness for membership.
Montenegro hopes to obtain candidate status next year and launch accession talks by 2011.

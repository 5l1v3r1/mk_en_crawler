ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament elected secularist Koksal Toptan, 64, as its speaker Thursday (August 9th).
He had served as education and culture minister in previous governments before joining the ruling Justice and Development Party.
Analysts say his quick election should accelerate the process of choosing a new Turkish president.
The ten-day nomination process could be completed by August 20th.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is considered the frontrunner.
In other news Thursday, Turkish Airlines workers voted to begin a strike after their demands for better pay were not met.
But the government has the authority to postpone strikes in key sectors, including the airline industry, as a walkout could have a devastating impact on tourism.

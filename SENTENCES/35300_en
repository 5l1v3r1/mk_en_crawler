ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told parliament Tuesday (17 February) that resolving the division of Cyprus is linked to Turkey's EU membership bid. 
Describing negotiations now under way in New York, Gul said UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan for reunification would not work if Turkey is not on the road to Union membership.
In other developments, EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen dismissed the possibility of granting Turkey a special partnership with the Union in lieu of full membership. 
German opposition Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel suggested the special partnership during a meeting Monday in Ankara.
Also Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with his Swedish counterpart, Goran Persson, who expressed Sweden's support for Turkey's EU membership bid. 
He commended the government and legislature for their efforts to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria.

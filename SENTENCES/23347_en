SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Labour Minister Emilia Maslarova announced on Sunday (March 29th) that her ministry intends to restrict the domestic labour market for non-EU citizens in a bid to reduce unemployment, which observers expect to soar amid signs of much slower economic growth.
The measure will mostly affect sector quotas for professionals in areas that have seen insufficient demand.
Those most affected will be from neighbouring Macedonia, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Vietnam, which saw talks last year about importing workers for construction because of a lack of local personnel.

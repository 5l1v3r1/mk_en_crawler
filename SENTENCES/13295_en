NEW YORK, United States -- Kosovo is not making enough progress in meeting an international set of human rights standards, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a report to the Security Council on Thursday (26 January).
"I am seriously concerned that there have been delays or setbacks in most areas of standards implementation," he said.
Annan blamed Kosovo's politicians and leaders as well as the Serb community in the province.
In other news, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged Kosovo's politicians to hold a presidential election as soon as possible.
He said that that "people with a sense of responsibility" must fill the vacuum left by Ibrahim Rugova's death Saturday.

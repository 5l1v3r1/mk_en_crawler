ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor vowed on Wednesday (May 4th) continued co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
She met in Zagreb with tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz, ahead of his report to the UN Security Council next month. 
Brammertz's assessment of Croatia's co-operation with the court is essential to close the judiciary chapter in negotiations with the EU.
About 30 war veterans staged a protest against Brammertz's visit, criticising last month's ICTY verdicts convicting generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac of war crimes stemming from the 1995 military operation Storm. 
They were sentenced to 24 and 18 years in prison respectively.
In other news Wednesday, police arrested 22 border policemen and customs officers for suspected corruption at the border with Slovenia. 
The anti-corruption office USKOK suspects they were part of an organised group that took bribes in return for waving imports through without collecting duties.

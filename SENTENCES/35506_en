ANKARA, Turkey -- Council of Europe Secretary General Walter Schwimmer paid a short visit to Ankara on Thursday (10 June) and said he believes Turkey will be removed from the monitoring process in a vote to be held later this month. 
The EU body has monitored human rights issues in Turkey since 1996. 
He said that ending the process would clearly signal the EU's intention of launching accession negotiations with Turkey. 
Schwimmer also praised the release from prison of four former Kurdish members of parliament this week.

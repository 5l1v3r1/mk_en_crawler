SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The scandal at the interior ministry deepened on Tuesday (March 25th), as the prosecutor's office arrested Ilia Iliev, chief secretary of the ministry up until the end of last year. 
Iliev was forced to resign last year due to a scandal involving a Serbian mobster who obtained Bulgarian identity documents that allowed him to travel freely in EU countries. 
At the time, Iliev claimed the man was given the documents only in order to nab his associates. 
He eventually resigned because of that explanation.
His arrest Tuesday stemmed from new information linking him to the deputy director of the interior ministry's anti-organised crime squad, Ivan Ivanov. 
The latter was arrested recently for tipping alcohol producers about ongoing VAT and excise tax fraud investigations.
Despite the scandal, the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party said on Tuesday it is standing by Interior Minster Rumen Petkov, who himself has not been accused of any crime.

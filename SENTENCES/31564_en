BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Sources say former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic left for The Hague via Geneva on Monday morning (20 January), to face charges stemming from the 1999 war in Kosovo.
Belgrade authorities have been under growing international pressure to hand him over.
Meanwhile, the United States reportedly has again threatened to suspend aid to Yugoslavia unless the government steps up war crimes co-operation efforts.
Belgrade-based B92 radio reported Sunday that Washington issued a statement calling on both Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to arrest and hand over the war crimes indictees.

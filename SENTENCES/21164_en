MADRID, Spain -- On the eve of UN envoy Matthew Nimetz's visits to Athens and Skopje this week, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said Washington wants Macedonia to be very cautious in its name dispute with Greece.
He met on Thursday (November 29th) with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis on the sidelines of the OSCE ministerial session in Madrid.
Afterwards, Burns called on the government in Skopje to demonstrate greater sensitivity to Greek public opinion, while urging Greece to realise that some of its actions are "very provocative".
Nimetz visits the two capitals on Tuesday and Wednesday.

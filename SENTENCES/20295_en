SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's six ruling coalition parties will resume constitutional reform talks at the end of January in Brussels, Croatian Democratic Union 1990 (HDZ 1990) leader Bozo Ljubic said on Thursday (December 13th). 
He added this was agreed upon at a recent meeting party leaders held with High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. 
The two main Croat parties, the HDZ and HDZ 1990, submitted a joint proposal for a new federal-style structure to other party leaders earlier this week.

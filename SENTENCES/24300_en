NICOSIA, Cyprus -- US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Saturday (April 11th) extended an invitation to Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou to meet her in Washington on April 20th.
Earlier in the day, Clinton invited Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to a meeting on April 15th.
Cypriot media commented on Saturday that Kyprianou's invitation came in an effort to placate Nicosia, since Talat will visit the United States only days ahead of the April 19th parliamentary elections in the northern part of the divided island.
Meanwhile, the UN expressed satisfaction on Friday with the progress of the renowned reunification talks between the two communities in Cyprus.
UN spokesperson Alexander Downer said the talks between Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat had seen real progress and described this fact as "very encouraging".

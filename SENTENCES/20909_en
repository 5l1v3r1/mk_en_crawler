WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. 
Bush meets with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday (November 5th) to discuss how to curb attacks on Turkey by Kurdish terrorists based in northern Iraq. 
The session is viewed by many as a last chance to avert the threat of a Turkish military operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases in Iraq. 
"We have run out of patience with the terrorist attacks being staged from northern Iraq," Erdogan said at the weekend, adding that he expects concrete measures from the United States. 
He described the matter as a "serious test" of relations between the two NATO allies.
His visit may mark the end of diplomatic efforts aimed at containing the PKK. 
These efforts were the focus of an international conference Saturday in Istanbul, featuring officials from Iraq, Turkey, the US and Iran.
In other news, Turkish and Kurdish immigrants held peaceful rallies across Germany to protest developments on the Iraqi-Turkish border. 
Sunday's demonstrations in Munich, Dortmund, Berlin, and other cities included an estimated 10,000 immigrants.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A move is under way in both houses of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Parliament to remove Niko Lozancic as FBiH president. 
Political parties, including Lozancic's own Croatian Democratic Union, accuse him of poor communication between the legislature and the presidency, and of delaying many reforms due to his negligence of presidential duties.
In the other BiH entity, Republika Srpska, new Interior Minister Stanislav Cado held a news conference Tuesday. 
He said his priorities include the continuation of police reform in BiH, combating organised crime, corruption and terrorism, and boosting co-operation with The Hague tribunal.

TIRANA, Albania -- The country's main opposition Socialist Party (SP) will not participate in the local elections this winter unless the parliamentary majority complies with its demands for electoral reform, SP leader Edi Rama said on Thursday (17 August).
The party has raised objections to a temporary voters' register and the ruling party's selection of a Central Election Commission member.
Rama said that if the majority does not compromise regarding these matters, the SP and its four partners in the left-wing opposition coalition would seek early general elections in 2007.

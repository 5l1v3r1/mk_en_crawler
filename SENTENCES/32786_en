WASHINGTON, United States -- Recep Tayip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, will meet US President George W Bush and other senior officials on Tuesday (10 December).
Bush is seeking Turkish support for a potential military strike against neighbouring Iraq, and Erdogan needs US support for a date to start accession talks with the EU, whichbegins its summit Thursday in Copenhagen.
Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis told a local newspaper Monday that his government could accept a delay of six months in the announcement of a start date, suggesting the spring of 2004 as the most likely date.
But President Ahmet Necdet Sezer sounded a different note Monday, telling the media that he would not be travelling to Copenhagen for the summit.
He described it as a test of the Union's sincerity towards his country.
"I believe they will not be very successful at this test," he said.
Reuters and AFP are reporting that several EU foreign ministers support a French-German proposal that sets 2005 as the conditional date for starting accession talks with Turkey.

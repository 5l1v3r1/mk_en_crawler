BERLIN, Germany -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the CeBIT software and communications technology fair in Hanover on Monday (February 28th), as Turkey is a partner nation in the event this year. 
In his speech, Erdogan urged Berlin to ease visa restrictions for Turkish nationals, to facilitate businessmen visiting the EU. 
Merkel said she backs a review of current restrictions on business visas to allow travel on shorter notice. 
Currently, Turkish businessmen need to apply weeks in advance for visas to Germany. 
Erdogan also stressed the importance of Turkey's EU membership in light of the unrest spreading in the Arab world. 
"Turkey can communicate with East and West and with North and South. 
Turkey is a country that really knows its neighbours," Erdogan said. 
Merkel, whose country is known for its opposition to Turkey's accession, did not address its EU ambitions.
Erdogan was due to visit Brussels on Tuesday, but returned instead to Istanbul for the funeral of Necmettin Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist prime minister.

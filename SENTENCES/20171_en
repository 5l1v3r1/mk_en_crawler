NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mehmet Ali Talat, has sent a letter to Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos accepting his invitation for a meeting, local media reported on Wednesday (August 15th). 
About a month ago, Papadopoulos had invited Talat to discuss implementation of last year's so-called July 8th Accord, which envisions restarting talks between the two sides of the divided island regarding smaller, quality of life issues. 
After receiving Talat's response, Papadopoulos immediately sent a letter to the top UN envoy for Cyprus, Michael Moller, who will arrange the details of the meeting.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Two people -- one Turk and one Dutch -- were injured when a bomb exploded at a cafÃ© in Istanbul on Saturday (23 July).
The Dutch tourist was reported to be in serious condition following the explosion near the Galata Bridge, in a neighbourhood frequented by tourists.
The explosion was caused either by a remote-controlled bomb or a bomb on a timer, according to the police.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities suspect it may be part of the recent Kurdistan Workers Party campaign against tourist destinations.
A bomb blast in the sea resort of Kusadasi last week killed five people.

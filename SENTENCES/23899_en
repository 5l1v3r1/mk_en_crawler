BELGRADE, Serbia -- The G17 Plus will mobilise its voters and run alone in the next elections, deputy caucus head Vlajko Senic told Blic on Monday (July 20th).
In May 2008, G17 Plus was part of the Democratic Party (DS)-led coalition For European Serbia.
Voters were rather divided then, choosing between nationalists and pro-EU parties.
The G17 Plus and the DS have supported democracy and have participated in a coalition throughout several election cycles and governments.
Nevertheless, recent announcements from both parties suggest relations have deteriorated in the past few months, although both deny any split in their ruling coalition.
Last week however, the DS signed a preliminary co-operation memorandum with two of the coalition partiers -- the Serbian Socialist Party and the Sandzak Democratic Party, and said they would not invite G17 Plus to join for the time being.

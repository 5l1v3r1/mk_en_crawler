NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias warned on Monday (January 12th) that despite intensive efforts, no real progress has resulted in the ongoing reunification talks between the two communities on the divided island. 
After four months of work, "a number of secondary issues have been agreed upon, but significant differences still remain regarding the issues of powers and functions [of the future central government], the system of governance and foreign relations," he said.
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met on Monday for the 15th round of direct talks since negotiations began in September. 
The two plan to meet again on Friday.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Friday (October 15th) relieved Kosovo Police Director Behar Selimi, from duty at the suggestion of Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi.
No reason was given for the decision, but media reports suggest it was provoked by Selimi's recent statements that he would quit the police to engage in politics.

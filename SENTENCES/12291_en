THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Hague tribunal unsealed the indictment Friday (8 April) against former Bosnian Serb Captain Milorad Trbic, who is charged with crimes against humanity stemming from the Srebrenica massacre. 
The charges were revealed a day after Trbic, 47, was extradited to The Hague, but it is not clear whether he surrendered or was arrested. 
Late last month, Trbic was named in the same indictment as former Zvornik brigade commander Vinko Pandurevic. 
According to prosecutors, Trbic assisted in the planning and preparation of the 1995 massacre. 
His first appearance before the tribunal judges is scheduled for Wednesday.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliament on Wednesday (September 1st) met the last condition for EU visa liberalisation after the House of People extended the mandate of Mijo Kresic as head of the Anti-Corruption Agency.
Tanja Fajon, European Parliament (EP) rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, said that the process of visa liberalisation for BiH and Albania could be accelerated if the report by European Commission experts on the countries' progress is positive.
It is to be submitted to an EP committee for discussions Thursday.
BiH lawmakers also approved a decision to send 45 troops to Afghanistan.
The soldiers will leave in October.
BiH currently has ten officers serving within the International Security Assistance Force mission.

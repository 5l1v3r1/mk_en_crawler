BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO will not start the planned second phase of downsizing its peacekeepers' mission once the first phase is completed, Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Thursday (June 10th) in Brussels.
He told a meeting of NATO defence ministers that the Alliance "will not undertake any step which would risk Kosovo's security".
NATO downsized its troops in Kosovo from about 14,000 to 10,000 in January.
In other news Thursday, the German parliament approved extending the mandate of German KFOR troops by another year.
There was extensive debate before the vote however, during which lawmakers criticised the Kosovo government for failing to attract foreign investment, due to the weak rule of law.
Currently, 1,500 German troops are involved in the training of Kosovo Security Force staff, though about half of them are scheduled to leave Kosovo by year's end.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The office of Prime Minister Adrian Nastase issued a statement Monday (21 October) welcoming the results of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice. 
The government calls it a clear sign that EU members will accelerate the enlargement process. 
Nastase added that the vote increases Romania's chances to enter the EU in 2007. 
By the end of the year, the EU Council is expected to approve a road map for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. 
Romania, however, must still streamline its economic reforms in order to meet accession criteria for a functioning market economy. 
A recent progress report by the European Commission noted that Romania was the only official candidate that has not met those criteria.

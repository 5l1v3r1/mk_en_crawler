PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament voted Thursday (18 December) to adopt a law on co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi said the law would prevent "arbitrary prosecutions" and would bring the province closer to Euro-Atlantic integration.
Kosovo Serbs voted against the law, saying Kosovo Albanians were trying to limit co-operation to crimes committed during the bombing of Yugoslavia.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Three frigates of NATO's Standing Naval Force Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED) arrived in Istanbul on Thursday (14 August). 
According to information provided by STANAVFORMED Commander Adm Philip Wirth, the naval force is one of the NATO rapid deployment forces created after the 11 September attacks in the United States. 
During the five-day stay, the frigates will be used to help prevent terrorist activity and stem illegal immigration into the country by sharing intelligence with the coast guard.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Thursday (24 April), Deputy Prime Minister and acting Co-ordinator on Kosovo Nebojsa Covic called for a dialogue with Kosovo Albanians.
His proposal aims to resolve the most pressing problems in the province without touching the issue of Kosovo's status.
He acknowledged that, in order to launch talks, Belgrade "would have to tell the Albanians that they really did suffer under Milosevic, although the Serbs weren't any better off".

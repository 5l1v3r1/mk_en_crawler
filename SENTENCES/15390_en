TIRANA, Albania -- At a roundtable discussion Thursday (27 July), President Alfred Moisiu warned that Albania cannot hold local elections this winter with the existing Electoral Code or its current electoral infrastructure. 
He called on all political parties to hammer out a compromise so the parliamentary commission on electoral reform could resume its work. 
He described progress over the last seven months as nearly invisible, and urged that the recommendations of OSCE/ODIHR be taken into consideration.
In other news Thursday, parliament unanimously ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Albania and the EU. 
The accord, sealed on 12 June, spells out the political and economic criteria Albania must meet in the EU integration process.

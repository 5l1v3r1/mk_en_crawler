BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) will freeze 500m euros' worth of financing to Bulgaria due to the government's inability to properly address widespread corruption, Reuters reported on Saturday (May 24th). 
The agency cited a source within the EC who reported Commission concern that the EU is being defrauded.
For Romania, which joined the EU in January 2007 with Bulgaria, the EC reportedly will extend a warning about corruption but will not suspend financing.

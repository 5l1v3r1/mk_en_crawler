ZAGREB, Croatia -- Interpol has issued a red notice -- or wanted decree -- for former Serb militia commander Dragan Vasiljkovic, who is being sought by Australian police and Croatian authorities, local media reported Thursday (April 8th).
The Australian High Court approved his extradition to Croatia late last month, but authorities have been unable to locate him.
Vasiljkovic, known as Captain Dragan, is accused by Zagreb of being involved in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993.

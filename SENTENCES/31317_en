ATHENS, Greece -- Athens University rector Theodosis Pelegrinis was summoned for questioning by prosecutors Monday (January 31st) after more than 250 illegal immigrants occupied the law faculty of the university last week and launched a hunger strike. 
Pelegrinis is accused of failing to perform his duties. 
Seven other people have also been called to testify. 
The immigrants are demanding legal residence status. 
After police managed to get them off campus they moved to a building in central Athens where they continue their hunger strike.

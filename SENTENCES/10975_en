PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said Wednesday (30 March) that Belgrade has signaled a new willingness for dialogue with the Kosovo interim government.
Meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, Jessen-Petersen discussed his recent visit to Belgrade, saying the Serbian authorities realise that only dialogue concerning the province's final status would contribute to the positive development of processes in the region.
Also Wednesday, Jessen-Petersen visited a centre for displaced persons in the southern Serbian town of Bujanovac, home to over 300 Serbs and Roma refugees from Kosovo.
He urged them to return to the province, stressing that the return process is a major prerequisite for progress.

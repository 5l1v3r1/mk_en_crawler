ATHENS, Greece -- Voters went to the polls Sunday (October 4th) in snap general elections that the ruling New Democracy (ND) conservatives may regret.
Polls suggest that the opposition socialist PASOK party, headed by George Papandreou, leads Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis's ND by about 7%.
Karamanlis asked for the vote early last month, about half-way through his term, saying he wants a new mandate to deal with the country's economic troubles.
His government has been bruised by a series of corruption scandals.
Opponents say he has failed to deal with corruption in state institutions and to modernise the country.
Papandreou has promised to build a green economy and invite foreign experts to help Greece overcome its problems.
Meanwhile, a small homemade bomb exploded late Friday in a trash bin, not far from where a final campaign rally for Karamanlis was to take place in downtown Athens.
No injuries were reported because a caller phoned in warnings about ten minutes before the bomb went off.

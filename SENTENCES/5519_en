The Sarajevo Film Festival (SFF), a unique platform for co-operation in Europe, was established especially for the film industry in Southeast Europe (SEE), organisers say.
The programme's diversity educates young filmmakers about the world of cinematography, and opens doors to the European and International Network of Movie Industry.
The festival also serves as a forum to initiate and discuss projects with colleagues from the region.
For many producers, the festival is an opportunity to find new talent, story ideas and projects to invest in.
The main goal of the SFF is to highlight talented filmmakers and promote future projects from the region to draw international media attention, organisers said.

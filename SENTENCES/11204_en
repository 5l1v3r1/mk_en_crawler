ZAGREB, Croatia -- Roman Catholics and Protestants in Southeast European (SEE) countries celebrated Easter Sunday (27 March).
The holiday is being widely observed in Croatia, where Catholics make up nearly 88 per cent of the population, as well as in Croat areas of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In a special address, Zagreb Archbishop Cardinal Josip Bozanic extended a message of peace, happiness and reconciliation to all believers.
In Albania, President Alfred Moisiu sent a message to Monsignor Rrok Mirdita, Archbishop of Durres and Tirana.
"The tradition of co-existence and religious harmony, which is old but continuous to date, is an asset which Albanians will preserve â€¦ in order to be a factor of peace in the region and move forward on the irrevocable road of integration," he said.

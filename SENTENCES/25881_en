TIRANA, Albania -- Rapporteur for Albania Tanja Fajon said the European Parliament (EP) will be briefed on Tirana's EU visa liberalisation process next month. 
As for the political stalemate that has slowed EU-related reforms, Fajon urged the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party on Sunday (March 21st) to stop damaging Albania's image. 
The stalemate stems from elections nine months ago that the Socialists say were manipulated.

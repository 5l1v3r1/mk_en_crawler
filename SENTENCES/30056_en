PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Authorities have extended the population census in some municipalities until Tuesday (April 19th), the Statistical Institute has announced.
The process, which began on April 1st, was due to be completed on Friday but was extended to give people more opportunity to participate.
Preliminary census results are expected in June.
About 1.6 million people have been registered so far, though Serbs living in the north are boycotting the process.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak announced on Tuesday (January 8th) that he has extended by six months the mandate of Peter Nicholl as chairman of the Indirect Taxation Authority's Governing Board. 
Nicholl's mandate was due to expire next week, but the ruling coalition parties have so far failed to agree on a successor.

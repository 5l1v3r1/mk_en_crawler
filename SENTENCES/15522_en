PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR has stepped up patrols across the province, in order to prevent possible violence as the Kosovo status settlement process reaches its final phase.
KFOR spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Walter-Hubert Schmidt indicated on Friday (22 September) that the stepped up patrols were also in response to recent incidents that have strained interethnic relations in Kosovo.
In the latest, two Serbs were injured Friday after they were attacked by a group of ethnic Albanians in the eastern village of Osojane.
Meanwhile, UN police in Kosovo say they arrested seven ethnic Albanians, suspected of involvement in the March 2004 ethnic riots that killed 19 Serbs.
No other details were released.

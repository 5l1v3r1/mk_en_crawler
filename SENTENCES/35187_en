LUXEMBOURG -- The EU Council of Ministers, during a meeting on Monday (26 April), welcomed the European Commission's (EC) recently released positive avis on Croatia.
However, the ministers postponed issuing an opinion on Croatia until their next meeting in June, just ahead of the EC summit.
Croatia's candidate status is to be decided on then.
The UK and Italy are insisting on the arrest of war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina.
In other news, Bulgaria and Croatia signed an agreement to co-operate in the EU integration process.
It stipulates joint efforts by the foreign and European integration ministries, as well as on the parliamentary level.

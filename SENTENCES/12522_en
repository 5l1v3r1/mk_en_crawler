THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The three judges in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic ruled Tuesday (7 December) that the defendant's court-appointed lawyers must remain on the case.
Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins, both from Britain, had asked the court to dismiss them because Milosevic has refused to communicate with them.
In other news, former Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic pleaded not guilty before the UN tribunal on Tuesday.
He was the commander of the Serb forces that laid siege to Sarajevo in 1995, when some of the worst shelling of the city occurred.

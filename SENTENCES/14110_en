SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry said on Wednesday (15 March) that an internal investigation has proved police did not abuse their power during a 2 March operation in Kondovo, during which one man was killed and one injured.
The case sparked strong reaction from the ethnic Albanian population in the area.
Officers had been sent to Kondovo with a court order to arrest three suspects.
Investigators say the suspects fired at the officers, forcing them to fire in self-defence.

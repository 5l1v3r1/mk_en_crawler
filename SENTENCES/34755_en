ATHENS, Greece -- A powerful earthquake struck islands in western Greece on Thursday (14 August), toppling lampposts, sending roof tiles and boulders tumbling and touching off a panicked exodus of residents and tourists toward the mainland.
At least 24 injuries were reported, three of them serious.
The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.4, occurred at 8:15 a.m.
about 20 miles off the Ionian Sea island of Lefkada, said the Athens Geodynamic Institute.
Its epicenter was about six miles under the seabed.
It was followed four hours later by a strong aftershock with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3.
People raced into the streets and some frightened tourists sought to leave the islands -- a potential economic blow during a peak holiday week.
The bridge linking Lefkada to the mainland was clogged with cars heading out.

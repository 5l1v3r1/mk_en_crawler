THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A court in The Hague began hearings Wednesday (June 18th) on a claim against the Netherlands and the UN filed on behalf of about 6,000 relatives of victims of the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
They accuse the UN and the Netherlands of failing to prevent the massacre, which began after Bosnian Serb forces seized the Muslim enclave.
The Bosnian Serb forces ultimately killed an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys and deported thousands of women and children.
The Hague war crimes tribunal has already recognised the Srebrenica massacre as genocide.
At the time, the enclave was a UN security zone under Dutch peacekeepers' protection.
But after the Serbs seized Srebrenica, the peacekeepers allegedly failed to take measures to protect the local population and did not allow local staff to remain in the area.
Relatives of the victims are seeking at least $4m in compensation.

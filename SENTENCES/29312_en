TIRANA, Albania -- The government adopted the 2011 budget Wednesday (November 3rd), the largest in the country's history.
Road infrastructure will get the most capital investments, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said, adding that new salary and pension increases will be enforced next year, ranging between 5% and 10%.
The majority has the votes needed to pass the bill in parliament, but it must first undergo discussion by parliamentary panels.

Speaking at an annual meeting with youth of the party, Meta said the country has changed from an exodus point to a country moving closer to European integration.

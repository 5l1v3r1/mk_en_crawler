BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government adopted new legislation Monday (April 26th) spelling out the authority of the National Integrity Agency (ANI). 
The ANI's powers were considerably reduced recently by a Constitutional Court ruling that banned the agency from inspecting the validity of asset statements filed by senior officials and from seizing assets illegally acquired. 
According to the new provisions, asset statements will be audited by the ANAF, the state revenue collection agency, which already has such powers. 
Furthermore, if irregularities are found, cases will be forwarded to the prosecutor's office, which will decide whether assets will be seized. 
In addition, there will be two sets of statements, one public and one confidential. 
The public one would contain only general data on holdings.

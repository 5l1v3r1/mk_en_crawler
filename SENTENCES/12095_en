ANKARA, Turkey -- Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin paid a brief visit to Ankara on Saturday (15 January) for talks on promoting co-operation in the energy sector.
He was on his way to tsunami-affected areas in Thailand when he met Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler at the airport.
According to Guler, Canada has offered to invest in hydroelectric and coal power plants.
The Canadian company AECL also is seen as a likely contender in upcoming bidding for the right to build three nuclear plants in Turkey.
In other news, two soldiers and five leftist militants were killed in a clash in eastern Turkey on Saturday.
Media reports suggest the militants were members of the outlawed Maoist Communist Party.

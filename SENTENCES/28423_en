PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Most political entities participating in the December 12th snap elections pledged on Monday (November 15th) to conduct a fair race, as a precondition for free and democratic elections. 
Invited by acting President Jakup Krasniqi, party representatives signed a Code of Conduct. 
"We want the final result of the December 12th elections to be the will of the Kosovo people and not a manipulated will of Kosovo people," Krasniqi said. 
Political parties also promised not to influence the work of the Central Election Commission and to respect the election results. 
International representatives welcomed the initiative, saying Kosovo needs an election process that meets the highest international standards.
The Vetevendosje movement refused to sign the agreement, saying that it "does not trust the political parties" and does not want to be part of a "formal masquerade".

NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian President Boris Tadic on Wednesday (September 24th) called on Macedonia not to recognise Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence.
After meeting with Macedonian counterpart Branko Crvenkovski on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York, Tadic said Belgrade would undertake "corresponding measures", should Skopje proceed with recognition.
Crvenkovski said he believes that when deciding on Kosovo, the government would consider "all pros and cons".
In related news, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told Crvenkovski on Wednesday that recognition of Kosovo's independence by Skopje would have a positive impact on bilateral relations and regional stability.
The government in Skopje will consider Kosovo's arguments and its state interests before deciding on recognition, Crvenkovski said.
He also stressed the importance of completing the border demarcation process between the two countries and sought assurances that Kosovo recognises Macedonia's constitutional name.
Also Wednesday in New York, Albanian President Bamir Topi said Kosovo deserves to become a UN member as soon as possible.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Topi noted any political, economic, military or diplomatic effort against Kosovo's consolidation as a state "would be a hopeless attempt against its EU integration".

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Senior officials from Belgrade and Pristina met in the Belgian capital on Sunday (October 14th) for a new round of talks on Kosovo's future. 
Both sides briefed each other on their respective positions. 
The EU issued a statement afterwards explaining that members of the Belgrade delegation had provided further details on their plan for far-reaching autonomy of the province.
For their part, the Pristina delegation explained their plan for a friendship treaty between an independent Kosovo and Serbia. 
Wolfgang Ischinger, a member of the Contact Group troika mediating the talks, urged both sides to speed up the negotiations as "there is quite a distance to be covered" before the December 10th deadline for completing the process.

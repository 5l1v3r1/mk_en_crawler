SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of NATO, the OSCE, the EU and the United States issued a joint statement Friday (30 May), voicing full support for efforts to bring to justice those responsible for a mining incident near Sopot in early March that killed two NATO soldiers and two civilians. 
The statement was in response to reports that local residents in the former crisis region had threatened both the Macedonian police and members of the EU Force, if ethnic Albanians detained as suspects in the case were not immediately released. 
The western diplomats called on local residents to co-operate with security forces, while urging police to fully respect human rights standards.

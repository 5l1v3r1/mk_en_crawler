THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has lodged an appeal against the start of his trial before The Hague war crimes tribunal, news agencies reported on Monday (September 28th). 
Karadzic says he will not have enough time to prepare his defence ahead of the proposed October 19th date. 
Earlier this month, Hague tribunal Judge O-Gon Kwon dismissed Karadzic's request for a ten-month delay. 
He is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

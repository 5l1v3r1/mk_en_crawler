SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Lawmakers passed an anti-discrimination law Thursday (April 8th) by a vote of 62-1.
Representatives of the opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) had walked out the session to protest what they described as an "anti-European law".
However, the bill does not include discrimination based on sexual orientation, as was requested by Brussels.

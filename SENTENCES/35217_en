SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov paid a surprise visit to Iraq Sunday (25 April), just two days after a Bulgarian soldier was killed in Karbala.
He visited the Bulgarian base and held talks with the command of the Polish-led division that controls the area.
Parvanov and Chief of Army General Staff Nikola Kolev also met with US Administrator Paul Bremer and General Ricardo Sanchez, commander of the Coalition's land forces in Iraq.
Parvanov reiterated Bulgaria's resolve to remain a member of the international coalition, but sought extra security measures for his troops.
The danger was immediately apparent, as Parvanov's motorcade came under fire while he travelled between the Bulgarian and Polish bases.
No injuries were reported.

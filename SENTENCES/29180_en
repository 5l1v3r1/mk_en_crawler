ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Sunday (September 5th) that in the upcoming local elections, voters will say "yes to the future and to the changes that would turn Greece into a different, better and fairer country".
The vote on November 7th will be the first electoral challenge for the PASOK government, which came to power in October 2009.
"We will win the test of local elections.
We see no dilemma over cutting ties with mistakes of the past," Papandreou told the National Council of PASOK, which held a pre-election gathering in Athens.
He added that his party will support former Citizen Solicitor George Kaminis for the mayoral race in Athens against incumbent Nikitas Kaklamanis.
Current Deputy Minister of Economy, Shipping and Competitiveness Markos Bolaris will run for head of the Central Macedonia region in northern Greece.
In Thessaloniki, PASOK will support local winemaker Yiannis Boutaris.

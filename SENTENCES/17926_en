SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Though it might be asked to contribute more troops to international peacekeeping missions, Chairman of the BiH Joint Chiefs of Staff Lieutenant General Sifet Podzic says it is unrealistic to deploy more.
Speaking on Saturday (April 14th), he cited the limited defence budget and the ongoing restructuring process in the army.
Presently BiH has peacekeeping units in Iraq, Congo and Eritrea.
In other news, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling reiterated on Friday that the deal on police restructuring was very nearly accepted by key leaders last month.
He stressed this is an opportunity that should not be missed.
The restructuring is key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

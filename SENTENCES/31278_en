ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (February 1st) called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to end his 30-year rule amid mass protests in Cairo. 
"Mr. 
Mubarak, all of us will die and will be questioned over what we left behind," Erdogan told members of his Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
"Listen to the shouting of the people, the extremely humane demands. 
Without hesitation, satisfy the people's desire for change," he said.
Erdogan added that he is cancelling a visit to Egypt planned for next week but will reschedule when the situation returns to normal. 
Mubarak said in a televised speech late Tuesday that he will not run for another mandate in the September elections, but insisted he should stay in his post until then.

ATHENS, Greece -- About 1,045 employees of the state-run Greek National Statistical Office continued their two-month walkout Friday (28 November).
The strike could jeopardise talks between employers and labour unions.
Nikos Analytis, negotiation leader at the Federation of Greek Industries, said employers would use August's projected figures for inflation of 3.6 per cent in negotiating wages for next year.
In other news, Olympic Airways cancelled 25 flights on Friday and was poised for more cancellations on Saturday when cabin staff walked out of their jobs.
Flight attendants are protesting pay cuts within the framework of the government's effort to trim the company's losses before selling it to private investors.
A local court ruled the strike illegal.

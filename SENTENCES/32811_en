SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government plans to reduce the term of required military service from nine to six months, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Thursday (5 December). 
Parliament is expected to approve the decision in January. 
Military service would be further trimmed to only two months in the beginning of 2007 as part of a government effort to move from a conscript to a professional army. 
By then, Buckovski added, Skopje should be able to accumulate 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the funds necessary to employ professional soldiers.

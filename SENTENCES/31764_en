ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Tuesday (7 January), the Split-based Centre for Democratic Development (CERD) condemned the recent refusal of the Croatian Constitutional Court to rule on problems related to tenancy rights. 
The NGO warned of human rights violations, mainly in the case of Serb nationals who had lost their tenancy rights for more than six months. 
CERD forwarded a request for interpretation of the court's stance to all parliamentary benches, the justice ministry, the OSCE and the EU. 
The document suggests that tenancy rights should be considered a part of the rights guaranteed by the constitution.

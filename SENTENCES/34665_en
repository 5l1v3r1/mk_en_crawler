ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and the United States have reportedly reached agreement on sending Turkish peacekeeping troops to Iraq. 
The local NTV news channel reported on Thursday (21 August) that Washington initially requested 16,000 troops, but negotiations had brought the number down to 10,000. 
However, the number reportedly could rise again, depending on developments in Iraq. 
The National Security Council meets Friday to discuss the issue, followed by a cabinet meeting Monday. 
Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul says the government's decision will be based on ongoing technical and military assessments.

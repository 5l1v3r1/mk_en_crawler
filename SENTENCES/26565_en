TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha told a cabinet meeting Wednesday (February 10th) that a special investigative commission will be set up to identify all victims murdered by the communist regime.
The commission's responsibilities will be to locate and identify those believed to have been executed between 1946 and 1991.
Earlier this week, a mass grave containing 19 suspected "enemies of the regime" was found in the outskirts of Tirana by a man searching for the body of his father, who disappeared in 1976.
The Association of Former Victims of Political Prosecution estimates that about 4,000 such people are still missing.

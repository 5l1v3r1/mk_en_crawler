SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police have detained Velija Ramkovski, owner of the private A1 TV channel, and several executives for suspected tax evasion, abuse of office and money laundering, media reported on Friday (December 24th). 
An investigative judge remanded 14 of the suspects to 30 days in custody, including Ramkovski and A1 Director Aneta Kociski. 
Police are searching for Ramkovskis's son and four other people. 
Late last month, agents investigating financial crimes, accompanied by police officers, inspected the financial records of six companies registered at the same address as A1 TV. 
The audit was conducted as part of a fraud investigation. 
Some media are reporting that Ramkovski is suspected of evading 4 million euros in taxes since 2005.

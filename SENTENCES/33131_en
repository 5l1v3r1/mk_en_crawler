BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO stands ready to speed up the process of accepting Serbia into the Partnership for Peace programme, according to a delegation of Alliance officials who visited Belgrade on Thursday (15 May). 
Talks with government officials focused on further co-operation in military reform, especially in terms of adopting civilian command legislation and working more closely with European parliaments. 
Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said, however, that there is no point in even applying for Partnership for Peace membership until local authorities apprehend and hand over war crimes suspect Veselin Sljivancanin, the only of the so-called "Vukovar Three" still at large. 
A second alleged member, Miroslav Radic, was extradited by Serbia on Saturday. 
The third, Gen Mile Mrksic, surrendered to the UN tribunal last year.

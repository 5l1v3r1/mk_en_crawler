BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Wednesday (March 17th) said he would consider seeking financial assistance from the IMF if necessary.
"If we find we have to take credits from the financial markets under extremely high interests to finance the Greek debt, we will look into all options," Papandreou told a press conference with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels.
However, he pointed out, Athens prefers an EU solution.
Barroso said he already sees a change in Greece's dire economic situation, compared to just a few weeks ago, thanks to government efforts.
In Berlin on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament there should be a mechanism to expel eurozone members that consistently break its financial rules.
She reiterated that Germany plans no "rash" financial help for Greece, and said there is no alternative to the Greek austerity plan.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia agreed Thursday (23 January) on the distribution of seats in the future joint parliament.
Under the terms of the new constitutional charter, Serbia and Montenegro are to appoint their representatives to the joint legislature of the common state.
Serbia will be entitled to 91 out of 126 seats in the legislature.
The Serbian Parliament is expected to vote on both the new constitutional charter and the law on its implementation next Tuesday.
Votes in the Montenegrin Parliament, originally scheduled for Thursday, will likely be held instead that same day.

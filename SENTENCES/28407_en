TIRANA, Albania -- Supporters of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) clashed with police in the outskirts of the southeast city of Korca on Wednesday (May 12th).
It happened as a cordon of police tried to stop a protest from taking place, claiming it was illegal and that the protestors had no right to block the roadway.
SP lawmakers on the scene said police used tear gas to disperse the crowd.
The SP and their supporters have attempted to spread protests across the country, which in many cases has led to violence.
The SP is demanding ballot boxes from the June 2009 general elections be opened, to confirm alleged fraud.

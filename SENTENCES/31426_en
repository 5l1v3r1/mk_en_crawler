BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Serbian Parliament approved the constitution of the future union with Montenegro on Monday (27 January). 
The vote was 166 to 47. 
President Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia opposed the accompanying implementation bill, arguing that it opens the way for Montenegro's independence. 
It passed with the support of 130 legislators. 
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic lobbied hard, saying the EU-brokered deal was far from perfect, but was the best arrangement for now. 
Montenegro's Parliament is expected to adopt the new constitution on Tuesday. 
It becomes law when it is approved by the federal assembly in Belgrade. 
The new looser union will be called Serbia and Montenegro.
Adoption of the new constitution is a condition of membership in the Council of Europe. 
In Strasbourg on Monday, Peter Schieder, chairman of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly, suggested membership could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting in late March. 
Traditionally, membership is the step before a country starts accession negotiations with the EU.

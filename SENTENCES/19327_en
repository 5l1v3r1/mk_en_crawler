SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Serb man found guilty of war crimes has been sentenced to 28 years in prison, the special war crimes court in Sarajevo announced on Wednesday (November 28th). 
Jadranko Palija, 46, shot and killed five civilians captured near the town of Sanski Most in May 1992. 
In addition, he and other militiamen attempted to execute 14 detainees by ordering them to jump from a bridge and opening fire at them. 
No one was killed in that incident.
Palija, who was also convicted of raping a female prisoner at gunpoint, served as a military police officer in the Bosnian Serb army from 1993 to 1995.

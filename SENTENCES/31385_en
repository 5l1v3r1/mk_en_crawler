ANKARA, Turkey -- The State Security Court delayed its verdict Friday (25 April) in the controversial retrial of four former Turkish Parliament members of Kurdish origin who were jailed nine years ago for alleged separatist activities.
The court also denied a defence motion to bring in defence witnesses and to ban certain prosecution witnesses from testifying.
In 2001, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the trial of the Kurds was unjust, since defence witnesses were not questioned.
But the retrial was delayed until just last month, awaiting adoption of related laws.
European human rights monitors are watching the retrial closely.

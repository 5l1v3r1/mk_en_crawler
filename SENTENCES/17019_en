PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- After their regular weekly meeting on Thursday (November 2nd), UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker and Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku again warned against any delay in resolving Kosovo's final status. 
The two insisted a solution should be found by the end of the year, as scheduled. 
Ruecker added he is certain that this deadline would be met. 
The two also talked about transferring jurisdictions to the Kosovo institutions and about UNMIK's quarterly report, which is to be submitted to the UN Security Council at the beginning of December.
On Friday, Ceku is visiting Montenegro for talks with counterpart Milo Djukanovic.

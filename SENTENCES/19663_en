LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- EU defence ministers agreed on Thursday (February 21st) that international peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo can handle any unrest that might arise over Kosovo's decision to break from Serbia. 
At an informal meeting in Slovenia, the ministers also indicated they would be ready to increase the 2,500-member EUFOR in BiH if separatist efforts intensify but stressed there is no such need at present. 
"The good news is that from the security point of view, Bosnia has remained very stable, very unaffected by developments in Kosovo," said Lieutenant General David Leakey, director general of the EU's military staff.
Shortly before arriving for the meeting, German Foreign Minister Franz Josef Jung visited Pristina, where he announced his country is recognising Kosovo's independence. 
He also vowed that Germany would help Kosovo protect its territorial integrity.

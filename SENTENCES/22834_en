ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis announced on Tuesday (October 7th) that the ruling New Democracy (ND) parliamentary group allowed expelled lawmaker Stavros Dailakis back into its ranks.
Last week, the ND expelled Dailakis over his criticism of senior party officials.
In a TV interview, he had asked for government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos' resignation over his alleged involvement in corruption scandals.
Later, Dailakis apologised for his statement and asked for reinstatement.

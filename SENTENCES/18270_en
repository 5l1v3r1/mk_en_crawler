BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders are not likely to heed Italy's call for the resumption of talks with Serbia, when they meet later this week. 
Prime Minister Romano Prodi sent a letter to his counterparts in the EU, suggesting that the Union should encourage Belgrade's European aspirations and open negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, even though Ratko Mladic and other war crimes fugitives remain at large. 
Jan Kohout, Czech ambassador to the EU, said on Tuesday that a number of countries oppose such a move, making its adoption unlikely.

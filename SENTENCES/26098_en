SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Associations of war victims voiced disappointment and outrage Tuesday (September 15th) over The Hague tribunal's decision to release former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic early from prison.
Plavsic is serving an 11-year sentence in a Swedish prison for her role in war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 conflict.
"How could Plavsic have the right to freedom and I do not have the right to find and bury the bones of my son, 14 years after he had been brutally killed," said Munira Subasic, head of an association of survivors of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Several NGOs representing war victims and war camp prisoners plan a protest Wednesday in Sarajevo.
The tribunal announced on Tuesday that Plavsic will be released after serving two-thirds of her sentence.
Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says he plans to visit her in prison Wednesday.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Thursday (August 7th) summoned parliamentary parties to discuss the judiciary's current status, the recent European Commission (EC) report on justice, and National Anti-corruption Department head Daniel Morar's mandate. 
Talks are scheduled for Tuesday, the same day when Morar's current mandate expires. 
According to the president, the shared goal is to achieve an end to EC monitoring by July 2009. 
He said it is key that the EC report in December is a positive one.

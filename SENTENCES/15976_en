TIRANA, Albania -- The Western Balkans are crucial for Europe's security, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said Friday (November 17th), urging states in the region to step up their co-operation in the fight against drug and human trafficking.
Strengthening the rule of law, the judicial system and security within Western Balkan countries is also essential, he added.
Frattini was speaking at the fourth EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs, held in Tirana.
Discussions at the forum focused on measures for enhancing the region's border control system, measures against organised crime and terrorism, and witness protection.
The event was attended by ministers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Finland, which now holds the rotating EU Presidency.

TIRANA, Albania -- A delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which is in Tirana to help end the country's political stalemate, met with Prime Minister Sali Berisha and opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama at President Bamir Topi's office Monday (February 22nd).
Topi is working to mediate talks between the government and the opposition, whose lawmakers vow to continue boycotting parliament until an investigation is opened into the June 2009 general elections.
On Monday, the PACE delegation also met with Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli.
Topi's office says talks will continue Tuesday, followed by a press conference.
Berisha praised PACE's contribution and said the government is ready to implement the delegation's recommendations, adding he is prepared to establish a commission to look into the transparency of the June elections.

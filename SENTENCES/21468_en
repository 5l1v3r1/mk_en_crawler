BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's Anti-Corruption Prosecutor Office (DNA) asked parliament's lower house Thursday (April 24th) to approve the launch of an official investigation against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.
He faces charges of taking bribes and forging official documents in connection with acquiring his current home, worth an estimated 1.5m euros.
President Traian Basescu already has approved the investigation, which also implicated former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea.
Parliament is expected to discuss the DNA request on May 5th.
Investigations have dogged Nastase since he left office in 2006.

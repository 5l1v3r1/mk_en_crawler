SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ninth anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement is being marked on Monday (22 November). 
The accord, which halted the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH, was endorsed by the then presidents of BiH, Croatia and Serbia -- Alija Izetbegovic, Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic -- following long negotiations at the US military base in Dayton, Ohio. 
The formal signing took place weeks later in Paris. 
High Representative Paddy Ashdown has recently said certain changes might be necessary to better meet new realities in the country.

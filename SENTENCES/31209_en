TIRANA, Albania -- A wave of Albanian immigrants returning from celebrating New Year with their families overcrowded land border checkpoints with Greece on Monday (January 3rd).
Police said that they provided more officers to deal with the influx but reports suggest Greece was slow to deal with the situation.
An estimated 22,000 immigrants have headed to the borders of Kakavija and Kapshtica for the last 24 hours.
About 70,000 immigrants entered Albania before the holidays through the Kapshtica checkpoint alone.
Police expect the wave of immigrants returning to Greece to increase in the coming days.

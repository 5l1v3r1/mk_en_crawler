SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the BiH Directorate for EU Integration, Osman Topcagic, presented in Sarajevo Tuesday (13 December) a manual for harmonising BiH legislation with that of the EU.
At a news conference with European Commission Ambassador Michael Humphreys, Topcagic said the manual would provide practical and useful guidelines for BiH legal experts, civil servants and politicians in the process of EU accession.
To harmonise laws quickly, BiH must adopt between 100 and 150 laws and amendments per month.
In other news, the BiH Civil Affairs Ministry announced on Tuesday that the task force working on a state-level bill on higher education finally has completed the full text of the draft.
The draft goes next to the government for approval.

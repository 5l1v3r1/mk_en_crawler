LISBON, Portugal -- Greece staged one of the biggest upsets in football history Sunday (4 July), winning the European Championship with a 1-0 victory over Portugal.
Angelos Charisteas headed in the winning goal in the 57th minute after a corner kick.
A strong defence prevented the heavily favoured Portuguese side from staging a comeback.
Greece started the tournament as the clear underdog.
In mid-June, its odds of winning the title were 80:1.
Millions of people took to the streets across Greece Sunday night, setting off fireworks and singing the national anthem.
Even police officers in security-conscious downtown Athens were seen dancing in Omonia Square.
The party spread across the world as Greek communities in Cyprus, Germany, Canada, Australia, England and the United States celebrated their nation's biggest sports victory.

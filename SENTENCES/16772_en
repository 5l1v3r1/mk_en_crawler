BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The commander of NATO HQ in BiH, Brigadier General Louis W. Weber, says the country has made progress in fighting terrorism and organised crime.
In an interview in Monday's (8 May) edition of Nezavisne novine, Weber noted that one of the main tasks of NATO, EUFOR and other international organisations is to assist in the establishment of BiH's own capacities to address such problems.
According to Weber, domestic authorities are handling terror-related issues well.
As for top war crimes suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, Weber reiterated that he was unaware of their current locations.
If there was information, NATO would have responded, he said.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The trial of four Bosnian Serb officials accused of organised crime and embezzlement -- Mirko Sarovic, Momcilo Mandic, Milorad Govedarica and Milovan "Cicko"Bjelica -- is scheduled to begin before the BiH Court on Tuesday (18 April). 
The four were indicted in relation to a bank affair at Privredna Banka Srpsko Sarajevo in 1998. 
Separately, Mandic also faces charges of document forgery and helping war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic avoid arrest.
In other news, the Trebinje Public Security Centre announced on Sunday that seven people were detained in relation to recent bomb blasts in the Bosnian Serb town. 
Two weeks ago, separate bombings destroyed the cars of a local police officer and the son of a local judge.

TIRANA, Albania -- More than a month after the vote, Socialist incumbent Edi Rama was pronounced the winner of Tirana's mayoral election. 
The Albanian Election Commission announced Friday (14 November) that he won 58 per cent of the vote. 
His nearest rival, Democrat Spartak Ngjela, received 38 per cent. 
Squabbles between the ruling Socialists and the opposition Democrats delayed the results. 
The OSCE warned that such delays undermined the credibility of the elections.

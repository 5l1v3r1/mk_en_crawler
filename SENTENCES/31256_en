TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian authorities and US diplomats inaugurated on Tuesday (March 1st) a US-sponsored taxpayers' centre that is expected to serve half of the businesses operating in the country.
USAID earlier supported a project to implement an electronic system in public procurement and a project introducing a one-stop-shop system in business registration.
US Ambassador Alexander Arvizu said the new centre is an example of co-operation with the Albanian government in reforming the public administration that improves the business climate and boosts the fight against financial crime and corruption.

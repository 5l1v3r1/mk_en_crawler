ATHENS, Greece -- Starting Tuesday (1 August), employees of the Emporiki Bank plan a two-day protest against the planned sale of the state's 40 per cent stake in the bank to France's Credit Agricole.
The workers' unions are arguing that Emporiki should remain under Greek control.
Credit Agricole is the sole candidate buyer in the tender for privatisation.
Last week it presented its final buyout bid, offering to pay 3.3 billion euros for the stake, up from 3.1 billion euros.

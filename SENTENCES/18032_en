ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed his commitment to secularism and democracy Tuesday (May 15th) in a speech to participants of the International Press Institute World Congress and 56th General Assembly in Istanbul.
Erdogan insisted that he remains loyal to the country's secular laws and rejected accusations his government might try to increase role of Islam in the everyday life.
"It would be a mistake to pit secularism against Islam," he said, adding that some are using this debate to score political points.
In the past four years, Erdogan said, the party has made significant progress in modernising the economy and legal system.
He also reaffirmed the country's determination to pursue EU integration.

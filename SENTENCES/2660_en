Erduan Iseni won the special election in Skopje's Suto Orizari municipality on 4 September, becoming the new mayor of the largest Roma community in Europe. 
According to the Macedonian Municipal Election Commission, Iseni, the candidate of the Roma Emancipation United Party, won by a margin of only 257 votes.
During the campaign, he promised that he would improve the infrastructure, champion Roma emancipation, create conditions for better education, and improve social and health protection. 
His opponent, Shaban Saliu of the Macedonia Roma Union, made similar promises.
Iseni garnered 3,465 votes, or 51 per cent, while 3,208 voters (47 per cent) supported Saliu. 
Eighty-three ballots were judged invalid or marked incorrectly.
Out of the municipality's 19,908 eligible voters, only 6,756 -- about one third -- cast their ballots. 
The figures echoed the poor turnout in the first round, held two weeks earlier.
According to Lidija Taseva, chairperson of the Municipal Election Commission, the Macedonian Roma Union submitted objections related to the low turnout. 
However, Saliu's representatives signed off on the Commission's reports.
No irregularities in the voting process were recorded, and both the first and second rounds took place in a peaceful atmosphere, the Commission said.
The Roma Lobby Group and the NGO MOST also noted no substantial irregularities. 
The two groups had 75 people monitoring polling stations during the election.
Isolated cases of family voting and multiple votes were recorded. 
Most objections to the election process came from the candidates' staffs, who said people were bribed to vote for one candidate or the other.
A regular election was held in April. 
However, the winner of that vote, Amdi Bajrami, was unable to take office because of his conviction in a textile corruption scandal. 
He is now serving a prison sentence.

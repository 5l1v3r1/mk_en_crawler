PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Three new Serb-dominated municipalities -- Gracanica, Kllokot-Verbovc and Ranilug -- will be established after the November 15th local elections, when the Novo Brdo municipality will be expanded, International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith announced on Wednesday (September 16th). 
The decentralisation is expected to improve life in the new municipalities and address concerns of local residents. 
However, Albanians in Gjilan/Gnjilane have opposed the decentralisation and the establishment of another municipality -- in Partesh -- arguing the process serves the interests of Belgrade, in dividing Kosovo.
Meanwhile, Central Election Commission chairperson Nesrin Lushta said on Wednesday that preparations have been completed for the municipal elections to be held in Partesh and northern Mitrovica. 
They will be organised no later than six months after the November poll "based on the decision made by the Ministry of Local Government Administration".

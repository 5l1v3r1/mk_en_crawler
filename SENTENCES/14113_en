VIENNA, Austria -- Meeting on Wednesday (15 March), the political directors of the Peace Implementation Council's steering board called for agreement on crucial constitutional reforms in BiH, aimed at strengthening the state institutions.
According to a statement issued after the session, they also urged completion of the police sector restructuring, in line with accords reached in October 2005, and fulfilment of remaining obligations towards the UN war crimes tribunal.
In Washington, the US Senate passed a resolution on BiH, urging political agreement on the constitutional reforms by April, so that changes take effect prior to the October general elections.
BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic told the newspaper Dnevni avaz that negotiations would likely resume Saturday in Sarajevo.

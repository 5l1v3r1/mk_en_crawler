ANKARA, Turkey -- The Pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) began a two-day hunger strike Sunday (May 3rd) to protest last month's wave of arrests of party members in massive police operations. 
Nearly 10,000 party members, including DTP leader Ahmet Turk, lawmakers and DTP mayors, are participating in the action.
In April, police arrested dozens of DTP members, including senior officials, for suspected links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Turkey's Constitutional Court is currently deliberating a case demanding the closure of the DTP for alleged links to the PKK. 
The party holds 21 of the 550 seats in parliament.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Commander Major General Gian Marco Chiarini says he believes the situation in BiH allows for a reduction in the number of EUFOR troops there. 
In an interview in Saturday's (November 4th) edition of Dnevni avaz, Chiarini downplayed concerns expressed in both BiH and the West against the possible reduction, saying it would instead reflect real progress achieved by BiH in terms of stabilisation and security.

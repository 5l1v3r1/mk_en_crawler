SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The heads of six leading BiH parties agreed on Wednesday (19 April) to adjust some language in the draft constitutional reforms package, to make the provisions less open to interpretation. 
Top representatives of the Serb Democratic Party, Union of Independent Social Democrats and the Party of Democratic Progress, the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and Social Democratic Party, as well as the Croatian Democratic Union attended the meeting. 
Earlier this week, the government urged that some language be reworked to make it more precise. 
Agreement by these six parties guarantees adoption by parliament's House of Representatives.
Austrian President Heinz Fischer, who visited Sarajevo on Wednesday, stressed the importance of constitutional reform as a major precondition for BiH's successful development. 
Fischer, whose country currently holds the rotating EU Presidency, also praised the performance of EUFOR, saying it has contributed to peace and stability in BiH.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Friday (February 5th) charged Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj with contempt of court for revealing in a book the identity of 11 protected witnesses at his war crimes trial.
The court already had sentenced him in July 2009 to 15 months in prison for revealing the identity of three protected witnesses in one of his books, despite a court ban on disseminating such information.
The SRS leader still faces separate charges for war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Seven of Turkey's leading NGOs issued a statement Wednesday (March 26th) calling for various political parties to reduce tensions surrounding a court case aimed at banning the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
The NGOs warned in a statement distributed in 81 provinces across Turkey that the nation risks being polarised and that the ease with which political parties can be closed poses a risk to democracy. 
They urged everyone involved "to take a step back from their recent positions".

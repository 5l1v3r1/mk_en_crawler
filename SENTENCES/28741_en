ATHENS, Greece -- Former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis may establish a political party after being expelled from the New Democracy (ND) party and its parliamentary group, Ta Nea reported on Sunday (May 9th). 
Bakoyannis was booted for supporting the government's austerity plan, something other ND members voted against. 
The ND has warned that anyone who threatens party unity will be forced from its ranks.

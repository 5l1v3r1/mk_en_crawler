SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Serbian citizen wanted in connection with the murder of prominent Croatian publisher and journalist Ivo Pukanic turned himself in to police in Banja Luka late Monday (February 1st).
Bojan Guduric arrived at the police station with his lawyer.
He is in a custody pending extradition to Croatia.
Croatian authorities had offered a 14,000-euro reward for information leading to his arrest.
Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional, was killed in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb on October 23rd 2008, along with the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic.
Investigators say Guduric activated the bomb.
Four other suspects in the case go on trial Wednesday in Zagreb.

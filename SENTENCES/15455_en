SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov said on Monday (25 September) that while there has been no decision on boosting the number of Bulgarian peacekeepers in Afghanistan, participation in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) must continue.
Bliznakov was speaking to reporters in Sofia after he and Bulgarian Army chief General Zlatan Stoykov returned from a weekend visit to Afghanistan.
According to the minister, any increase in the size of Bulgaria's contingent depends on finances.
In other news, Serbia announced plans Friday to send a military doctor to Afghanistan, as part of the Norwegian ISAF contingent.
A second doctor would soon follow.
Next March, Serbia plans to send 26 military personnel and three officers, serving under Belgian command.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The EU foreign ministers are expected to instruct the European Commission (EC) on Monday (September 13th) to draft an opinion on Serbia's readiness for EU candidate status. 
Beta news agency reports that Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar is expected to make the proposal. 
Serbia has the support of almost all countries in the bloc except for The Netherlands, which still insists that Bosnian Serb wartime leader Ratko Mladic must be arrested first. 
Germany, Spain and the UK reportedly have expressed strong support for Serbia and insist the country's efforts in harmonising its resolution on Kosovo with the EU should be rewarded. 
Last week, Belgrade submitted a new resolution on Kosovo to the UN General Assembly, which was adopted unanimously. 
It was drafted after intense talks with the EU, and it calls for dialogue on practical issues.

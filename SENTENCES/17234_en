ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country may open around ten more chapters in accession negotiations with the EU in late June, according to Vincent Degert, head of the European Commission's delegation in Croatia.
He noted on Wednesday (May 30th) that that the number of opened and closed chapters is not as important as the quality of measures, implemented as result of accession negotiations.
Croatia has opened six chapters so far, two of which have been closed provisionally.

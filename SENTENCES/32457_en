BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police on Monday (17 March) said two more members of the Zemun clan have been arrested.
Dragan "Prevara" Ninkovic, described as a leader of the Zemun drug cartel, and Zoran "Vuk" Vukojevic, another alleged senior official in the organised crime group, were detained in connection with last week's assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
The deputy head of the Democratic Party, Cedomir Jovanovic, says those directly responsible for the murder would be arrested "within days".
Police raided the home of popular folk star Svetlana "Ceca" Raznatovic, the wife of slain underworld figure Arkan, as part of the operation.
The singer was arrested on suspicion of sheltering fugitives from the Zemun group.

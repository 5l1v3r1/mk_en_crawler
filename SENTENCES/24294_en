ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors charged seven suspected members of al-Qaeda on Saturday (April 11th) with belonging to a terrorist organisation and propaganda and jailed them pending their trial.
Police arrested them on Thursday in a large-scale operation in the region of the Eskisehir province in western Turkey.
Last month, Turkish media reported police had received US intelligence suggesting al-Qaeda militants could be plotting attacks on foreign targets from Turkey.

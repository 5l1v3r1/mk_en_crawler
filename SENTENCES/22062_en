WASHINGTON, United States -- Michael Braun, chief of operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, accuses the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) of involvement in drug trafficking and other international organised crime networks, Turkish media reported on Sunday (July 20th).
Organisations such as the PKK, which receive financing from drug trafficking as well as from their involvement in terrorism, could be defined as "hybrid", Braun said on Friday, during a forum on drug trafficking and Middle Eastern terrorist groups at the Washington Institute.
In other news, three German hostages whom the PKK released on Sunday are heading home, Turkish media reported on Monday.
The climbers, abducted by PKK militants on July 8th in the eastern province of Agri, arrived at an airport in eastern Turkey accompanied by a German delegation.
They are expected to fly to Ankara and then board a nonstop flight to Munich.

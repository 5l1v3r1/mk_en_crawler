PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Special Representative Pieter Feith criticised lawmakers' efforts in his report to the European Parliament on Tuesday (September 1st). 
Feith said parliament has failed in its job as a government watchdog. 
According to him, although parliament has remained committed to implementing reforms and building local institutions, it must become more involved in decision-making, as well as improve its oversight of the government's performance. 
Feith added that authorities in Kosovo need to ensure that EULEX can continue its mission under the best possible circumstances. 
As for achievements, Feith mentioned Kosovo's membership in the IMF, the World Bank, and the establishment of a Constitutional Court.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Monday (September 29th) called on the two communities in Cyprus to embrace the current opportunity to reunify the divided island. 
The recent resumption of talks offers encouraging outcomes that would be in both communities' advantage, PACE said in a draft report prepared by German parliamentarian Joachim Horster. 
It also urged both sides to adopt additional confidence-building measures aiming to increase chances for success.
Separately Monday, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said the two communities will have to jointly face the problem of water shortages on the island. 
Christofias, however, down played press reports suggesting the issue of transporting water from Turkey arose within the ongoing reunification negotiations. 
The issue did not arise officially during the talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, Christofias said before heading to Strasbourg, where he addresses PACE Tuesday.

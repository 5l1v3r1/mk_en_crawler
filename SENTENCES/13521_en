BUCHAREST, Romania -- A court on Wednesday (24 August) extended by one month the detention of Syrian businessman Omar Hayssam, suspected of involvement in the May kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq. 
The three -- Marie Jeanne Ion, Sorin Dumitru Miscoci, and Ovidiu Ohanesian -- were released after several weeks. 
The details surrounding their case have been murky from the start. 
Some say Hayssam arranged the kidnappings to deflect attention from his own legal troubles in Romania.

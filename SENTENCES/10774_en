LONDON, United Kingdom -- Western governments on Wednesday (6 October) largely welcomed the European Commission's decision to recommend the start of accession talks with Turkey. 
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw praised the move and urged EU leaders to "deliver" on their promise to Ankara when they meet at the European Council summit in December. 
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli reiterated his country's longstanding support for Turkey, noting the Bush Administration's satisfaction with Ankara's determination to implement far-reaching reforms. 
A spokesman for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Berlin would vote for the start of talks with Turkey at the December summit, while Greece -- once Turkey's greatest rival -- stressed the EC decision's importance for stability and prosperity in the Balkans. 
Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Slovakia also praised the EC's move, urging Ankara to continue reforms. 
The World Bank pledged on Wednesday to assist Turkey in regard to accession matters.
As for the EC's statement that Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the Union in 2007, Britain's Straw again voiced support. 
He also said Croatia should expect to start accession talks in early 2005, if co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal continues. 
Slovenia, a new member of the Union, urged its neighbour to address unresolved issues -- a reference to a longstanding territorial dispute over Piran Bay.

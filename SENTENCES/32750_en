NEW YORK, United States -- On Thursday (12 December), the UN Security Council praised the successful completion of UNMIBH's mandate, which is set to expire on 31 December. 
The Council issued a declaration, welcoming the EU's decision to deploy a subsequent 500-man police mission starting 1 January. 
Jacques Klein, the head of the UNMIBH, said "We leave behind a legacy of democratic law enforcement, police forces fit for Europe", adding that there were now 15,786 certified law enforcement officers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.He urged Bosnian authorities to arrest the top war crime suspects wanted by the UN tribunal. 
Klein also called for a more streamlined government bureaucracy and better fiscal discipline. 
The Security Council adopted a statement urging the Bosnian authorities to press ahead with reforms if they want continued international support. 
The Council also adopted a statement on the agreement between Yugoslavia and Croatia on the Prevlaka Peninsula, which resulted in the end of the UN observer mission there.
On another note, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Wednesday extending the mandate of Russian peacekeepers participating in SFOR until July 2003. 
The Russian contingent now consists of 350 servicemen.

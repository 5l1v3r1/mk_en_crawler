BERLIN, Germany -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Monday (November 9th) that resolving the name dispute with Macedonia is a precondition for Skopje's accession to the EU.
At an informal meeting in Berlin with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- on the sidelines of events to mark the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall -- Papandreou said "this is an absolutely clear" message.
In his address to participants in the celebrations, Papandreou called on Europe to tear down the last wall within its borders, "the one that divides Cyprus in two." (Kathimerini, ANA-MPA, Makfax - 10/11/09)

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo is ready to defend its 2008 independence declaration before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), media reported on Friday (April 10th).
British expert Michael Wood will lead Kosovo's legal team at the ICJ to debate Serbia's motion questioning the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence in February 2008.
The deadline for sending documentation to the ICJ is April 17th.
The foreign ministry says it expects a large number of countries to support the legality of Kosovo's independence before the court.
In other news, two media organisations conducted an investigation and concluded that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) abducted civilians in Kosovo a decade ago, mistreated -- and in some cases -- killed them.
The BBC and the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network published their conclusions on Thursday.
They quoted sources who said Kosovo Serbs, ethnic Albanians and Romas were among the estimated 2,000 people who went missing during and after the 1999 war.
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci rejected the allegations.
He acknowledging that some individuals "abused the KLA uniforms" after the war but stressed that the KLA had distanced itself from such acts.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu signed a decree Thursday (October 22nd) regarding a referendum on making parliament unicameral and reducing the number of parliament members from 471 to 300.
The decree sets the referendum date during the first round of the presidential election on November 22nd.
Despite opposition from MPs, Basescu says a unicameral parliament is the only way to steer parliamentary reform when the major parties are unwilling to change the status quo.
Outgoing prime minister Emil Boc estimates savings of 30m euros if both events are organised at the same polling stations.

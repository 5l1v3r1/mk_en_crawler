TIRANA, Albania -- Journalists and human rights organisations on Monday (January 31st) condemned the violence against journalists who were covering the violent anti-government rally held on January 21st.
The South and East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) said members of the National Guard attacked journalists repeatedly.
"Such attacks are unacceptable, and it is particularly worrying if they are coming from the National Guard which is supposed to function as a safeguard of rules and order within a society," said SEEMO Secretary-General Oliver Vujovic.
SEEMO also urged authorities to take legal action against those responsible.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Montenegrin government has decided to dismiss the director of the top security prison in Spuz, where a recent police inspection uncovered serious violations. 
After the cabinet met in extraordinary session Tuesday (13 September), Dragan Pajovic was removed as director and replaced by parliament member Bozidar Vuskanovic. 
Following the assassination of Montenegrin criminal police chief Slavoljub Scekic, riot police raided the Spuz prison in early September searching for clues. 
They discovered that a number of prisoners had mobile phones, drugs and other banned items.

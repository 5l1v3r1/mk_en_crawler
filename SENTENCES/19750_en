ATHENS, Greece -- Three car dealers' offices and five bank branches were damaged in a series of arson attacks in Athens early Monday (January 21st). 
Police suggest the attacks were co-ordinated, occurring within a very short period in a number of locations. 
Among the targets were a branch of the US bank Citigroup and a Porsche dealership. 
No injuries were reported.
Early Sunday, a bomb exploded in Greece's northern suburb of Halandri, damaging a car belonging to Chilean diplomats. 
Shortly afterward, an anonymous person called the office of the Eleftherotypia newspaper taking responsibility for the attack on behalf of a movement that calls itself Fighting Solidarity. 
A couple of hours later, a Molotov cocktail damaged the exterior of the Eurobank office in downtown Athens. 
No injuries were reported in either incident.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Christian Diaconescu said on Thursday (April 30th) that Romania will handle citizenship applications from Moldovans on a case-by-case basis, adding that this approach would guard against indiscriminate approvals.
Some EU members, worried about the possibility of mass immigration into the bloc, have objected to Bucharest's April decision to expedite the citizenship process for Moldovans, many of whom are ethnic Romanians.

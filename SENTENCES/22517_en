ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday (May 11th) that Turkish forces will not stop fighting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) until they eliminate terrorism and stop violence.
Erdogan made the statements in Antalya, where he offered his condolences to the family of a soldier killed on Saturday in clashes with the PKK in northern Iraq.
He encouraged militants who want to abandon terrorism to take advantage of an amnesty law in Turkey.
"Give up this wrong path before you cause more sorrow for your families," he said.
He added that the government's measures had isolated the PKK and depleted its logistical and financial resources.
Turkey's fight against terrorism absolutely would succeed, Erdogan vowed.
The military continued its anti-PKK offensive Sunday by destroying a propaganda centre in northern Iraq.
The General Staff described it as responsible for the PKK's contacts with the media.

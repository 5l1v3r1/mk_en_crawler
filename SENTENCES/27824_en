PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX justified on Thursday (May 20th) the screening of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's luggage, and that of four other cabinet members, at the Pristina Airport on Wednesday, before a flight to Turkey.
EULEX Customs Spokesperson Alexandra George described the x-rays as a "normal" part of airport security measures.
"All passengers that pass through the VIP area should have their luggage controlled through the x-ray checks," George said.
But a source at Pristina Airport said EULEX customs officers are never at the VIP area as they were on Wednesday.
Among those travelling with Thaci was Minister for Transport and Telecommunications Fatmir Limaj, who EULEX is investigating for suspected of abuse of power in connection with road construction tenders.

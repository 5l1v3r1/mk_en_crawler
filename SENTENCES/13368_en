SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) police said on Tuesday (25 October) that two terror suspects attempted to resist search of their premises and arrest during a police operation last week.
Three people -- one Bosnian, one Swede and one Turkish citizen -- were apprehended for allegedly planning suicide bombings.
Police now say the Swedish and Turkish citizens tried to prevent police officers from conducting a search and one even exerted armed resistance.
BiH Deputy Minister of Security Dragan Mektic says security services are checking 40 other people with suspected links to terror organisations.

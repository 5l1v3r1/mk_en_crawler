HELSINKI, Finland -- Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Thursday (December 4th) joined the so-called Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants, a co-operation mechanism initiated by the United States in 2003. 
The two countries became official members of the partnership initiative at a ceremony in Helsinki on the sidelines of an annual meeting of the OSCE foreign ministers. 
The Adriatic Charter, which consists of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia, extended invitations to Montenegro and BiH during a meeting in New York in September. 
Albania and Croatia received invitations to join NATO at its April summit. 
Greece vetoed Macedonia's bid, citing the long-running name dispute between the two countries.

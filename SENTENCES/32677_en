ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government on Friday (20 December) sealed agreements with the leaders of the Serb Orthodox Church and the Islamic community that would regulate the status of the two religious communities in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.
The document ensures financial support from the state budget, restitution of seized property and proportional representation in national institutions.
Following the signing ceremony, Prime Minister Ivica Racan said the agreement indicates Croatia is a "democratic, multicultural and multi-religious state." (Tanjug, AFP - 20/12/02)

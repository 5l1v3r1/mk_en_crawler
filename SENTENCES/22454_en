TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party's (DP) proposal for substantial changes to the constitution has strained relations both within the ruling coalition and with the main opposition Socialist Party (SP).
The DP's proposal suggests changes to the procedure for electing presidents and to presidential responsibilities, as well as amendments to the general prosecutors' mandate and no-confidence motion rules.
SP member Fatmir Xhafa lashed out at the DP on Thursday (April 10th) for proposing that parliament should vote on these changes en bloc with electoral reform.
The head of the DP's caucus, Astrit Patozi, defended the package, saying it would help Albania avoid crises and would guarantee political stability.
Nard Ndoka, leader of the Demo-Christian party, weighed in too on Thursday.
He expressed concern that the electoral reforms drafted by the DP and the SP would threaten representation by smaller parties.

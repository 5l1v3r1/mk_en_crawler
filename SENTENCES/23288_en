PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu on Wednesday (May 27th) cancelled a planned official visit to Macedonia amid reports suggesting he would not be received with state honours.
His office said Sejdiu opted out "after Macedonia changed the essence of the official visit".
The visit was scheduled for Thursday.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Several explosions shook an Istanbul municipal building Thursday (August 7th), injuring one person. 
According to local media reports, one blast occurred in the parking lot of the building in Uskudar on Istanbul's Asian side. 
Two more were audible from a neighbouring cemetery, Uskudar Mayor Mehmet Cakir told the Anadolu news agency. 
Broadcaster CNN Turk said hand grenades or small bombs -- designed to frighten rather than kill â were the suspected cause. 
One man suffered a minor leg injury, NTV television said. 
If investigators confirm a bombing, it would be the second in Istanbul in less than two weeks.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi said on Monday (November 23rd) that he is ready to intervene to find a solution to the political crisis, but said it all depends on the political parties. 
Topi explained he will negotiate between the government and the opposition Socialist Party, which has been boycotting the work of parliament while insisting on an investigation into the "manipulated June general elections process". 
The SP organised a three-day protest at the weekend and then issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding it investigate the elections or face more protests.

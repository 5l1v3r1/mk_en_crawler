SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) -- In a letter to Serbian President Boris Tadic on Thursday (April 26th) regarding co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said he hopes the country will "at last comply with these obligations in full and without delay".
Schwarz-Schilling also briefed Tadic about the latest developments regarding war crimes co-operation and BiH, in light of the debate that followed the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ruling in a genocide case BiH filed against Serbia.
On Friday, Schwarz-Schilling meets with the prime ministers of BiH, the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska to discuss efforts to boost the economy of Srebrenica.
Genocide there in 1995 was the subject of the ICJ ruling.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Plamen Panayotov, the new deputy prime minister overseeing EU integration, presented his plan Wednesday (30 July) to meet commitments for NATO and EU integration.
His short-term goals regarding EU accession include obtaining an evaluation of Bulgaria's efforts in this year's report by the European Commission.
A positive evaluation would result in completing accession negotiations in 2004 and joining the EU in January 2007.
Panayotov's primary task, however, will be to raise public awareness of the commitments Bulgaria makes in joining NATO and the EU and of the procedures necessary for their implementation.

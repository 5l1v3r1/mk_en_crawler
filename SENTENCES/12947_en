ATHENS, Greece -- The Federation of Bank Employee Unions decided to end its four-week-long strike on Friday (1 July) in light of Thursday's vote in parliament on the controversial social security reform bill.
Strikers warned however that they are prepared to resume their protest, should the banks attempt to implement the new social security measures.
The bill and related amendments sparked fierce debate in parliament.

Albania is building its first wind park and plans to export energy to Italy under a new initiative. 
Two companies -- Italy's Moncada Costruzioni and Enpower Albania -- are behind the project, which could provide a capacity of 500MW.
Production is expected to begin by 2010. 
Energy will travel through a power cable stretching from the Albanian port of Vlora to Italy's Brindisi, at a depth of 825m.
"In the near future, [the cable] could enhance the import of energy produced by conventional plants that [we] intend to develop on Albanian soil," said a statement from Moncada Construzioni. 
In August, the Albanian government approved the use of forest and pastureland in the municipality of Vlora for development of the wind park.
Experts say the potential for similar projects exists at a number of locations in Albania -- especially in the lowlands, along the coast and in the hills. 
The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERE) has now licensed several companies to develop this potential.
Last year, the first licence went to the Hera company, which plans to build a wind farm in the area of Kapshtica and Bilisht, southeastern Albania, with a capacity of 150MW. 
The project will cost 240m euros.
The Terpani Monuntains near the southern city of Berat is another area planned for the development of wind energy. 
The project investment is estimated at 460m euros, with an installed capacity of 225MW.
Italgest, an Italian wind energy company, has proposed building a wind power plant near Kryevidhi, 50km from Tirana. 
The facility would generate 150MW, and the company's investment will reach 202m euros.

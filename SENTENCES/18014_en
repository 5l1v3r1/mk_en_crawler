ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities said on Monday (February 19th) that they are investigating small sugar packets bearing Adolf Hitler's image and Nazi jokes, found in cafÃ©s around the country.
The Pozega-Slavonjia regional police are investigating whether a local company, Pinka, has anything to do with it.
In other news Monday, the Zagreb County Court announced that it resumed hearings in the case against Branimir Glavas, the parliament member accused of war crimes against ethnic Serbs in Osijek in 1991.
The proceedings were suspended for a couple of months as Glavas recovered from a debilitating hunger strike.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana met with senior officials in Belgrade on Thursday (23 October) and said federal authorities face three main tasks on the road to EU integration.
First, he said, the government needs to work on the action plan aimed at ensuring a positive assessment by the EU feasibility study of the country's chances of entering the Union.
Secondly, authorities must recognise that the feasibility study will go beyond economic reforms and extend to political developments.
Finally, Solana said, an unconditional consensus should be reached in the two republics concerning EU integration.

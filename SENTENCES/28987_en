TIRANA, Albania/SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Tirana was the scene of flag-waving celebrations Monday (November 8th) after the EU interior ministers officially decided to lift the visa regimes for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Fireworks were followed by an evening concert. 
At a press conference earlier, political leaders underscored the achievement, saying it demonstrates that Albania belongs to the continent.
Bosnian officials also hailed the EU's decision, saying it acknowledges efforts by authorities and sends the public an encouraging signal. 
The head of BiH's negotiating team on visa liberalisation, Bakir Dautbasic, warned citizens to observe strict rules while entering EU member states, or face sanctions. 
He also warned against seeking asylum as was the case with some citizens of Serbia and Macedonia after they received visa-free travel last December. 
Security Minister Sadik Ahmetovic reiterated that BiH will justify Brussels' trust. 
High Representative Valentin Inzko said that the EU's decision to abolish the visa regime marks a new era for the country in terms of its relationship with the EU. 
Visa-free travel to participating EU countries begins on December 15th.

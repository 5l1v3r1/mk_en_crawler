ATHENS, Greece - Employment and Social Protection Minister Vassilios Magginas -- one of the key authors of the disputed pension reform programme in the country -- resigned on Saturday (December 15th) amid a series of scandals revealed by the local press. 
Earlier this week, local media reported that Magginas had employed illegal immigrants to work in his house, and that he built a second house in Athens' suburbs in violation of the city planning rules. 
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis accepted the resignation and appointed Fani Palli-Petralia, former minister of tourist development, to take over the position. 
Greece was hit by a 24-hour strike last week against the government's plans to overhaul the country's pension system in order to reduce public spending and to boost the country's finances.

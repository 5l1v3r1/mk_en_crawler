THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Lawyers representing retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina on Monday (February 25th) insisted that prosecutors at The Hague drop the murder charges against him, due to a lack of evidence. 
"Despite repeated requests by the defence, the prosecution did not provide any evidence proving that Gotovina was informed of any of the mentioned murders," attorneys Luka Misitic and Greg Keho said. 
Points six and seven of the indictment accuse Gotovina and two other Croatian generals, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, of murdering more than 150 Serb civilians during the so-called "Storm Operation" between July and August 1995.

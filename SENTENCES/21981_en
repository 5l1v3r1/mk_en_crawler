PARIS, France -- Late on Monday (July 21st), a joint session of parliament approved a constitutional amendment proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy, widely viewed as a move to hinder Turkey's EU accession. 
The measure envisions holding a referendum in France on each treaty approving the accession of a new EU member. 
This provision, however, can be avoided if a three-fifths majority in the senate and the lower house opt for parliamentary ratification instead of ratification via referendum. 
Sarkozy opposes Turkey's EU membership, insisting the country is not located in Europe. 
Instead of full membership, he backs a "privileged partnership" for Turkey.

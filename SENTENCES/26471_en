BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday (December 11th) that his country will live up to its obligations and find a way out of the difficult financial situation it is experiencing.
"We are not asking for any gifts," Papandreou said as the EU leaders wrapped up a two-day summit in Brussels.
His statement came after Union leaders urged the country late Thursday to deal with the crisis caused by its huge budget deficit -- 300 billion euros -- the highest level in Greece's history.
A draft budget is "one important step in the right direction but more measures are required", European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, expressing confidence that Greece will manage the situation successfully.
Papandreou told summit participants his government will take decisive and immediate measures to improve the economy.

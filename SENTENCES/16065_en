BELGRADE, Serbia -- A new poll by the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy suggests that for the first time in months, the pro-Western Democratic Party (DS) is as popular as the Serb Radical Party (SRS). 
According to results released on Friday (15 September), both Serbian President Boris Tadic's DS and the SRS would attract 30% of voter support, if parliamentary elections were held now. 
The ruling Democratic Party of Serbia and the Socialist Party would receive 14% and 6% respectively.
On Monday, however, the Danas newspaper quoted the results of a separate poll by the Medium Gallup agency, which suggests the SRS maintains a lead with 35%. 
DS was in second place, with 23%.

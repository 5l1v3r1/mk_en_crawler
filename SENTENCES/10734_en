BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition on Monday (8 November) accused Prime Minister Adrian Nastase of selling out the country's interests in accession talks with the EU. 
The row began after Guenter Verheugen, the EU commissioner for enlargement, said last week that the negotiations could be concluded by 24 November, four days ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections in Romania. 
Opposition presidential candidate Traian Basescu said the EU might have pushed Nastase to make too many concessions in exchange for "a 30-second appearance on television" signaling completion of EU negotiations.
In other news Monday, Nastase criticised what he described as "widespread" bureaucracy in the country. 
Addressing a conference on competition in Bucharest, Nastase acknowledged bureaucracy is a main obstacle to foreign investment.

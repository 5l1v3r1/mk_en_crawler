GENEVA, Switzerland -- Control over the refugee return process will be transferred to authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as of next year, according to High Representative Paddy Ashdown. 
He presented an action plan for 2004 to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva on Monday (21 July), saying the international community must provide continued assistance.
In other news, Republika Srpska's government said it would reconstruct 110 houses for Serb returnees in the Federation of BiH (FBiH). 
The announcement came as a delegation including representatives of the BiH central and entity governments visited settlements in FBiH that are largely populated by returnees.
Also Monday, the EU ambassadors to BiH urged Mostar authorities to resolve issues related to the status of the ethnically divided town. 
They urged the Bosniak Party for Democratic Action to end its boycott of a commission drafting a statement on status.

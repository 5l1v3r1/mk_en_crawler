BUCHAREST, Romania -- A small Carpatair Airlines Saab 2000 managed to land safely at the Timisoara International Airport on Saturday (February 28th) without use of its landing gear. 
Though shaken up, none of the 51 people was injured. 
The plane, travelling from Moldova, circled the airport for two hours to use up fuel as firefighters covered the runway with a bed of flame retardant foam. 
With the plane's landing gear jammed, the pilots were forced to land the plane "on its belly".

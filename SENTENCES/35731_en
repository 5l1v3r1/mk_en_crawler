SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A report on Bulgaria's arms exports, jointly prepared by the Centre for Studying Democracy and the British Safe World organisation, calls for more transparency to improve the mechanisms controlling risky exports.
The document will be formally presented at a roundtable Monday.
It notes that there were no registered cases of large-scale illegal deals involving small arms and light armament during the past two years.
But it warns that the modernisation and downsizing of the Bulgarian Army will result in larger reserves of weapons and munitions, which in turn could increase the possibility of illegal deliveries.

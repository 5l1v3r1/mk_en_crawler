LUXEMBOURG -- Following a meeting with the EU ministerial troika in Luxembourg, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected recent claims by Italian counterpart Massimo D'Alema that Moscow is preparing its own draft resolution on Kosovo.
Lavrov stressed that it was Russia's idea to send a UN fact-finding mission to Belgrade and Pristina and that his government will wait to see its conclusions.
He stressed to the EU troika members -- German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, EU security chief Javier Solana, and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn -- that implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1244 on Kosovo is necessary to resolve the status issue.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former President Ion Iliescu confirmed in a media interview Friday (7 January) that he would become more involved in the activities of his Social Democratic Party (PSD), following its election defeat late last year.
Term limits prevented Iliescu from seeking another term, so he now holds a parliament seat within PSD's caucus.
The party currently stands in opposition.
Iliescu says party leaders have much to discuss following the defeat but that the most important issue for the country is preserving political and institutional stability.

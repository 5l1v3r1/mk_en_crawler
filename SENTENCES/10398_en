NEW YORK, United States -- UNMIK head Soren Jessen-Petersen cancelled the results of a tender which awarded Kosovo's second mobile phone operator license to a local businessman.
Jessen-Petersen said a new tender would be held in a transparent manner.
Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi objected to the deal because of corruption allegations.
In other news Thursday, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Thursday (21 October) that members of the Kosovo Serb community must vote in Saturday's parliamentary elections "to ensure that their interests and concerns are represented and promoted".
He urged local leaders to do their utmost to ensure participation in the democratic process.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Sunday (1 June), UNMIK head Michael Steiner ruled out the possibility of talks on the final status of Kosovo at the EU summit in Thessaloniki. 
In an interview with <I>Zeri</I>, Steiner said the summit would address a universal model for the whole region rather than discuss specific solutions for Kosovo.
Meanwhile, two Serb groups in Kosovo are demanding the resignation of Belgrade's co-ordinator on Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic. 
According to Council of Kosovo leader Rada Trajkovic, Belgrade has not fully advocated the interests of Kosovo Serbs.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Luka Karadzic, brother of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, confirmed on Sunday (July 27th) that defence attorneys have submitted an appeal against his brother's transfer to The Hague war crimes tribunal.
Serbian judges have three days to issue the final order on Karadzic's extradition.
Meanwhile, in an interview Saturday with the English-language Russian news channel Russia Today, Luka criticised his brother's arrest.
"I deeply regret that the leadership of Serbia doesn't have the wisdom and courage to know that this is not a good move for the country.
But it will understand because all the West's promises have never been kept.
We have seen this a few times, and so why should we believe them now?" (RTS, BBC, AP, Russia Today, B92, Gazeta.ru - 27/07/08)

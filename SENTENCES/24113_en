ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Parliament's (EP) recently approved draft report on Turkey's progress towards EU accession has stirred up government circles. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday (March 13th) that his government would address the reform agenda -- which includes amendments to the constitution -- immediately after local elections two weeks from now. 
The EP's draft report expressed concerns over the slowdown of reforms in Turkey and urged the government to demonstrate its determination for the reform process.
In other news Friday, army spokesperson Metin Gurak announced that Turkish war planes bombed suspected Kurdistan Workers' Party positions in Zap-Avashin, northern Iraq on Thursday. 
Ankara insists terrorists plan attacks on Turkey from such posts.

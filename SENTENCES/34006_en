ZAGREB, Croatia -- The two main political rivals in the 23 November parliamentary elections -- Social Democratic Party leader and incumbent Prime Minister Ivica Racan and Croatian Democratic Union leader Ivo Sanader -- agreed on the importance of the EU integration process during a pre-election debate broadcast live on Friday (31 October). 
While arguing about other issues mainly related to the success of economic reforms by the current government, as well as Croatia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, the two agreed that the country's future lies within the EU. 
Zagreb hopes for membership in 2007.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Four Serbs from Gorazdevac in western Kosovo face charges of threatening UNMIK chief Joachim Rucker and KFOR Commander Xavier de Marnhac during a December visit by the officials to Gorazdevac, just after the general elections in Kosovo. 
Milivoje Zdravkovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, Milic Milicevic and Radojko Dunic allegedly issued threats against the UN staff and others accompanying them.
In other news Tuesday (May 13th), de Marnhac reiterated that the KFOR deployment is in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and said the mission is awaiting new orders after the constitution enters into force on June 15th. 
"We are committed to continuing our mission despite any circumstances that may occur," he said during a visit to the municipality of Viti.

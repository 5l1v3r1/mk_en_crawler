ATHENS, Greece -- Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas reassured Greece's Arab partners Wednesday (August 18th) that friendship with them remains strong following a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
"Improving Greek-Israeli relations is for the good of Greece and all countries in the Middle East ... 
and does not exclude our close co-operation with the Arab world and most of all with our Palestinian friends," Droutsas said in an interview with radio Flash. 
He added that meetings with Netanyahu on Monday and Tuesday were "very useful and completely successful, because we reached certain goals -- deepening relations and co-operation with Israel".

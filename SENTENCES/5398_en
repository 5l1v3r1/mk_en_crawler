The global recession led to a slight drop in the average level of economic freedom around the world for the first time in 25 years, a leading Canadian public policy think-tank concludes in a new survey published on Monday (September 20th).
"In response to the economic decline of 2008, many countries opted for perverse credit expansion and regulatory policies, damaging economic freedom and hindering future growth," said Fred McMahon, vice-president of international policy research at the Vancouver-based Fraser Institute. 
"[But ]even in the wake of recession, the quality of life in nations with free and open markets is vastly superior to that of countries with government-managed economies."
The average score fell from 6.74 in 2007 to 6.67 in 2008 (the most recent year for which data was available), the think-tank said in its annual Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) report, covering 141 jurisdictions.
The group rates and ranks the surveyed nations and territories in a summary index, using 42 variables in five broad areas: size of government, legal structure and security of property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation of credit, labour, and business. 
The degree of economic freedom for each component is measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest.
With an overall score of 9.05, Hong Kong retains first place in this year's EFW index, and is again followed by Singapore (8.70) and New Zealand (8.27). 
As in 2009, Zimbabwe (3.57) was ranked last among the 141 nations in this EFW index.
The Fraser Institute listed Turkey among several countries, where the relative levels of economic freedom have improved significantly over the past three decades. 
The country, which scored only 3.77 back in 1980, was given an overall 6.82 in the 2010 report, up from 6.44 in the one last year. 
This allowed Turkey to jump 18 places, to 74th, in the EFW released on Monday.
Turkey's score is close to the average for the Southeast Europe (SEE) region -- 6.81 -- which is also above the global average of 6.74, as measured by the Canadian think-tank.
Six other SEE countries -- Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Macedonia and Montenegro -- also received better marks than last year. 
With an overall score of 7.54, Cyprus was able to move up 11 places to the world's 20th most economically-free nation, and the region's leader.
The only other SEE countries among the top 50 were Bulgaria, ranked 36th on the basis of its overall score of 7.31, and Albania, which took 48th with 7.18. 
Both nations moved up five places in the 2010 EFW index.
A score of 6.90 entitled Montenegro to the 66th position, up from 78th in the one last year. 
Macedonia moved up eight places to 72nd with 6.83. 
Croatia retained its 87th position with a mark of 6.51, only 0.02 point better than the one the Fraser Institute gave it last year.
The other four SEE countries covered in this new report -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Greece, Romania and Serbia -- all slipped in the EFW index.
Greece fell one notch to 60th, with a score of 6.95. 
BiH, the region's laggard, lost a further seven places to 111th, based on its overall mark of 6.03.
Economic freedom also declined in Romania, which was hit by the global financial and economic soon after it started spreading in late 2008. 
The country dropped nine slots to 85th, with a score of 6.58.
Serbia fell ten places to 97th, based on its mark of 6.31, the second-lowest for the region after BiH's.

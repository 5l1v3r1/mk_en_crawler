BUCHAREST, Romania -- The largest trade union in the country, Cartel Alfa, announced plans on Monday (January 18th) to launch protests against the government's employment policies. 
Union President Bogdan Hossu said the unemployment rate is soaring, and would be as high as 200,000 people by early February. 
Hossu urged the government to adopt additional measures to maintain jobs, such as the "technical unemployment" option, which allows workers to take unpaid leave for an indefinite period of time. 
Hossu vowed a general strike unless the government co-operates.

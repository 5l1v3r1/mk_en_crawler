SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH's (FBiH) Parliamentary House of Peoples was expected to discuss the nominees for FBiH president and vice president on Tuesday (21 January). 
The session will be the first since Friday's controversial inaugural session. 
Some Serb deputies boycotted that session, protesting that the Serb parties' request for postponement - until they form a Serb caucus like their Bosniak and Croat colleagues - had been rejected. 
The Croatian Parliamentary group is nominating Niko Lozancic as FBiH president. 
Sahbaz Dzihanovic was nominated as the Bosniak vice president, while those Serb members who did attend Friday's session nominated Desnica Radivojevic for Serb vice president.

TIRANA, Albania -- Former Prime Minister Ilir Meta announced Thursday (12 August) that his Socialist Movement for Integration would adopt a platform and statute in order to become a political party within a week.
He said the party was determined to oppose the ruling Socialist Party (SP), which he described as having been "usurped".
Meta, a former SP member, headed the Albanian government from October 1999 to January 2002, when he resigned due to internal party rifts.

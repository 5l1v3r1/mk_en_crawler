ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament wrapped up the first round of debate on a controversial series of constitutional amendments proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) early Tuesday (April 20th). 
Representatives of the AKP, the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party (BDP) took the floor to express their parties' views. 
After discussions on the package as a whole, lawmakers proceeded to specific articles. 
With only the AKP and MHP members voting, the first two articles were approved. 
The AKP proposes nine straight days of debate and votes, except for Friday, which is National Day in Turkey.
The CHP, the BDP and the smaller opposition Democratic Leftist Party are refusing to attend parliamentary sessions devoted to debating the amendments, which they say strip power from the secular courts. 
If necessary, the AKP has said they will hold a public referendum on the reforms.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Cables belonging to the mobile operator IPKO were burned near Zubin Potok in northern Kosovo late Saturday (October 2nd). 
Kosovo Police Deputy Director in northern Kosovo Ergin Medic said KFOR noticed the burning cables and notified the Kosovo police. 
This is the second time in days that IPKO property has been damaged in northern Kosovo.
Authorities suspect the incidents are related to the removal of Serbian mobile operators' antennas -- deemed illegal by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority -- from Kosovo. 
About 23 stations have been removed since the beginning of last week.

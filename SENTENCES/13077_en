PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Montenegrin Parliament's extraordinary session on the independence referendum issue has been postponed again, this time until Wednesday (1 March).
It was to have been held Saturday, but was postponed at the request of the pro-independence ruling coalition, which is still deciding whether to accept the EU proposal for the vote margin.
The opposition has accepted the EU suggestion, which stipulates that at least 55 per cent of voters participating in the referendum must back independence for the poll to succeed.

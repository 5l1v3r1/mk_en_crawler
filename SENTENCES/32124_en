TIRANA, Albania -- Eight parliamentary parties declared they oppose constitutional changes related to the election system. 
At a meeting Sunday (13 October), all parliamentary parties except for the ruling Socialist Party, Democratic Party, Republican Party and Party of Democratic Union met to review the changes. 
The leader of the Reformed Democrats, Genc Pollo, said that the number of mandates necessary for passing the parliamentary threshold must not be changed. 
Skender Gjinushi, chairman of the Social Democrats, said reform would eliminate small parties from the parliamentary scene. 
The meeting ended with a joint statement calling for constitutional reform that serves to ensure free and fair elections with as broad a political representation as possible.

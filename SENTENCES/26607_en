SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, connecting Bulgaria's Black Sea coast with Greece's Aegean Sea coast, may be delayed for another 18 months, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said on Tuesday (December 8th). 
Speaking at a round table organised by the Economist Conference, Borisov said the environmental impact study, required by law, could last for a year and a half, which will effectively block any work. 
Russia, the major partner, has been pressing the Bulgarian government to proceed with the project, which was negotiated by the previous cabinet.

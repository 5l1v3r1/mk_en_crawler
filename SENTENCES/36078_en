SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee issued a report Sunday (21 March) on the development of human rights protections in Bulgaria in 2003.
The committee cited the adoption of anti-discrimination and ombudsman laws as examples of progress.
It also praised guidelines issued by the interior ministry, giving detainees the right to a lawyer and a doctor, as well as the right to inform close relatives.
Cases of reported physical violence had decreased, the committee said.
However, the report also pointed to areas in which there was no improvement, including freedom of expression and the right to asylum.

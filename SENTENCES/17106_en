BELGRADE, Serbia -- The leader of the junior government partner G17 Plus, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, confirmed on Sunday (October 1st) that the four G17 Plus cabinet ministers have submitted their resignations to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
The party decided in May that it would leave the cabinet if issues blocking Serbia's co-operation with the war crimes tribunal were not resolved by October, allowing Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU to resume.
Brussels has put the talks on hold because of the insufficient co-operation, and specifically because of Serbia's failure to extradite Ratko Mladic, one of the tribunal's most-wanted indictees.
G17 Plus's move will not take effect until parliament formally accepts their resignations at its next session in November.
Until then, the ministers will continue to perform their duties.
Dinkic said his party would now focus on getting the new constitution approved in a national referendum later this month.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Shipping on the lower parts of the Danube has become difficult as a result of low water levels and wreckage from several recent wars, Serbian officials reported Tuesday (26 August).
Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Zelko Majer said that 50 per cent fewer goods are being shipped through this part of the river.
Shippers have been forced to load less cargo on barges to keep them from getting stuck on sand bars.
The problem is compounded by World War II wreckage that has been exposed in a number of locations.

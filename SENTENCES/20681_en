BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Tuesday (January 8th) sent a letter to Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu asking him to propose another nominee for justice minister.
Basescu wrote that the current choice, Senator Norica Nicolai, of the ruling National Liberal Party (PNL), is unlikely to garner much public trust in light of a past incident in which the senator allowed her niece to vote for her in parliament.
Former Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu stepped down in early December to allow an investigation against him stemming from a questionable real estate deal.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An association uniting about 50,000 former Bosnian Serb prisoners of war filed a complaint Monday (November 24th) at the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council against prosecutors for failing to act on atrocities against Serbs. 
According to the victims, prosecutor Milorad Barasin and his deputy, David Schwendiman, "did not prosecute more than 300 cases they received from The Hague war crimes tribunal in 2004." The cases were related to war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.

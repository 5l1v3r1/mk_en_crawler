BUCHAREST, Romania -- Youth and Sports Minister Monica Iacob Ridzi resigned on Tuesday (July 14th) amid allegations that she abused her position and misappropriated state funds, media reported. 
Her resignation came after a parliamentary panel recommended the launch of an official investigation against her for alleged embezzlement of about 630,000 euros spent on organising May 2nd celebrations marking Youth Day. 
Ridzi was also accused of using public money to support the campaign of President Traian Basescu's daughter, Elena Basescu, who was recently elected to the European Parliament. 
Ridzi denies the allegations and vowed to fight them in court. 
Later Tuesday, Basescu appointed Senator Luminita Sorina Placinta to replace Ridzi.

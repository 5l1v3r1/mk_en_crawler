TIRANA, Albania -- Chief Prosecutor Ina Rama on Monday (October 27th) met with Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic to discuss alleged cases of organ harvesting years ago in Albania. 
According to former chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte's book, "The Hunt", hundreds of Serbs and Roma were murdered in Albania solely for their bodily organs. 
Del Ponte says this trafficking in human organs happened during the Kosovo war in Albania's northern village of Gur. 
During the meeting Monday, Rama said the results of a domestic investigation discredited the claims. 
Vukcevic gave him materials Serbian investigators have collected on the case, said Bruno Vekaric, spokesman for Serbia's war crimes prosecutor's office.

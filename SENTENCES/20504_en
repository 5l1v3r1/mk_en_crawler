SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Thursday (January 10th) ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Michael Shields, a Liverpool fan sentenced to ten years in prison for attempted murder. 
Shields visited Bulgaria shortly after attending a Champions League final in Istanbul in May 2005. 
He was found guilty of hitting a barman with a large cobblestone during a drunken brawl. 
The victim suffered a severe head injury. 
A court first sentenced Shields to 15 years but it was reduced to ten years on appeal. 
He was transferred to a British prison after serving one year in Bulgaria.

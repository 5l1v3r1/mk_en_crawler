PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairwoman Nesrin Lushta said on Thursday (July 30th) that organising the November 15th local elections "is not easy" without the OSCE, but "we are on the right track".
She added that the CEC has asked the European Commission for help.
She vowed the election will be transparent, despite the fact there will be no surveillance cameras at polling stations.
Pristina is urging Kosovo Serbs to participate, while Belgrade is calling for a boycott.
In other news Thursday, the OSCE Mission in Kosovo recommended a review of the legal framework for the Commercial Court.
"The court operates as a relic of old times, when the state was the main factor.
If the court does not adapt to the current circumstances, there is a risk of it becoming completely irrelevant," a report presented by the head of OSCE's legal monitoring department, Harold Dampier, said.

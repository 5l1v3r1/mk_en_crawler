BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wrapped up a four-day trip to Southeast Europe on Saturday (18 February), reiterating the importance of reforms and regional co-operation as major factors in EU integration.
Barroso, who was accompanied by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, urged governments to commit to reforms, in exchange for full support from Brussels.
Barroso and Rehn visited Pristina and Skopje on Friday, and Tirana and Sarajevo on Saturday, following stops in Zagreb and Belgrade earlier this week.
In Pristina, Barroso called for compromise by all parties in the negotiations on Kosovo's final status.
Talks on decentralisation begin Monday in Vienna.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku arrived Wednesday (19 July) on an official two-day visit to Slovenia. 
He is expected to meet with Slovenian counterpart Janez Jansa, Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, President Janez Drnovsek and Parliament Speaker France Cukjati on Thursday.
In other news, Ceku called on ethnic Albanian leaders in Macedonia to refrain from harsh comments and threats, saying these could harm the already fragile Kosovo status talks. 
He was referring to a recent statement by Democratic Union of Integration (DUI) deputy leader Musa Djaferi, who threatened election winner VMRO-DPMNE because of its decision to form a government coalition with the Democratic Party of Albanians. 
Ceku advised DUI to resolve its problems through peaceful and democratic means only.

TIRANA, Albania -- NATO closed two military bases in Albania Friday (11 November), one at the Durres port on the Adriatic, and the other in the inland area of Kukes, bordering Kosovo.
Officials say the closures demonstrate the improved situation in Southeast Europe and the accomplishments of the NATO mission in Albania.
The bases were established in 1998-1999 to guarantee NATO logistical support and security on the roads to Kosovo.

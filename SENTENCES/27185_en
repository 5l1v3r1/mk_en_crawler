ATHENS, Greece -- An earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale struck early Tuesday (November 3rd) in the Ionian Sea, near Greece's western coast. 
The epicentre was 334km west of Athens. 
No damage or injuries have been reported.
In other news, Deputy Civil Protection Minister Spyros Vougias announced on Monday that authorities have shut down a controversial detention centre on Lesbos Island that human rights organisations have targeted for criticism. 
The Bagani centre, which sheltered around 900 illegal immigrants, will be overhauled to improve living conditions. 
Immigrants who had been staying there have been taken to other facilities.
Separately, a trade union at the port of Piraeus, the largest in the country, are staging a strike Tuesday and Wednesday against a concession made to the Chinese company Cosco Pacific. 
Workers are afraid it will lead to job cuts. 
Protestors insist that the new PASOK-led government renegotiate the 35-year-long concession. 
Authorities, however, have explained that the deal, which entered into force Tuesday, can no longer be modified. 
Tuesday's walkout follows a 17-day strike last month.

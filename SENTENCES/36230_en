SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is expected to submit a no-confidence motion Thursday (4 March) against the coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg.
BSP cites what it describes as a lack of social responsibility by the ruling coalition.
The motion will likely fail, however, as the rightist opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) does not support it.
In other news, Union of Free Democrats (UFD) is considering whether to form a coalition with the minor nationalist party VMRO for the future parliamentary elections.
This is according to UFD member and Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski, who met on Wednesday with VMRO leader Krasimir Karakachanov.

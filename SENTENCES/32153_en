BUCHAREST, Romania -- A delegation of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) headed by Prime Minister Adrian Nastase will approach President Ion Iliescu on Wednesday (13 November) about the possibility of early elections.
Iliescu will consult the other parliamentary parties before making a decision, but he has previously opposed the idea.
Officially, PSD is seeking early elections to establish a well-defined 2003-2007 mandate aimed at boosting the EU accession process.
Unofficially, it is to capitalise on the relative weakness of other political parties, as demonstrated in local elections held Sunday.

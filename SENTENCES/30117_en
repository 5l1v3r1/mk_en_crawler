TIRANA, Albania -- Hundreds of businesses have filed lawsuits against CEZ Distribution, the company in charge of electricity distribution in Albania. 
Most complaints stem from unannounced energy cuts and poor supply, media in Tirana reported on Tuesday (December 21st). 
CEZ Distribution concedes that energy supplies do not meet the required standard but argues it needs more time to upgrade the system. 
CEZ privatised the only distribution system in the country at the beginning of 2009. 
Albanian Confindustry, an organisation representing local businesses, says there are 1,000 more companies that have been affected but are reluctant to file lawsuits against CEZ.

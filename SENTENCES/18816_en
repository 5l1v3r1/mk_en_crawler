ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN war crimes tribunal has decided to remove two defence lawyers representing Croatian General Ivan Cermak, who is facing charges stemming from crimes against ethnic Serb civilians during the controversial 1995 operation "Storm". 
Lawyers Cedo Prodanovic and Jadranka Slokovic said on Thursday (April 5th) that they were removed due to conflicts of interest. 
They plan to contest the ruling before the tribunal's Appeals Chamber.
Earlier this week, the tribunal announced that the trial against Cermak and co-defendants Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac would be delayed due to a number of unresolved issues.

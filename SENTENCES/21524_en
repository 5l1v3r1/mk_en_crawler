SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Authorities have demonstrated the political will to step up co-operation with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), spokesman Alessandro Buttice said on Monday (October 27th).
"It would be unfair to say the corruption problem does not exist in Bulgaria.
What's important is that Bulgarian authorities have pledged commitment to strengthening their co-operation with OLAF," Buttice said in an interview with Bulgarian National Television.
He stressed, however, that OLAF expects tangible results from Bulgaria's judiciary.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Foreign Minister Dragisa Burzan told local media on Sunday (6 July) that the government favours a bilateral agreement with the United States that would prevent extradition of both countries' nationals to the International Criminal Court.
"The position of Montenegro's diplomacy is that the US request is absolutely understandable and favours global stability," he said.
Officials in Belgrade had mixed reactions.
Dragoljub Micunovic, the speaker of the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament, said a decision by Montenegrin authorities would be unconstitutional, as the agreement would have to be made by the central government.
Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic, on the other hand, praised Burzan's statement.

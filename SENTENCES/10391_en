ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Authorities in Istanbul are considering imposing a "congestion tax" of the kind used in London, local media reported Saturday (20 November).
Motorists driving in the centre of the city would be required to pay a special tax.
Surveillance cameras would be used to ensure compliance with the measure.
In other news, former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned on Sunday that the EU should be careful when deciding on Turkey's bid for membership next month.
At a forum in Berlin, Kohl voiced concerns about the risk of overexpansion.

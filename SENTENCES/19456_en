PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Domestic courts should wrap up all war crimes-related trials by May 1st, Supreme Court Chairwoman Vesna Medenica said on Thursday (January 24th). 
She added that the courts should help investigators in such cases as well as step up international co-operation to meet the deadline. 
Medenica, who was recently appointed to the seat after serving as chief prosecutor, has also announced an ambitious programme to reform the justice system and address the huge backlog of cases involving corruption and organised crime.

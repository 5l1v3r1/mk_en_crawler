SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Voters headed to the polls on Sunday (May 20th) to elect the country's first members of the European Parliament (EP), after joining the EU on January 1st.
Surveys ahead of the vote put the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party in the lead with up to seven of Bulgaria's 18 seats in the EP.
Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development (GERB), a new centrist party established by Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov, is expected to win up to five seats.
The ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms will likely win three, and the Simeon II National Movement could get one or two.
The extreme nationalist Attack party was projected to get anywhere between one and three seats.
The once powerful conservative Union of Democratic Forces could at best hope for one seat.
The other newest EU member, Romania, is expected to elect its EP members in the fall.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Mostar-based NGO Croatia Libertas announced on Sunday (March 22nd) that it has filed suit against several Bosnian Muslim politicians and military leaders it accuses of war crimes. 
Croatia Libertas filed the lawsuits with the BiH prosecutor as well as with the Mostar cantonal prosecutor. 
The listed officials include BiH Presidency member Haris Silajdzic, who served as prime minister when the alleged war crimes took place, and current Defence Minister Selmo Cikotic. 
The lawsuits allege the Bosnian Muslim officials committed war crimes against 375 Croats held in detention camps and are based on documentary testimony published in the book "Muslim Concentration Camps for Croats 1991-1995 in BiH" by Ivica Mlivoncic. 
Croatia Libertas says it plans to file claims with the UN Human Rights Council to underscore problems with BiH's judiciary.

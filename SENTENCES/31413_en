ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Thursday (24 April), President Stipe Mesic denied press reports that new war crimes indictments have been issued against Croats.
He told reporters everything said is "just speculation".
Mesic admitted the UN tribunal in The Hague would issue indictments by the end of the year, but said prosecutors had not sent any information to Croatian authorities.
Also Thursday, the foreign ministry announced that Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Simonovic would represent the country Friday before the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Zagreb filed a lawsuit against the former Yugoslav Federation in July 1999, over damages incurred during the 1991-1995 Serbian-Croatian conflict.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Tuesday (November 4th) no agreement has been reached on the EU's new mission in Kosovo, EULEX.
Three parties, the Serbian Democratic Party, the New Serbia Party and the Serbian Radical Party, decided to launch a vote of no confidence against the cabinet for allegedly negotiating recognition of EULEX, which they consider de facto recognition of Kosovo's independence.
Jeremic stressed that differences remain, including over Belgrade's opposition to the Ahtisaari plan and its demand for a UN Security Council sanctioning EULEX.
The Security Council session on Kosovo, originally scheduled for this coming Friday, has been postponed till next Tuesday.
Andrew Ladley, UN envoy and chief mediator in talks between Serbia and Kosovo, has been in Belgrade for three days trying to find common ground.
In other news Tuesday, President Boris Tadic said Serbia would like to become an EU member between 2013 and 2015.
He told Czech Radio Zurnal that Serbia's two strategic goals are to maintain its territorial integrity and to join the EU.

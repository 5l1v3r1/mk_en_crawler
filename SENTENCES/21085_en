PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU's special representative to Kosovo, Pieter Feith, said on Saturday (March 1st) that Serbs in northern Kosovo will get neither a canton nor autonomy.
"This has not been planned and I have never discussed this with the Kosovo.
This is not the goal of the International Steering Group and not part of our plan," Feith added government.
"Our agenda gives Serbs special links, which include a transfer of funds from Belgrade, if necessary," he added.
Serbs in Kosovo can have only transparent ties to Belgrade, and Serb leaders in Kosovo must accept that, Feith said.
Separately, the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) said on Sunday there are no security threats in areas where about 260 Serb police officers have been suspended.
They turned in their weapons, radios and badges after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia last month.
The officers are refusing to obey their Albanian superiors at the KPS and say they will report only to UNMIK.

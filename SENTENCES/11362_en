ZUPCE, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serb protesters blocked the Zubin Potok-Mitrovica Highway in Kosovo for ten hours Sunday (24 July) following an overnight attack on Serb houses in the village of Zupce, according to local media reports. 
According to the chairman of the Zubin Potok municipality, Slavisa Ristic, shots were fired from the direction of the neighbouring Albanian village of Cabre, at a number of houses of Serbs in Zupce late the previous evening. 
A grenade was also thrown into the backyard of one of the houses. 
The incidents resulted in material damage, but no one was injured. 
Local Serbs protested the incidents by blocking the nearby motorway, but agreed to lift the blockade after UNMIK and the NATO-led Kosovo Force pledged to launch permanent checkpoints in the area. 
UNMIK police have started a probe into the incidents.

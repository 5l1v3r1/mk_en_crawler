TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi signed a decree Wednesday (January 14th) making June 28th the date for parliamentary elections. 
These will be the first since passage of the new election code, based more heavily on regional political preferences. 
The elections are considered crucial for Albania's aspirations to become a NATO member and to apply for EU candidate status.
In other news Wednesday, the Greek parliament ratified Albania's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
Opposition representatives had urged colleagues to wait until Albania recognises its Greek minority's rights.

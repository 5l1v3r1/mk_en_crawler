SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A report ordered by Bulgaria's new chief prosecutor Boris Velchev and released on Monday (12 June) cites numerous violations by prosecutors.
According to the document, senior prosecutors have frequently delayed selected trials for years, intervened in some cases, and applied pressure on lower level prosecutors.
Analysts say the findings are a clear signal that Velchev will be working to strengthen the judicial system, viewed as the weakest area in Bulgaria's EU bid.

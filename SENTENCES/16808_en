TIRANA, Albania -- With three new members of the Central Election Commission -- Fatmir Kumbaro, Flamur Cato and Arben Ristani â sworn on Friday (4 August), all seven seats have now been filled. 
There had been vacancies since spring. 
The full panel must scramble now to prepare for local elections that will be held in December or January.
On Saturday, meanwhile, Transport Minister Lulzim Basha urged the Socialist-led opposition to accept negotiations with the ruling Democratic Party to end squabbling that has affected parliament's work for months. 
The wrangling has delayed reforms that are crucial to eventual EU integration.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said Romania might finalise EU accession negotiations by closing the remaining three chapters within a couple of weeks.
Speaking Sunday (31 October), he said discussions on the Justice and Internal Affairs chapter -- one of the most difficult -- were likely to be completed this week.
Romania must finalise accession talks with the EU by the end of this year in order to join during 2007.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government decided on Tuesday (January 15th) to restrict electricity exports, in light of increased domestic demand triggered by a cold snap.
Economy and Energy Minister Petar Dimitrov imposed a total ban on exports until the end of this week, and limited the amount until the end of March.
Extreme cold during the past two weeks resulted in 20% higher energy consumption than in the same period last year.

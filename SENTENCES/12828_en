PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- During her visit to Podgorica on Wednesday (2 February), chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte called on local authorities to co-operate more actively with The Hague. 
She said fugitive indictees were moving around the region -- including Montenegro -- and urged better control over the border between Montenegro and Republika Srpska. 
Del Ponte then travelled on to Brussels for a meeting Thursday with High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina Paddy Ashdown and EU security chief Javier Solana.

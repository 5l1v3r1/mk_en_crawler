SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Organisers say farmers plan to block the Vinjani Donji border crossing with Croatia on Monday (2 February), to protest the BiH government's failure to sign agreements with Croatia on veterinary and sanitary protection. 
That resulted in Croatian authorities refusing to allow lorries carrying BiH food products to enter Croatia.
In other news, Moody's Investor Service is expected to issue BiH's first sovereign credit rating in April. 
The Central Bank of BiH says experts from Moody's visited BiH last week and held a series of meetings with government officials, international representatives, journalists and members of the business community.

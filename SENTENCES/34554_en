BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu has called on Romanians to participate in the national referendum on 19 October and vote in favour of the new constitution, which has been drafted in line with European standards. 
In a special statement on national TV Thursday (2 October), Iliescu said the issue was of the utmost importance for the future of the country.
Also Thursday, authorities ordered a 12-year-old Roma girl and her 15-year-old common-law husband separated until they are old enough to be legally married. 
The order came from social welfare services in the city of Sibiu, where the two were declared married Saturday in a ceremony that sparked a national debate.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk is this year's Nobel laureate in literature, the Swedish Academy announced Thursday (October 12th). 
"In the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city, [Pamuk] has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures," the Academy said Earlier this year, he faced charges for "insulting Turkishness" in one novel, though the case was later dropped amid EU pressure.

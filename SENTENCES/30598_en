TIRANA, Albania -- Transparency International (TI) on Monday (March 14th) praised the weekend arrests of 11 traders and officials linked to an illegal oil smuggling scheme. 
The TI representative in Albania, Lutfi Dervishi, said the scheme confirms that some institutions in the country do not function, as it should have been exposed by fuel quality inspectors, the tax office, customs or the police. 
Still unclear is how much damage has been done, ranging from the fraud itself to the damage done to vehicles and the environment. 
The 11 suspects are accused of allowing two companies to sell local oil as if it was high quality imported diesel from 2007 to 2009. 
Former Energy Minister Dritan Prifti hinted of the fraud last year.

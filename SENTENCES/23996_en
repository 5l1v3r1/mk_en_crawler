ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police chief Vladimir Faber on Thursday (June 18th) confirmed reports that he has been removed from his post for failing to prevent last week's farmers' protest in downtown Zagreb. 
A formal announcement is expected after Prime Minister Ivo Sanader returns from an EU meeting in Brussels.
In other news Thursday, businessman Miroslav Kutle was arrested near the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Local media speculated that he tried to flee the country after a Zagreb regional court sentenced him to three years in prison for corruption, stemming from illegal privatisation deals that reportedly netted him millions of euros.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Monday (August 27th) that party will submit a vote of no confidence against the government on September 10th.
The text will criticise the general performance of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's cabinet.
So far, the ruling National Liberal Party appears unwilling to negotiate with the PSD.
However, a junior government ally, the Hungarian Democratic Union, announced it would meet with the Social Democrats on Saturday to discuss the motion.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party's (PSD) executive committee decided on Wednesday (September 19th) to submit a vote of no confidence against the government of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu next Monday, PSD leader Mircea Geoana said.
Later in the day, he met with President Traian Basescu, who also met with Democratic Party (PD) leader Emil Boc with an eye to a possible PSD-PD government.
Sources say Geoana backs the idea, but the PD doesn't.
In other news Wednesday, Basescu gave the National Anti-Corruption Office (DNA) permission to launch an investigation against former Defence Minister Victor Babiuc, who is accused of bribery and abuse of power.
He is one of several former officials the DNA wants to investigate over a series of questionable transactions.

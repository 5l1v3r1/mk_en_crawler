STRASBOURG, France -- The latest monitoring report by the Council of Europe (CoE) on BiH acknowledges a significant shift in attitudes towards co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The report, which appeared on the CoE Web site Tuesday (26 April), assesses the fulfilment of post-accession commitments by BiH. 
It notes in particular the change in Republika Srpska's approach towards its war crimes obligations. 
This has created conditions for significant progress in BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration bids, the report said.
Also Tuesday, local media reported that leaders of the main BiH political powers have agreed on principles for police reform -- a key requirement for a positive EU Feasibility Study. 
Closed-door negotiations among the parties have been under way in Vlasic for days.

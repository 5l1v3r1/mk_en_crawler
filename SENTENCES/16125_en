SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU warned BiH on Thursday (15 June) that stalled police reform and delayed adoption of several important laws could imperil the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations.
Reinhard Priebe, head of the European Commission Western Balkans Office, criticised Republika Srpska for backing out of the police reform agreement.
BiH has also delayed the adoption of legislation in areas such as banking supervision, insurance, leasing and pharmaceuticals.
Priebe advised BiH institutions to be more dynamic and said that parliament could not allow itself to slow down its work due to the upcoming October elections.
BiH authorities hope to have the SAA signed by the end of this year.

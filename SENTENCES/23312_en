BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors indicted former Economy Minister Codrut Seres and former Communication and IT Minister Zsolt Nagy on Monday (March 30th) over their alleged involvement in illegal privatisation deals.
Seres is accused of treason and provision of classified commercial information related to the sale of state-owned companies.
Nagy is charged with allowing the leak of classified information and facilitating illegal privatisation deals.
Four other suspects, including a Czech and a Turkish citizen, received indictments in the same case.
Prosecutors say that between May 2005 and November 2006, the defendants were part of a criminal group that organised improper privatisations, including that of Romanian power distributor Electrica, aircraft maker Avioane Craiova, telecom operator Romtelecom and postal company Posta Romana.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Institute of Romania (IER) released 12 studies Wednesday (28 July) on the impact EU accession would have on the country. 
The studies analyse monetary policy and exchange rate strategies, European security and defence policies, migration and immigration, structural funds, the action plan for storage of industrial waste, and the degree of harmonisation between Romanian and EU legislation, as well as the experiences of applicant countries. 
Jonathan Scheele, head of the European Commission delegation to Romania, commended the IER initiative, saying it would be very helpful to the government's integration efforts.

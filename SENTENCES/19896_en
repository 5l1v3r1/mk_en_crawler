BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers expressed deep concern over the deteriorating political environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in a statement issued after their meeting Monday (November 19th) in Brussels. 
The ministers urged political leaders to stop undermining the state and to instead enable it to function better and to proceed with reforms. 
They praised the police reform declaration made by the major parties on October 28th in Mostar and urged leaders to implement it. 
In other news, Portuguese Defence Minister Nuno Severiano Teixeira, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said that EU peacekeepers in the Althea mission would remain in BiH as long as necessary since their presence is key to the preservation of regional stability.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) again called for swift reforms Tuesday (12 October) in the statistical sector in BiH. 
At a news conference, OHR spokesman Kevin Sullivan said BiH authorities should implement measures to improve the system of gathering and reporting statistical information to overcome systemic inadequacies.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The International Crisis Group (ICG) plans to withdraw from BiH at the end of this year or early in 2005, according to its Bosnian representative, Senad Slatina.
In a statement issued Sunday (7 November), Slatina said the decision was not linked to budgetary considerations.
Rather, he said, it reflects progress made in the stabilisation process and the shifting of ICG's attention to other crisis areas.

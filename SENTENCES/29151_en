SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (October 6th) voted to make Stefan Konstantinov, deputy chairman of the medical union, the country's new health minister.
He replaces Anna-Maria Borissova, who resigned last week amid heavy criticism of planned reforms in the sector.
Assessing the current state of the system, Konstantinov said that the biggest problem is inadequate supervision, which leads to higher costs and accumulating debt.
He described his short-term priority as optimising the health care network, including designating priority hospitals that will receive preferential state funding.
The possible introduction of client payments will also be discussed.
Longer-term priorities include raising salary levels and securing more state financing in order to improve the quality of health care services.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki says Macedonia's feud with Greece concerns not only the country's name but also the national identity of the Macedonian people.
His statement Thursday (April 16th) was in response to one Monday by Greek Ambassador to the United States Alexandros Mallias, who described the proposed name "Northern Republic of Macedonia" as a good base for resolving the name dispute.
"A statement from a Greek ambassador or the will of the Greek government cannot affect how a state, a nation will determine the main features of its sovereignty, including the name," Milososki replied.

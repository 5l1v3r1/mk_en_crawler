PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US troops handed over management of the borderline between Kosovo and Macedonia to the Kosovo Police on Monday (March 29th). 
KFOR said this proves the commitment and willingness of the police to take on greater responsibility for providing security to Kosovo citizens. 
The hand-over comes as NATO considers downsizing the number of KFOR personnel.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament on Wednesday (9 October) rejected a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ivica Racan that had been filed last month by the opposition Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
The party argued that Racan violated the constitution when he signed a preliminary border agreement with Slovenia last year. 
The opposition considers the agreement inconsistent with the interests of the country and described it as a "trade with national territory". 
After heated debate, HDZ left Wednesday's parliamentary session. 
The no-confidence motion gained only a single vote.
In other news, the war crimes court at The Hague on Wednesday published Croatia's latest request concerning the indictment and arrest warrant against retired Gen Janko Bobetko. 
The government submitted the document last week, asking the tribunal to revise its facts, given what it called incorrect allegations about the Medak Pocket operation in September 1993. 
Prosecutors at The Hague called it an illegal action aimed at accomplishing criminal goals. 
Zagreb insists that the two-day military and police operation there was to establish sovereignty and prevent terrorist attacks.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The retrial of five Bulgarian nurses accused of infecting children with HIV in Libya has been scheduled for 11 May, the foreign ministry announced on Saturday (22 April).
The nurses were sentenced to death two years ago despite evidence that poor hygiene at the hospital was to blame for the outbreak.
The Libyan Supreme Court later overturned the convictions, ordering a retrial.
The United States and the EU have called on Tripoli to free the nurses.

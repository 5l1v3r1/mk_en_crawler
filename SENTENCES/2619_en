The Albanian police and UNMIK pledged on Thursday (12 January) to co-ordinate activities against organised crime in Albania and Kosovo.
The agreement came at a meeting in Tirana between Albanian Police Director Bajram Ibraj and a UNMIK delegation headed by Commissioner Kai Vittrup.
"Organised crime in Albania and Kosovo can be prevented and tackled only through good co-ordination of police actions, and also with the intensive exchange of information, regarding the criminal elements or groups that are wanted by the justice systems of Albania and Kosovo," the participants said in a statement.
Albania and Kosovo are used by local and regional criminal groups for trafficking in weapons, people and narcotics, or as a shelter for those fleeing legal action, Ibraj and Vittrup noted.
According to the two officials, co-operation is especially needed in securing borders, training police forces, ballistics parameters, and examination of documents.
"The new agreement covers issues connected with eliminating the criminal groups, fighting against narcotics trafficking;
illegal trafficking in general, arresting wanted persons and also the improvement of the services in the border checkpoints," Ibraj said.
The Tirana talks also saw the signing of a twinning agreement between the Albanian police academy "Arben Zylyftari" and the Police Service School of Kosovo.
According to Albanian Interior Minister Sokol Olldashi, "weakness of law enforcement is one of the main problems that Albania and other countries in our region face.
This weakness has created a convenient space for organised crime and trans-border trafficking."
Albanian authorities have taken a number of recent steps to enhance the fight against organised crime, including overhauling the Directorate of Organised Crime and proposing special task forces.

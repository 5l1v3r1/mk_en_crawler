THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The referral bench of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague held a hearing Thursday (12 May) on a prosecutor's motion to refer the trial of three Yugoslav Army officers charged in the Ovcara massacre to Croatia or Serbia-Montenegro. 
Both countries presented arguments for taking over the trial. 
Lawyers for Croatia focused on the legal aspects of the case and the readiness of the local judiciary to handle war crimes trials. 
Serbia-Montenegro lawyers in turn criticised the Croatian judiciary and insisted a fair and impartial trial could be guaranteed only in Belgrade. 
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte raised the possibility of transferring the case in February.

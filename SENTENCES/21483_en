BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Western Balkans top the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign ministers that opens Monday (May 26th) in Brussels. 
The ministers will review developments in Serbia and are likely to express support for formation of a government committed to EU integration that will lead Serbia towards EU candidate status. 
The ministers will also review the situation in Kosovo and the progress of the deployment of the EU police and judicial mission there (namely, EULEX). 
While a delay of the deployment until after June 15th is likely, the deadline by which the EU was to take over responsibilities from the UN, observers expect no new word on a time frame.
Separately Monday, Brussels is hosting a two-day parliamentary forum to promote regional co-operation in the EU integration process. 
European Parliament President Hans-Gert Pottering and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn will address the forum.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Members of the international Contact Group plan to meet in Moscow on Friday (April 20th) in an attempt to reach an agreement on UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for Kosovo.
International news agencies quoted Western diplomats as saying that the EU and the United States will try to persuade Russia to accept the blueprint as the only viable solution.
A second meeting of the group, which consists of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, is scheduled for next Wednesday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Belgrade on Thursday.
Following talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic, he said Moscow, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, supports Serbia's position and wants to see continued UN-mediated negotiations between Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians.
China, another permanent member, issued a similar statement Wednesday.
In other news, details are emerging about the deaths of two ethnic Albanian protesters during a pro-independence demonstration in Pristina in February.
A preliminary report says the protesters were killed by Italian-made RB1-rubber bullets fired by Romanian riot police at close range.
Investigators say that the rubber had hardened over the years, turning the bullets into lethal weapons.
The ammunition, manufactured in 1991, had a shelf life of just three years.

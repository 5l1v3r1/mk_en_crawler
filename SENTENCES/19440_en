ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the rival Social Democratic Party (SDP) led by Zoran Milanovic, raced on Monday (November 26th) to line up enough support in parliament to form a cabinet. 
With nearly all of the votes counted, the HDZ appears set to win 61 seats, plus five more from the votes of Croats living in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
The SDP chose not to run there, arguing that only those who live in Croatia should be allowed to vote.
The HDZ is still short of the majority it needs in the 153-seat parliament and is busy negotiating with representatives of ethnic minorities and a small centrist party. 
The SDP refuses to concede defeat, despite receiving only 56 seats. 
They have secured the support of 68 lawmakers and are looking for nine more. 
On Monday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Sunday's elections complied with international standards. 
He urged the new government to implement criteria necessary for EU accession.
In other news, a suspected war criminal has been elected to parliament. 
Branimir Glavas, who awaits trial for the abduction, murder and torture of 12 Serbs in Osijek, won a seat Sunday. 
His party, the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja, says the win gives him immunity from prosecution.

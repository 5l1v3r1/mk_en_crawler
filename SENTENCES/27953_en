TIRANA, Albania -- Police prevented a movie-style robbery Wednesday (September 22nd) when they discovered a tunnel being constructed near a Tirana bank. 
Authorities arrested the two alleged masterminds, who had rented a shop near the bank and purportedly began digging the tunnel four months ago. 
The target was a branch of Intesa San Paolo bank. 
Police found radios, cameras and other equipment the suspects stored in the shop.

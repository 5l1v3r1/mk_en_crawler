BAGHDAD, Iraq -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said on Saturday (June 9th) that it has submitted a protest note to Turkey over alleged shelling in northern Iraq. 
Baghdad says the Turkish military conducted around three hours of shelling on late Wednesday and early Thursday, causing damage in the provinces of Dahuk and Arbil, and traumatizing local residents. 
The ministry called for urgent talks with Ankara, warning that bilateral ties were in jeopardy. 
No comment has yet come from Turkey. 
Earlier this week, the Turkish government and military denied reports of a limited incursion into northern Iraq. 
It allegedly targeted bases of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party.

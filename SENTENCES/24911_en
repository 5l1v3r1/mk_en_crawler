BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic of the ruling Democratic Party (DS) on Sunday (March 1st) again rejected the possibility of early elections this year. 
Speaking at the DS Steering Committee session, Tadic stressed that 2009 was not a year for elections and economic growth but rather a time to preserve national, economic and state capacities. 
He stressed that elections would only burden the economy and delay the economic reform agenda as Serbia grapples with the world economic crisis. 
Tadic urged the opposition to act constructively and to support implementation of an anti-crisis package approved by the government. 
The opposition has instead called repeatedly for early elections.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Early turnout appears strong in Sunday's (February 3rd) presidential run-off between incumbent Boris Tadic and ultra-nationalist Tomislav Nikolic. 
Analysts the race is too tight to call in this second round. 
Nikolic won the first round on January 20th by about 5% over Tadic. 
The race has been cast as a roadmap to the future. 
Tadic wants to lead the country to eventual EU membership, while Nikolic insists on closer ties with Russia. 
Both agree that Kosovo must remain part of sovereign Serbian territory.

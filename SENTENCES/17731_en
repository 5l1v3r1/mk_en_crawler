NEW YORK, United States -- The Western sponsors of a new draft resolution on Kosovo announced on Friday (July 20th) that they will not put the text to a vote in the UN Security Council. 
Russia has already rejected the document. 
The sponsors -- the United States, Britain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and France â are instead transferring the issue of Kosovo's future to the existing Contact Group, of which Russia is a member. 
There are plans to allow another 120 days of talks between Belgrade and Pristina -- with mediation by the Contact Group -- before deciding what to do next.
Both Russia and Serbia praised the move, while Kosovo's Prime Minister Agim Ceku described the UN's attempts to resolve the crisis as a "failure". 
He has suggested the Kosovo Assembly may declare independence on November 28th.

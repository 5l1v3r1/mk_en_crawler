BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica announced Thursday (14 November) that he would run for president of Serbia in the 8 December election. 
He said in a written statement that he made the decision because his republic "needs democracy and reform." He also urged all pro-reform parties to support him as they did in the Yugoslav presidential elections two years ago. 
The ruling DOS coalition signalled Wednesday that it could support him, though an official says two of the 17-member parties likely will not comply. 
Ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj is the only other announced candidate.

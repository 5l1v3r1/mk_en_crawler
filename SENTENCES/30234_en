JERUSALEM, Israel -- The Foreign Ministry expressed concern Wednesday (April 13th) over a Turkish humanitarian organisation's plans to send another aid flotilla to Gaza next month. 
"[Israeli] Ambassador [to Ankara Gabby Levy] told his Turkish counterparts of our concerns about the dispatching of a pro-Hamas flotilla in the coming months," ministry spokesperson Yigal Palmor said. 
According to reports, the humanitarian organisation Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) is planning a large flotilla to mark the anniversary of last year's Israeli-led raid. 
Six vessels were boarded by Israeli commandos on May 31st 2010, resulting in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. 
The lead vessel in this year's flotilla is again expected to be the Mavi Marmara, which will be accompanied by 15 ships and nearly 1,000 activists from different countries. 
Media reported that Israel has asked Turkey to help stop the flotilla.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 200 police officers rallied outside the parliament building in Bucharest on Tuesday (May 17th) protesting government plans to slash jobs in the sector. 
Labour unions oppose particularly a draft that envisions cutting 9,500 positions and eliminating many employee benefits. 
The protestors insist the draft violates a public order strategy adopted by the government last year. 
The protest ended earlier than planned after lawmakers postponed debate on the controversial bill.

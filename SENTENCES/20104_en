ATHENS, Greece -- Voters headed for the polls on Sunday (September 16th) for early parliamentary elections. 
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called the snap vote in a bid to gain a stronger mandate for planned reforms. 
However, the campaign has been overshadowed by wildfires that swept through parts of the country in August, killing scores of people and causing massive destruction.
Polls now show the ruling New Democracy party with a narrow lead over its main rival, George Papandreou's PASOK. 
Neither party is likely to win the clear majority needed to form a government on its own.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Ministry spokesperson Burak Ozugergin said on Thursday (April 22nd) that Ankara is analysing a statement by Armenia's parliamentary majority, suggesting that the issue of normalising ties with Turkey should be removed from the institution's agenda until Turkey agrees to negotiate without preconditions and in a reasonable timeframe. 
In a joint statement, ruling coalition members -- the Republican Party of Armenia, Orinats Yerkir and Prosperous Armenia -- said that it considers Turkey's position on the issue "unacceptable".
"We are evaluating the content of this [Armenian] statement and what it means" legally and politically, Turkey's Ozugergin said. 
The two protocols on establishing diplomatic ties and re-opening the border between the two countries were signed in October. 
However, their ratification by the two parliaments has dragged over the so-called Armenian "genocide" issue and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan in its dispute with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- According to final results released on Sunday (January 30th), incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) won the December 12th snap parliamentary elections with 32.11% of the votes.
The Central Election Commission (CEC) says the Democratic League of Kosovo was second with 24.69%, the Vetevendosje movement followed with 12.69%, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo was fourth with 11.04%, and the coalition around the New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) got 7.29%.
Turnout was 45.29%.
The process was marred by irregularities, which made the CEC order a revote in several municipalities.
The election results are expected to be certified on Monday if no party complains.
The PDK has already started informal negotiations to form the new government.
Talks with the AKR and most minority parties may soon net an agreement.
The rest of the parties have rejected the idea of joining the government, opting to form a strong opposition.

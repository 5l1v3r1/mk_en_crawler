HELSINKI, Finland -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte warned on Friday (29 September) that top war crimes fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic might never face justice, if the UN does not extend the tribunal's mandate beyond 2008.
The same day, she met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Helsinki.
Rehn said afterwards that there has been no sign of improved Serbian co-operation with the tribunal, and thus there is no basis for resuming Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Belgrade.

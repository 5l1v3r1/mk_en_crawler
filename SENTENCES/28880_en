LONDON, United Kingdom -- Retired Bosnian Serb General Radislav Krstic, convicted in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, was assaulted on Friday (May 7th) by three fellow inmates at a high-security prison in the United Kingdom, where he is serving his sentence. 
Prison guards found Krstic, 62, bleeding and unconscious, and immediately transferred him to a hospital. 
His life is not in danger, doctors said.
In 2001, the UN war crimes tribunal (ICTY) found Krstic guilty of genocide committed in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica and sentenced him to 46 years in prison. 
An ICTY appeals chamber reduced his sentence to 35 years in 2004.

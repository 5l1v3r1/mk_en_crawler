LONDON, United Kingdom -- All Balkan countries should become members of the EU, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov said on Friday (November 19th) during a roundtable organised by the London School of Economics.
According to him, the EU membership would help prevent new wars in the region and would strengthen the position of those who oppose nationalism and want to reform the countries they live in, in a democratic way.
The discussion was also attended by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who reiterated that his country's future is in the EU.

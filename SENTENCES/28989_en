BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic confirmed on Monday (November 8th) that former military intelligence head Aco Tomic is under investigation for helping Bosnian Serb wartime military commander Ratko Mladic avoid arrest. 
Blic daily has reported that Tomic is being investigated for allegedly helping to shelter Mladic at two military facilities in Serbia in 2006. 
Mladic has been on the run since 1995, shortly after the UN war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has granted early release to former senior Bosnian Serb officer Milan Gvero, who was sentenced this month to five years in prison for crimes against humanity committed in Srebrenica in 1995, media reported on Tuesday (June 29th).
In making the decision, the tribunal took into consideration Gvero's poor health.
On June 16th, he requested early release, noting he has spent more than four years in detention, or more than two thirds of his sentence.
A close aide of wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, Gvero surrendered to the tribunal in 2005.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso urged Romania on Monday (January 12th) to demonstrate concrete results in reforming the judiciary and fighting corruption.
Romania must convince fellow EU members that it can fulfil its obligations, Barroso told a press conference after meeting with Romanian President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc in Brussels.
He also urged Bucharest to boost its capacity to absorb EU structural funds.
However, he praised Romania for being "a highly active member" of the EU since its accession in 2007 and for playing "a crucial part" in the region.
In other news Monday, Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party withdrew its support of Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea, reportedly after he appointed four state secretaries without party approval.
Deputy Prime Minister Dan Nica might become interim interior minister.

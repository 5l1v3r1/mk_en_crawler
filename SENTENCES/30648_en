BELGRADE, Serbia â The human rights watchdog Amnesty International urged authorities in Belgrade on Thursday (April 7th) to halt the forced evictions of Roma and to provide them with adequate housing.
In a report issued on the eve of the International Roma Day on Friday, the organisation said that "instead of halting forced evictions, the Serbian authorities in Belgrade are carrying out more and more, driving Roma communities from their homes." It recommended "guaranteeing Roma the right to housing provided with sanitation, within reach of public facilities and employment and secure from future forced evictions".
According to the report, many of these evictions stem from a 2009 Belgrade Assembly plan which envisions large-scale infrastructure projects funded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank.
There are an estimated 500,000 Roma living in Serbia -- roughly 7% of the population.

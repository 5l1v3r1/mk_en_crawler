BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Nearly two weeks after the Montenegrin independence referendum, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica remains reluctant to say whether he will recognise the outcome and congratulate Podgorica authorities, according to local media reports.
At a news conference Thursday (1 June), Kostunica did say his government acknowledged the Montenegrin Republican Referendum Commission's ruling on the poll's success.
He further stressed that it was time Serbia starts dealing with its own affairs.
Meanwhile, EU security chief Javier Solana visits Belgrade on Friday for talks with Kostunica, President Boris Tadic and Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic.
Issues related to post-referendum ties with Montenegro, Serbia's EU bid and Kosovo status talks are expected to dominate the agenda.

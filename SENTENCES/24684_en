BUCHAREST, Romania -- By a vote of 158-128, lawmakers Wednesday (March 4th) decided to allow prosecutors to launch a criminal investigation of fellow parliament member Adrian Nastase of the Social Democratic Party. 
The former prime minister faces charges of taking bribes and forging official documents in connection with acquiring his current home, worth an estimated 1.5m euros. 
The judicial committee of the Deputies' Chamber rejected the same request in early February but was acting only in an advisory capacity. 
The actual decision rested with the full chamber of deputies. 
No earlier criminal investigation of Nastase was able to overcome procedural issues.

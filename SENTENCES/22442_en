ANKARA, Turkey -- Six teenagers face sentences of up to 23 years in prison for terrorism after allegedly participating in Kurdish separatist protests last month, according to court documents published on Thursday (November 13th). 
The teenagers, all 13 or 14 years old, face charges of committing crimes in the name of a terrorist organisation, transmitting terrorist propaganda and destroying public property in connection with violent protests that accompanied Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Diyarbakir in October. 
Their trial is proceeding in a juvenile court, but they face the same punishment as adults.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The teachers' strike entered into its fourth week Monday (October 15th) after weekend talks between teachers' unions and the government failed, despite compromises from both sides. 
The cabinet sweetened its offer, suggesting wage hikes of at least 33.1% by the end of 2008, including a 10% hike this year and two more in 2008. 
In addition, teachers that meet certain performance criteria will receive up to a 45.5% increase in wages next year. 
The unions dropped their demand for a 95% wage hike, demanding instead 72.8% in a series of three hikes. 
This would require far more spending on education in the budget, another union demand.

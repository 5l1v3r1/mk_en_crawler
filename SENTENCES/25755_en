BELGRADE, Serbia -- Dutch Ambassador to Belgrade Ron Van Dartel said on Monday (September 21st) that his country continues to insist on Serbia's full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
He added that the arrest of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic will be genuine proof of local authorities' willingness to meet their obligations.
Van Dartel reiterated that Mladic's arrest remains the key condition for allowing implementation of the interim trade agreement between Serbia and the EU, as part of the broader pre-membership agreement.
Serbia signed its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in April 2008, but the Netherlands has been opposing its enforcement ever since, insisting on Mladic's arrest first.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeated on Friday (24 December) that his government is committed to finding a solution to the Cyprus problem. 
He reiterated that a UN-sponsored plan for reunification of the divided island should be used as the basis. 
Erdogan said that the plan -- backed by Cypriot Turks but rejected by Cypriot Greeks during a referendum earlier this year -- could be revised. 
However, any revised plan should be subject to a new vote, he said.
Also Friday, the justice ministers of Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a deal that will pave the way for a formal bilateral agreement in 2005 on legal collaboration.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) went before the Constitutional Court on Friday (January 30th), to challenge the new lustration law, which parliament passed in December.
It requires all officials to undergo investigation to determine whether they co-operated with the communist-era secret services.
The SP says the bill violates both the constitution and human rights.
The Socialists and smaller opposition parties boycotted the vote in December, arguing the law was politically motivated and designed to help the ruling Democratic Party sideline rivals in the general elections this June.
The US, the UK and the EU have all expressed concern over the legislation as well.

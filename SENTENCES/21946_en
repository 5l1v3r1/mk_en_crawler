NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias denied speculation Tuesday (October 21st) that he will walk out of direct talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat aimed at reunifying the divided island.
The president, however, warned that any attempt to exert pressure on him would bring about the opposite effect.
Christofias reiterated support for abolishing the notion of guarantor status, held by the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey concerning the island.
"It is unnatural for a modern country to have foreign guarantors or custodians," he said.
The 1960 constitution stipulates that the three countries are guarantor powers of the country's independence and territorial integrity.
The Turkish Cypriot side insists on the preservation of Ankara's guarantees in any future agreement on reunification.
Christofias and Talat meet again in Nicosia on Wednesday for their latest round of direct talks.

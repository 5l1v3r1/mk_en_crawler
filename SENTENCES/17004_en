The Croatian government on Friday (1 September) appealed to the UN war crime tribunal in The Hague (ICTY), requesting the status of amicus curiae (friend of the court) in procedures conducted against three Croatian Army generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac.
The same status was asked in the ICTY trial of six war-time Bosnian Croat military officials and politicians.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said that in the capacity of friends of the court, the state would be able to challenge things that it finds unacceptable.

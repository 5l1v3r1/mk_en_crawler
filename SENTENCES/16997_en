BUCHAREST, Romania -- There will be no changes in the cabinet despite differences among the ministers over the future of the military mission in Iraq. 
The leaders of the ruling Liberal Party voted on Monday (3 July) that Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu and Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu should keep their posts, despite their opposition to Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's pullout plan. 
The idea was rejected by the country's Security Council, chaired by President Traian Basescu, a strong supporter of Romania's continued participation in the Iraq coalition.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Satisfaction with local institutions has dropped in the first months of this year, according to the UNDP's latest Early Warning Report, published on Friday (May 15th). 
Also taking a beating is the credibility of international organisations. 
Only EULEX bucks the trend and has seen its credibility grow over the review period.
In other news Friday, the interior ministry decided to stop paying salaries to suspended Serb members of the Kosovo police. 
The move came 15 months after they quit their jobs to protest Pristina's unilateral declaration of independence in February 2008. 
"About 30 Serb police officers returned to their jobs; however, starting Saturday, more than 300 Serb police officers will be on unpaid suspension," Kosovo police spokesperson Arber Beka said. 
The police department will hold the jobs only until June 30th.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Local newspapers reported Monday (15 December) that Osama bin Laden personally issued the orders for the four November bombings in Istanbul.
Citing sources close to the investigation, the media said two Turkish men visited Afghanistan at an unspecified time to plan the attacks.
This information was revealed to a special state security court by Feyzi Yigit, the man who allegedly made the bombs that killed 62 people.
He told the judge that bin Laden's recommended targets were abandoned when terrorists discovered that they were too difficult to attack.
The group eventually settled for two synagogues, the British Consulate General, and the HSBC bank.
Yigit admitted that he received training in Afghanistan in 1994 and says the four suicide bombers, all Turkish nationals, also trained there.

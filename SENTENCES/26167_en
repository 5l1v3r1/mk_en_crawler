BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court announced on Monday (December 14th) the results of the presidential election, confirming incumbent Traian Basescu's victory over rival Mircea Geoana of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). 
The announcement followed a recount of just over 2,000 votes previously deemed invalid. 
It didn't change the results however: Basescu of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) beat Geoana by a hair -- just 0.74%.
Meanwhile, the National Liberal Party (PNL) tapped leader Crin Antonescu to serve as prime minister, should the party participate in a coalition government. 
Still unclear however is whether the coalition would involve the PSD or the PDL. 
Geoana's PSD says it is prepared to have Antonescu head up the next government. 
The PDL on the other hand is close to signing a coalition with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, a smaller party representing the ethnic Hungarian minority. 
The PDL would still need the PNL in its corner to form a stable government.

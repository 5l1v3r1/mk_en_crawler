PAZARDZHIK, Bulgaria -- The trial of an Islamic fundamentalist preacher, Ahmed Musa, begins at the Pazardzhik regional court on Monday (1 November).
Ahmed and other two members of the Halifat Islamic organisation were arrested last year in Pazardzhik's Roma quarter and charged with preaching radical Islam to the Muslim Roma minority as well as organising activities against the Bulgarian state.

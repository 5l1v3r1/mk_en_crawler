PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier has been appointed the key official to report to the UN on future dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
Zannier has informed EU Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton about the mission's role, as well as the assistance offered by the UN representative in Belgrade, Andrew Gilmour.
UNMIK officials in Pristina told BBC's Albanian service on Saturday (December 4th) that Zannier will help co-ordinate -- with the EU -- to establish dialogue between the two sides in order to promote regional peace, security and sustainability.
On Sunday, outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reacted, saying that Kosovo is an independent country and nobody is needed to mediate talks.
In September, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on Belgrade and Pristina to engage in a dialogue of mutual interest.
No start date has been set.

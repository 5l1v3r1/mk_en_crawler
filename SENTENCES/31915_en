SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Members of the European and Bulgarian parliaments will visit the Kozloduy nuclear power plant Monday (28 October). 
The move precedes the 15th meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee. 
The Bulgarian government recently agreed to close the third and fourth units in 2006 as required by the European Commission, on condition it sends experts to review the plant's safety. 
President Georgi Parvanov insists on a peer review with the co-operation of the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as possible.

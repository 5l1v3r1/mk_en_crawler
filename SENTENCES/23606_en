ANKARA, Turkey -- An Istanbul criminal court has asked prosecutors investigating the shadowy secularist group Ergenekon to look at a possible connection to the 2007 murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, media reported on Tuesday (January 27th). 
The court wants prosecutors to examine the phone conversations and bank accounts of Colonel Ali Oz, who was in charge of the provincial gendarmerie in the city of Trabzon when a gunman shot Dink. 
Oz and former intelligence office director Lieutenant Metin Yildiz have undergone investigation for neglecting their duties before Dink's murder outside his newspaper's office in Istanbul on January 19th 2007. 
The Ergenekon group allegedly planned to incite chaos to trigger a coup against the Justice and Development Party's government.

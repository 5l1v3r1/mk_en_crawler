SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament approved on Wednesday (April 21st) Anna-Maria Borissova's nomination as the new health minister, backed by lawmakers from the ruling Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), Attack and the Blue Coalition. 
Borissova takes up the post vacated by Bozhidar Nanev, who resigned after prosecutors indicted him in connection with medicine supply deals that cost the country about 1.75m euros in losses.
In other news Wednesday, parliament over-rode President Georgi Parvanov's veto of changes to the penal procedure code. 
GERB and the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria insist the changes will ensure a more efficient judicial process, but the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party plans to challenge them before the Constitutional Court.

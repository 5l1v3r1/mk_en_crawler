ANKARA, Turkey -- Eleven people, including four police officers, were injured on Sunday (November 22nd) in clashes during a pro-Kurdish demonstration in Izmir. 
The rally was organised to welcome Ahmet Turk, leader of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). 
Izmir residents attacked DTP supporters as they walked down the city's streets carrying flags of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
The situation escalated when a vehicle driven by a demonstrator struck a passer-by. 
Security forces fired gunshots in the air and local residents started throwing stones at the protestors. 
Izmir has a large Kurdish community.

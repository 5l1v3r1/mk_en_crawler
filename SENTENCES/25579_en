BELGRADE, Serbia -- State prosecutor Slobodan Radovanovic will ask the Constitutional Court on Friday (September 25th) to ban the ultranationalist groups Obraz (Honour) and the Serb Popular Movement 1389.
He explained on Thursday that the groups incite hatred, xenophobia, and homophobia and are intolerant of those who do not share their religion and values.
The two groups bitterly opposed the Gay Pride parade that was to be held in Belgrade last Sunday.
It was eventually cancelled due to threats by extremists.

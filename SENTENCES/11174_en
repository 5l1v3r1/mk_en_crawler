BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The main political powers in Republika Srpska (RS) reached a deal Saturday (25 December) on settling the institutional crisis in the entity. 
According to a joint statement by the leaders of six large parties, negotiations will be held early this week on forming a new entity cabinet, following the resignation of Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic's government earlier this month. 
The declaration also pledged RS's readiness to implement all international obligations, including co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
The Office of the High Representative issued a statement Friday highlighting the main developments in BiH over the past year. 
The document stressed that the latest events should not be allowed to "overshadow a year in which -- despite setbacks -- much has been achieved." (Nezavisne novine - 27/12/04; NTV Hayat - 26/12/04; PBS BiH, Fena - 25/12/04)

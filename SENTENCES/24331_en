PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The majority of opposition parties in Kosovo favour the establishment of a unity government to make joint decisions on issues of national interest, local media reported on Wednesday (March 11th).
They also argue this would help overcome challenges in the institution-building process.
The government responded by saying there had never been a lack of national cohesion and there was no crisis that would require a unity government.
In other news, Lamberto Lucas, deputy chief of the EULEX police, said on Wednesday that the EU-led mission was not responsible for security in Kosovo.
Lucas told members of parliament's Committee for Internal Affairs and Security that EULEX was simply a technical mission, obliged to monitor Kosovo police in the field and help them achieve higher professional standards.

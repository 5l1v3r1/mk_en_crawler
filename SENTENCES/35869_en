SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament approved Thursday (22 January) the amended law on citizenship, vetoed by President Boris Trajkovski last month. 
The bill was passed with the support of the ruling coalition, while the main opposition party boycotted the vote. 
All its suggestions for amendments to the bill were rejected. 
Among other things, the law reduces the time required for permanent residence in Macedonia from 15 to eight years.

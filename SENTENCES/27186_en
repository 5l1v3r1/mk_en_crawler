SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US and EU experts arrived in Sarajevo on Monday (November 2nd) for more talks with leaders of the main political parties regarding constitutional changes.
Tuesday's discussions at Camp Butmir, near Sarajevo, are aimed at finding consensus among Serb, Croat and Muslim parties about reforms required to move the country towards NATO and EU membership.
The international community wants to see progress before the next meeting of the Peace Implementation Council on November 18th.
In October, leaders of the seven main parties rejected a US-EU proposed package of reforms aimed at ending the lengthy political stalemate.

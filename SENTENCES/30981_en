SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A meeting of political leaders convened by President Gjorge Ivanov ended on Monday (February 7th) without a breakthrough concerning the opposition's parliamentary boycott.
Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanoski again urged the opposition to return and discuss differences.
After the talks, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, said that the precondition set by the opposition -- to unfreeze A1 TV's bank accounts and release all those detained over the case -- are unacceptable, as they would interfere with the work of the judiciary.
Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM, described the meeting as unsuccessful.

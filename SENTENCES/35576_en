SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative to BiH, Paddy Ashdown, called on BiH policymakers Saturday (7 February) to work to establish efficient law enforcement structures in the country.
Following talks with BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, Ashdown noted BiH is the only country in Europe without a state-level police force capable of combating international and domestic crime.
He also warned that failure to pass crucial anti-crime laws like the one providing for the establishment of the State Information and Protection Agency might seriously jeopardise chances to move closer to the EU.

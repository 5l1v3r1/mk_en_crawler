BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (February 14th) criticised remarks by Croatian President Stipe Mesic, who accused Italian counterpart Giorgio Napolitano of racism in a row over WWII crimes commited by Tito's guerillas against Italians in Croatia.
EC spokesperson Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen described the language used by Mesic as "unacceptable".
She called for calm and restraint on all sides, but refused to comment on whether the issue could affect Croatia's EU membership talks.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker confirmed on Thursday (April 10th) that holding Serbia's local elections in Kosovo a month from now will be considered illegal and that he intends to notify Belgrade of that on Friday, reiterating that only UNMIK is authorised to call elections in Kosovo.
He also acknowledged, however, that UNMIK will not attempt to prevent voting by Serbs in Kosovo.
Serbia is holding both parliamentary and local elections on May 11th.

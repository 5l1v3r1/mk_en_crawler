ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors plan to interrogate retired Croatian Gen Mirko Norac, according to President Stipe Mesic.
On Saturday (19 July), Mesic confirmed press reports that the tribunal had requested an interview with Norac and that the general agreed to talk to prosecutors.
Norac, 35, is reportedly suspected of possible war crimes against ethnic Serbs during the Medak Pocket and Storm wartime operations from 1993-1995.
"He does not feel guilty," said his attorney, Tomislav Sabljar, who has requested at least one month to gather all relevant documents.
In March, a Croatian court sentenced Norac to 12 years in prison for the 1991 deaths of 50 Serb civilians in Gospic.
In other news, Croatia and Serbia plan to form working groups this fall to investigate war crimes.
In an interview for Novi Sad's <I>Dnevnik</I> on Sunday, Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said one group would be responsible for compiling the names of war crimes indictees, while the other would return personal documents to the public.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic confirmed Wednesday (15 March) that Mirjana Markovic, widow of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, must surrender her passport to the Serb judiciary if she visits the country.
Jocic added there is no confirmation that Markovic plans to travel to Serbia from Moscow to attend Milosevic's funeral, scheduled for Saturday in his hometown, Pozarevac.
Though the Belgrade District Court has cancelled an arrest warrant for Markovic, she still faces charges of abuse of office and must appear at the next court hearing, scheduled for 23 March.
If she fails to do so, the arrest warrant will be reissued.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government adopted a draft law on passports Monday (17 March), permitting bilingual identity documents. 
In principle, passports would be printed in the Macedonian language and Cyrillic alphabet and translated into English and French. 
As previously agreed by the coalition partners, however, applicants speaking a language other than Macedonian may request to have their passports printed in their own language and alphabet. 
The law on passports, coupled with the use of Albanian in parliament, were two of the more controversial elements of the Ohrid peace accord.

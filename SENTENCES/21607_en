NEW YORK, United States -- UN Security Council members failed to agree at a session Friday (July 25th) on Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's the new plan for Kosovo.
It envisions reconfiguring UNMIK in order to provide more authority to the EU's new mission, EULEX.
In addition, it obliges UNMIK's chief Lamberto Zannier to conduct a dialogue with Belgrade on several main topics -- police, the justice system, customs, transport, infrastructure, borders and Serbian cultural and religious heritage.
Separately Friday, Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni said he is ready for direct talks with Serbia.
"Pristina is ready to engage in practical talks with Belgrade on a wide range of issues.
We are ready to negotiate directly with Belgrade," Hisseni told journalists.
Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic, however, insisted Belgrade will never talk with a "breakaway" government.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The EU is expected to make the first in a series of inspections next month aimed at establishing Bulgaria's readiness to protect EU classified information.
State Commission for Security of Information chairwoman Tsveta Markova said on Wednesday (19 January) that her panel had opened a procedure that would provide the country access to such classified information after EU entry.
She also said Bulgaria must resolve the matter of files kept by the former communist State Security service.

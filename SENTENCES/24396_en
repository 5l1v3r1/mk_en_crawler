ATHENS, Greece -- Greeks living abroad demonstrated in several European cities Thursday (December 11th) in solidarity with the massive protests in Greece triggered by the death of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer last week. 
Demonstrations were organised in Madrid, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Bordeaux, Istanbul, Rome and Moscow, many of them ending with arrests. 
Observers describe it as a dangerous escalation in the situation.
Meanwhile in Athens, protestors attacked several police stations Thursday and vandalised shops in the Nea Smyrni and Galatsi districts. 
Police said about 15 universities and about 100 high schools in Athens and Thessaloniki remain occupied by students. 
More than 1,000 people took part in a rally in the northern town of Thessaloniki. 
Several hundred demonstrators clashed with security forces outside the Korydalos prison, west of Athens, as they awaited the arrival of two police officers charged in connection with the teenager's death.

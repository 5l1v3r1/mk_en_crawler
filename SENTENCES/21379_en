ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Monday (May 26th), the three social partners -- trade unions, employers' associations and the government -- supported a bill that would raise the minimum wage from 35% to 39% of the average, effective in July. 
The unions initially demanded 50% of the average but backed down amid pressure from both employers and the government.

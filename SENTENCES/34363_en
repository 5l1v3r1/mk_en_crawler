TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament voted on Thursday (23 October) to reject Prime Minister Fatos Nano's nominations of Namik Dokle for foreign minister and Fatmir Xhafa for interior minister. 
A Socialist Party faction led by former Foreign Minister Ilir Meta sided with the opposition on the vote. 
Nano responded by saying that he would make no changes to his cabinet before his party's congress in December. 
Meta accused the prime minister and party chairman of turning the government into a private club that ignores input from those inside the Socialist Party and its allies. 
He vowed to block all other Nano initiatives until he agrees to reshuffle the government. 
The prime minister accused Meta's faction of trying to destabilise the country.

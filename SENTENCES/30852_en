BUCHAREST, Romania -- Lawmakers from the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) have filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court regarding amendments to the pension law, media reported on Thursday (December 9th).
The Court says it will rule on December 15th, which means that enforcing the law will delayed by at least another week.
The new pension law raises the retirement age for men to 65 years and for women to 63 years, but does not differentiate between the contribution periods.
Thus, women would end up with smaller pensions.
Approved by the Deputies Chamber earlier this week, the measure was only awaiting promulgation by the president for enforcement.
Approval of the pension law is among five preconditions set by the IMF for disbursement of the next tranche from the stand-by loan agreement with the country.
In other news, the remains of former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, have been reburied, their son revealed on Thursday.
Their remains were exhumed in July for testing amid family concerns that the couple was not actually buried in the grave at Bucharest's Ghencea cemetery.
DNA tests confirmed last month that the remains are indeed theirs.
Causecu's son, Valentin, said he reburied his parents this week in adjacent graves at the cemetery.

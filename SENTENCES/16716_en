WARSAW, Poland -- During a meeting Thursday (6 April) with Macedonian counterpart Ilinka Mitreva, Polish Foreign Minister Stefan Meller said his country fully backs Macedonia's process of EU and NATO accession.
Meller added that Poland is a firm supporter of the enlargement process, which he said should continue until all Balkan states are members.
After their meeting, the two foreign ministers signed bilateral agreements concerning social insurance and readmission.
Signing readmission agreements with EU member states is a prerequisite for liberalising the visa regime.

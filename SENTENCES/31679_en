ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign affairs committee in parliament issued a statement Thursday (10 April) describing a US Senate request to link economic aid to political criteria as unacceptable. 
The committee convened after Kurdish forces entered the Iraqi city of Kirkuk. 
Earlier this week, the US Senate approved $1 billion in aid to Turkey, as long as Turkey does not send troops to Kurdish-controlled areas of Iraq. 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul demanded on Thursday that Kurdish forces pull out of Kirkuk, concerned that Kurdish control over the city might persist indefinitely. 
Gul contacted US Secretary of State Colin Powell, who reportedly assured him Kurdish forces would begin leaving Kirkuk on Friday morning.

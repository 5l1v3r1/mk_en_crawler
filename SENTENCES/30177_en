PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU foreign ministers extended on Monday (February 21st) the mandate of the EU Special Envoy to Kosovo, Pieter Feith, for additional two months, local media reported Tuesday. 
Feith's contract -- due to expire in the end of February -- will be valid through April. 
The EU Foreign Affairs Council justified the decision with the fact that the EU needs time to consider the manner of its future presence in Pristina.

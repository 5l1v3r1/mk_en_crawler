ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministry issued a press release Sunday (9 March) outlining a series of statements from the European Parliament in support of Croatia's application to join the EU.
The ministry welcomed comments by European Parliament President Pat Cox, who said in an interview that Croatia would be ready to enter the EU together with Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.
In other news, local media in Slovenia reported that Ljubljana will send Zagreb a diplomatic note on implementation of the agreement on the Krsko nuclear plant, with possible amendments, in an effort to delay some of its obligations.
Slovenia and Croatia jointly built the plant as states of the former Yugoslavia.
The countries agreed last year on joint ownership and management.

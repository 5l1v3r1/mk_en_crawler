ANKARA, Turkey -- Police used tear gas on Wednesday (December 16th) to disperse hundreds of former workers of the state-controlled cigarette and alcohol producer TEKEL, who protested in Ankara against job cuts in the company. 
Security officers also used rods and shields to drive back the crowd on the second day of protests near the headquarters of the ruling Justice and Development Party. 
Several workers and journalists were hospitalised with symptoms related to the tear gas.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A local court sentenced Bosnian Serb Gordan Djuric to eight years in prison Thursday (September 10th) for crimes against humanity.
More than 200 Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian city of Prijedor were allegedly taken to Koricanske Stijene and killed by Bosnian Serb forces in 1992.
Their bodies were thrown down a deep ravine on Vlasic Mountain.
Djuric struck a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty.
According to the agreement, in exchange he would receive a sentence of seven to ten years in prison.

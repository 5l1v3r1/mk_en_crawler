PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Constitutional Court has ruled in favour of Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi, saying the acting president did not breach the constitution by also serving as general secretary of the Democratic Party of Kosovo and participating in the recent campaign.
"There is no prohibition in exercising the duty of the acting president of Kosovo and performing functions in a political party," the court said in a statement Tuesday (December 14th).
Krasniqi has been acting as president since Fatmir Sejdiu's resignation in late September.

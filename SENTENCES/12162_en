ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said Monday (11 April) that Greece remains committed to cutting its budget deficit to 3 per cent or less in 2006.
He expressed confidence that the government's programme of cutting costs and boosting revenues would bring the deficit to under the EU threshold.
Greece caused a major uproar in the EU when it was discovered that Athens had reported flawed data in recent years.

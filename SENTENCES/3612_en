Albania, Croatia and Macedonia's entry into NATO in 2008 or 2009 should be a priority, according to US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns.
At a gathering of NATO representatives and policymakers in Washington late last month, he stressed the importance of Euro-Atlantic accession for building stability in the region.
It is time to "finally break down the institutional and national barriers that have retarded the progress of the people of the Balkans, compared, say, to the peoples of Central Europe", Burns said.
A future in NATO and the EU would "solidify for the people of the Balkans the same advantages that the West and Central Europeans have had since the end of communism 15, 16 years ago," he added.
His remarks were welcomed in the three countries, members of the so-called Adriatic Charter.
Together with Albania and Croatia, Macedonia is hoping to prove its readiness for membership in time for the next NATO summit, scheduled for early 2008.
Nikola Dimitrov, Macedonia's national co-ordinator for NATO, described the statement from Burns as "very positive".
At the same time, he stressed, it was not a promise of membership, but rather amounted to strong encouragement for Macedonia to finish its preparations and meet all requirements.
While NATO has made a positive assessment of defence reform in Macedonia, criticisms are still being made concerning political dialogue in the country and about the progress of judicial reform.
During his speech, Burns listed Kosovo's status and updating the Dayton Peace Accord as top policy goals for the Balkans.
In addition, securing the NATO entry of the three Adriatic Charter members is an important priority for both the United States and the EU, he said.
Other countries in the region that aspire to join the Alliance are Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

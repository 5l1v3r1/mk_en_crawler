ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted on Thursday (October 15th) to Israeli criticism over the postponement of a joint military exercise in Turkey, saying his country needs no instruction. 
The routine military drills, dubbed Anatolian Eagle, were supposed to start this past Monday. 
Held every few years, they are aimed at boosting international co-operation. 
According to media reports, Ankara's decision was prompted by Israel's intention to send aircraft that may have been used in operations against Gaza last December. 
"Turkey is a powerful country that makes its decisions on its own. 
Turkey needs no instructions to make its decisions," Erdogan stressed at a press conference before heading to neighbouring Iraq.
In related news, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman announced on Wednesday that it will ask Turkey to explain a new TV series that portrays Israeli soldiers as murderers. 
The new series, aired for the first time this week on Turkish national television, tells the story of a Palestinian family on the West Bank. 
Liberman described the broadcast as "the most serious level of incitement" especially because it was sponsored by the government. 
He added it "bears no connection whatsoever to reality" and should not be broadcast in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN special envoy for the Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari will present his settlement proposal to negotiators for Belgrade and Pristina just after Serbia's January 21st parliamentary elections, according to his spokesman, Remi Dourlot. 
Speaking to the Belgrade daily Vecernje novosti, Dourlot said Ahtisaari's office would await comments from the respective sides before submitting his proposal to the UN Security Council, probably in March. 
Regional media, meanwhile, quoted a source close to Ahtisaari as saying presentation of the proposal would effectively end the Belgrade-Pristina negotiations on Kosovo.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu threatened to resign Thursday (January 7th) unless parliament rejects the 9.5% reduction in the amount workers are expected to contribute to social security, unexpectedly approved by a parliamentary committee. 
Furthermore, lawmakers supported a 12.7% increase in minimum pensions, though that contradicts the terms of the stand-by arrangement with the IMF. 
Vladescu emphasised that this is not the budget he had prepared, and he is perfectly willing to let someone else apply what parliament members have decided. 
Prime Minister Emil Boc agrees with him, saying budget resources are too scarce to allow an increase in pensions, combined with lower contributions.

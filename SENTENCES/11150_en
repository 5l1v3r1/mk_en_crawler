RUSE, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria and Romania marked their signing of the EU Accession Treaty Monday (25 April) with a symbolic ceremony at the Friendship Bridge over the Danube River.
Children from the Bulgarian town of Ruse and Romania's Giurgiu broke down a symbolic border of flowers and threw it into the river, only hours before the presidents and the prime ministers of Bulgaria and Romania signed the treaties in Luxembourg.
The two countries are scheduled to enter the Union in January 2007.
Before the signing, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and EU security chief Javier Solana sealed an agreement giving Bulgaria full access to the exchange of classified information with the EU.

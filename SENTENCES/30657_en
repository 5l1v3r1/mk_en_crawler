SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Thousands of motorists joined rallies in major cities and towns across the country Sunday (March 13th) against a sharp increase in fuel and food prices. 
Many of the protestors blocked gas filling stations, buying fuel for less than 1 euro and paying in coins, which caused big queues. 
The protestors insist the government should lower the excise charged on fuel to cut the price paid by end users. 
Oil industry representatives blame instability in major North African oil producers.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU has agreed to extend the mandate of Pieter Feith, the EU special representative for Kosovo, by six months, local media reported Friday (February 12th).
The decision will be formalised during discussions at the next EU ministers meeting on February 22nd.
Feith is also head of the International Civilian Office (ICO), which implements the Ahtisaari plan of supervised independence for Kosovo.
The ISG has advised the ICO to cut its staff by 15% and may take another look at Feith's mandate in June, should the European Commission report on Pristina's progress be more positive.

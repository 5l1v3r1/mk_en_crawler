BELGRADE, Serbia -- Energy and Mining Minister Aleksandar Popovic, who is also vice president of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), has a good chance of being his party's candidate in the upcoming presidential elections, according to Wednesday's (August 8th) edition of Vecernje Novosti.
His candidacy reportedly will be announced in mid October if the DS-DSS-NS-G17 Plus ruling coalition fails to agree on a joint candidate.
Elections are expected late this year or early in 2008.

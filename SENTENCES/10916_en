BUCHAREST, Romania -- In a major setback for the opposition, former Prime Minister Theodor Stolojan announced Saturday (2 October) that he is pulling out of the presidential election for health reasons. 
Stolojan, who leads the National Liberal Party, was seen as a uniting figure in his party's alliance with the Democrats. 
Democrat leader Traian Basescu is now expected to become the opposition's candidate for the 28 November vote. 
A poll in August showed Prime Minister Adrian Nastase with an eight-point lead over the opposition.

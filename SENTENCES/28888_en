BELGRADE, Serbia/ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities in Serbia and Croatia stepped up tests in the Danube River on Friday (October 8th) amid fears that a toxic spill in the Hungarian section of the river may reach their waters. 
There are no signs of any pollution, officials say, but emergency plans are being drawn up in case. 
Bulgaria and Romania are also on alert.
The October 4th spill happened at the aluminium plant of Ajka, 160km west of Budapest. 
More than 1 million cubic metres of red sludge leaked out of a reservoir at the plant and spread into surrounding villages, killing four people, injuring 100 and wiping out marine life.

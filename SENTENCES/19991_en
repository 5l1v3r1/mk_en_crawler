SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The working group to draft key BiH police reform laws has been created, now that all six parties in the ruling coalition have selected representatives to it, BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Nikola Spiric said on Tuesday (December 18th). 
The group is to develop laws that will create a police co-ordination office, institute for forensic investigation, institute for training of police personnel, police support agency, independent board, citizens' complaint board and police officers' complaint board. 
The task force faces a February 15th deadline.

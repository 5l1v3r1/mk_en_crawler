SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A three-day military drill of NATO members and partners begins Sunday (24 August) in BiH.
At a news conference Thursday, SFOR spokesman Dale MacEachern stressed that the drill is part of regular training and is not related to operations aimed at arresting suspected war criminals.
Apologising for possible travel delays, MacEachern asked residents for their patience in driving around areas used in the military manoeuvres.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj, who is on trial for war crimes before The Hague tribunal, supports his party's efforts to form a government with the Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia (DSS-NS) and the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS). 
Dragan Todorovic, a SRS senior official who visited Seselj last week, said on Sunday (May 18th) that Seselj is satisfied with negotiations held so far among those parties. 
SPS leader Ivica Dacic has said the talks with SRS and DSS-NS will continue on Monday. 
NS leader Velimir Ilic says he is optimistic that a deal on a new ruling coalition would be reached between the SRS, DSS-NS and the SPS.
Also Monday, Blic newspaper continued to report that the SPS has been holding informal negotiations with President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party, which backs a far more pro-Western path for Serbia. 
Coalition building efforts began after inconclusive parliamentary elections on May 11th. 
Voting had to be repeated in several areas on Sunday, due to irregularities. 
The results, expected on Thursday, are not expected to change the outcome of the first election.

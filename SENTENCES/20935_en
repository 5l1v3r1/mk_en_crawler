SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative and EU Special Representative Miroslav Lajcak says he will go before parliament on Thursday (September 6th) to stress the importance of police reform.
Lajcak invited members of the BiH presidency, the BiH Council of Ministers, entity prime ministers and the speakers of entity parliaments to attend.
He said he plans to point out that BiH is facing a stark choice this autumn:
"to continue down the road to the EU and play a role in the region or to isolate itself further from both".
Police reform is key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union.
Separately, Lajcak called on parliament to ratify the Central European Free Trade Agreement, which is on the lawmakers' agenda Wednesday.
Twice already, the ratification process has failed.

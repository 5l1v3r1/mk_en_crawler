ATHENS, Greece -- The country is enduring paralysis Thursday (May 14th) caused by a general strike of public servants against the government's strict economic policy.
The protestors are demanding higher salaries and pensions in the public sector.
As air traffic controllers join the strike, air carriers are cancelling around 150 flights.
Schools are closed, while hospitals are treating only emergency cases.

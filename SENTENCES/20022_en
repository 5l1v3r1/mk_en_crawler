ANKARA, Turkey -- Former Defence Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu was nominated for president on Friday (August 17th).
A member of the far-right Nationalist Movement Party, he is given little chance of defeating the ruling party candidate and current Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
The first round of voting will be held on Monday.
A quorum of 367 members of the 550-seat parliament must be present for the vote.
If necessary, a second round will be held on Friday.

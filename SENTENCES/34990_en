LONDON, England -- The international community's High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Paddy Ashdown, called on foreign investors to consider BiH, saying difficult reforms have finally resulted in real investment opportunities.
Addressing a London-led investment conference on BiH Tuesday (9 December), Ashdown cited the successful experience of foreign banks that have come to the BiH market in the last few years.
"As with all emerging markets, those who are first to spot the opportunities, and who have the confidence to act on this, will reap the greatest rewards," he said.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Party (PD) decided on Thursday (October 4th) to expel parliament members Liviu Nistoran and Radu Tirle from the party because they supported the government of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu in Wednesday's no confidence vote.
The opposition Social Democratic Party, which initiated the vote, plans to expel four members -- Alin Teodorescu, Dan Mihalache, Ion Solcanu and Razvan Theodorescu -- who crossed party lines to vote in favour of the cabinet.

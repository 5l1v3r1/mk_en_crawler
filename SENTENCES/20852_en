BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Sunday (August 5th) that he is "certain" Serbia will join the EU in 2014.
Accession could take place on June 28th of that year, marking the religious holiday Vidovdan, he suggested.
According to Djelic, the date would represent the "symbolic end of the 20th century", one that begun with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo on June 28th, 1914.
He also noted that 2014 represents a new budgetary and electoral cycle in the EU.
Djelic reiterated his view that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement could be signed by the end of this year, but acknowledged this depends on full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague.

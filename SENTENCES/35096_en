SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's runoff presidential election was "generally consistent with international standards" and democratic, but also "marred by serious irregularities," the head of the OSCE observer mission in Skopje said Thursday (29 April). 
Friedrich Bauer told reporters that the problems were more extensive than during the first round and ranged from group and proxy voting to ballot stuffing. 
Opposition candidate Sasko Kedev has accused the ruling Socialists of inflating turnout figures to make the election valid.
In other news, EU leaders Romano Prodi and Javier Solana congratulated Branko Crvenkovski on his victory and said Macedonia is on the road to building a stable, multiethnic society. 
They also promised eventual EU membership.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas said Thursday (28 August) that he hopes for a two-state solution to the Cyprus issue.
Journalists asked Denktas to comment on recent reports that pressure would increase in September to hold negotiations and reach an agreement on reunification.
Denktas acknowledged that there has been pressure since the introduction of the UN-proposed peace plan but said that he would not act on the basis of reports.
Denktas also reiterated his position that two different peoples should live in two different states on the island.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliamentary elections should be held early if Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party (DSS) continues to challenge Serbia's EU integration process, Economy Minister and G17 Plus leader Mladjan Dinkic told B92 on Sunday (March 2nd). 
He suggested the DSS is ignoring an agreement among the ruling coalition partners, which includes EU integration among five priorities for the government.
President Boris Tadic, meanwhile, told the board of his Democratic Party Sunday that the government will function as long as it remains committed to the principles on which it was formed. 
He said only an economically strong Serbia that has many allies can defend its interests concerning Kosovo. 
For this reason, he opposes breaking off diplomatic ties with countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence.

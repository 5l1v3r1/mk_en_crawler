SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragan Covic, the former Croat member of the BiH presidency, was sentenced Friday (November 17th) to five years in jail. 
The BiH Court convicted him on abuse of office charges stemming from an earlier term as a cabinet minister. 
He was also found guilty of having caused nearly 1m euros in damages to the Federation of BiH entity budget in connection with a tax exemption scandal. 
However, the court cleared him of organised crime charges. 
Covic, leader of the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH, has been placed in custody but has the right to appeal the sentence.

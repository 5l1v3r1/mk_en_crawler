SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Uncertainty on the future of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) is growing, following the resignation of Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic earlier this week, local media reported on Thursday (May 28th).
No candidates are in line to replace him.
In his letter to FBiH President Borjana Kristo, Brankovic suggested either of the two deputy prime ministers could be trusted to lead the government during the transition period.
One of them, Culture Minister Gavrilo Grahovac, took a vacation immediately after the announcement, while the other, Finance Minister Vjekoslav Bevanda, refused to take over the job.
Democratic Action Party leader Sulejman Tihic is mum for now.
It was he who called for the resignation after Brankovic was charged with misappropriation, stemming from a real estate deal back when he was CEO of one of BiH's largest engineering firms, Energoinvest.

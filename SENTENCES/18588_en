BELGRADE, Serbia -- A new report by UNICEF has cautioned against the continued risk of child poverty in Serbia, saying that over 155,000 children in the Balkan country are poor and another 155,000 are at risk of falling below the poverty line.
The document was officially presented at a news conference in Belgrade on Friday (February 9th).
It warned that despite important steps taken in this field since the late 1990s, there are still thousands of children, who -- because of material, social and cultural deprivation -- are restricted in their rights and access to education, healthcare, and protection.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Visiting Sarajevo on Thursday (22 July), European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten said that BiH has achieved considerable progress in adopting reforms outlined in the European Commission's Feasibility Study. 
He cautioned, however, that laws must not only be adopted, but also implemented. 
Patten stressed that the actions of BiH authorities would determine the speed with which the country moves towards starting talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
He praised the establishment of the State Investigation and Protection Agency, describing it as a major step forward in the fight against organised crime. 
On Friday, he will attend the first meeting of the BiH Police Restructuring Commission in Sarajevo.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic admitted on Monday (December 1st) the need for a government reshuffle to boost efficiency and cut costs.
To that end, he will propose cutting the number of ministries from 16 to 12 and will suggest establishing a single entity health insurer to unite the 11 existing cantonal ones.
The ruling coalition parties, the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and the Croatian Democratic Union BiH, called for a government reshuffle immediately after the October 5th local elections, which showed the other two coalition parties -- Brankovic's Party for BiH and the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH 1990 -- clearly losing support.
The ruling coalition allies met once last month to discuss the issue but failed to reach a compromise.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Wednesday (25 January) that the fast adoption of new election laws and judicial reform laws is a government priority. 
He also suggested that the issues are more important than setting the exact date of the next parliamentary elections. 
The opposition has been urging elections be held earlier than the 3 July-3 October period required by law.
The same day, parliament passed a long-anticipated law on free access to public information. 
Several NGOs have criticised the law, however, saying it contains significant weaknesses.
Also Wednesday, Macedonia and the United States sealed an agreement on bilateral co-operation in the fields of science and technology. 
The agreement is aimed at intensifying collaboration in joint projects over the next ten years.

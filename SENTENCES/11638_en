PARIS, France -- French President Jacques Chirac and visiting Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano agreed on Thursday (20 January) that their bilateral ties are excellent, though economic ties could be strengthened. 
Chirac pledged that "Albania will have France's support in its way towards the EU". 
Nano said he hopes Albania would be able to seal the Stabilisation and Association Agreement this year and enter the Union in 2014.
In other news, the Albanian Daily News reported Friday that the labour ministry wants to re-establish an agreement with Germany on employing Albanian nationals. 
The agreement, signed in December 1991, provided for sending Albanian workers to Germany to gain professional and language experience. 
It was suspened in 1995 following violations.

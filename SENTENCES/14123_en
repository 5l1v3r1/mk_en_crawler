WASHINGTON, United States -- The US Helsinki Commission human rights group urged the Turkish government on Friday (14 October) to drop charges against a writer who condemned the mass killings of Armenians early in the 20th century. 
"A stable democracy cannot blossom until the government ends the practice of stifling free speech and removes the clouds of deception and censorship from a true telling of history," the Commission said in a letter to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In other news, Kurdish rebels killed one Turkish soldier and wounded another in clashes in the southeast of the country.

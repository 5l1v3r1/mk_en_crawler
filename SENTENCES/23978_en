SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric decided on Friday (July 17th) to dismiss Security Minister Tarik Sadovic, the government announced. 
Earlier this week, Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) asked for Sadovic's replacement after he refused to step down. 
The party sought the minister's removal due to complaints from "important foreign and local institutions" about his poor communication and co-operation, SDA leader Sulejman Tihic said. 
Local media reported US officials had accused Sadovic of not taking prompt action to expel Islamic extremists believed to have links with the al-Qaeda terror network.

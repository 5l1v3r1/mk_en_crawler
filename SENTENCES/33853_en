SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government adopted amendments Monday (17 November) to the law on identity cards, intended to bring the bill in line with EU standards.
New identity cards are to be printed in both Macedonian and English.
Cards for those speaking an official language other than Macedonian -- specifically, the ethnic Albanian minority -- also will be printed in that language, in accordance with the provisions of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
In other news, MIA reports that Ljupco Jordanovski has been elected the new parliament speaker.
He was nominated by the ruling Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia to replace Nikola Popovski, who became a cabinet minister in the recent government reshuffle.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Thousands joined a rally in Sofia on Friday (September 24th) insisting on the introduction of mandatory religion classes in schools. 
During the peaceful protest by both clerics and members of the public, they demanded mandatory study of Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism or Islam. 
The government said it will put the issue to a public debate. 
Religion is currently an optional course in Bulgarian schools.

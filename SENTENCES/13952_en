ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis and the interior ministers from Turkey, Pakistan and Iran began a two-day meeting in Athens Friday (16 December).
They are discussing efforts to strengthen co-operation against drug trafficking, illegal migration and organised crime.
The meeting comes a day after officials announced that a joint three-year operation had smashed a people trafficking ring that spanned Greece, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Italy and France.
Dozens of people were arrested in the five countries.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling extended by a year Thursday (February 15th) the mandate of the BiH commission investigating past decisions to grant citizenship to foreigners.
The current mandate ends this week.
In a statement from his office, Schwarz-Schilling noted that under "normal circumstances", the extension would have been granted by the BiH parliament.
Since the process of constituting parliament is still going on, Schwarz-Schilling stepped in.

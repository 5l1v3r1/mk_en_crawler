SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO has been receiving more leads from Republika Srpska regarding fugitives sought by the UN war crimes tribunal, according to the Alliance's spokesman in BiH, Derek Chappell.
In a Sunday (20 August) interview with Dnevni avaz, he said tips were coming both from RS authorities and citizens.
He described it as public recognition that war crimes indictees are people of the past.
On Friday, NATO and EUFOR troops raided the Banja Luka home of Tomo Djuric, as well as his relatives' house in Strpce.
Officials say Djuric, 25, is linked to the network supporting war crimes suspect Stojan Zupljanin.
No one was arrested.
Also Friday, EUFOR announced that its personnel found a large stash of illegal weapons near the village of Nikolici, close to Pale.
A tip led them to the weapons Thursday.

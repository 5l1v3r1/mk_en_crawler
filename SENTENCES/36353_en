ANKARA, Turkey -- On Saturday (22 May), Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul stated that any EU failure to start accession talks with his country would destroy the Union's ideals of ethnic and cultural diversity.
Gul said his country has met the set of conditions, known as the Copenhagen criteria, for the start of accession talks.
The EU will decide at a summit in December on whether to launch negotiations with Turkey.
Meanwhile, Turkish and World Bank representatives completed talks Friday on the signing of a $1 billion loan agreement.
Half of the money will be released in June and the remaining part in the autumn, provided Turkey proceeds with reforms.
The loan is part of the Bank's $4.5 billion programme for Turkey for the period 2004 to 2006.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Supreme Defence Council decided on Friday (11 February) to open the Topcider military facility to the public, in the wake of a scandal concerning the secret underground base. 
There have been persistent rumours that two soldiers who died there last October were killed after discovering the presence of indicted war criminals.
Belgrade media, meanwhile, are reporting that Ratko Mladic's former head of security, Branislav Puhalo, might still be employed by the Serbia-Montenegro Army. 
Senior defence officials have denied the allegations, which were made by former government information chief Vladimir Popovic in a recent TV interview. 
But Puhalo's wife and brother have both told Radio B92 that he is working for the federal military.

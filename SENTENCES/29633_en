BELGRADE, Serbia -- Security is tight in Belgrade, in advance of Sunday's (May 29th) planned rally by the opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) in support of former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, who was arrested on May 26th. 
The party believes that the arrest and Serbia's co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal amounts to treason of national interests. 
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says police are prepared to respond to any violation of public order during the gathering. 
Mladic has called on the public to refrain from violence, according to his son, Darko.

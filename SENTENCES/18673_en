BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik criticised Bosniak leader Haris Silajdzic on Wednesday (June 6th) for saying that RS was responsible for the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica. 
Visiting London earlier this week, Silajdzic, the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, reportedly called for the abolition of the RS entity because it was "created from genocide", and cited the recent ruling of The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) as proof. 
Dodik angrily accused Silajdzic of slandering RS and spreading lies about it, saying the ICJ ruling incriminated individuals and groups of individuals, but not RS.

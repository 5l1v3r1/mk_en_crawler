BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic said Tuesday (19 April) that there is no reason to replace RS Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic in connection with the controversial behaviour of army recruits during their weekend oath-taking. 
Stankovic is to submit a report on the matter to NATO and the Office of the High Representative Wednesday. 
The recruits booed during the Bosnian national anthem and pledged allegiance only to Republika Srpska, rather than both Bosnian entities.
In other news, representatives of the BiH and Montenegrin security agencies sealed an agreement Tuesday on co-operation in combating money laundering. 
The document envisions collaboration in collecting and analysing statistical reports, as well as the exchange of financial investigation data.
Also Tuesday, a BiH parliamentary delegation kicked off a two-day visit to Albania. 
The focus is on boosting bilateral co-operation, particularly economic ties.

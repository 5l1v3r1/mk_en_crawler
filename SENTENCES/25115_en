SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts announced on Wednesday (August 26th) they have wrapped up work at a mass grave in Koricanske Stijene, where the bodies of at least 50 Muslim and Croat victims of the 1992-1995 conflict were found. 
More than 200 Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian city of Prijedor were allegedly taken to Koricanske Stijene and killed by Bosnian Serb forces in 1992. 
Their bodies were thrown down a deep ravine on Vlasic Mountain.
Gordan Djuric, charged with committing crimes against humanity in connection with the massacre, struck a deal with prosecutors Wednesday. 
According to the agreement, he will plead guilty and will accept a sentence of seven to ten years in prison.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The US House of Representatives voted Monday (7 October) to give President George W. 
Bush the authority to restore normal trade with Yugoslavia after receiving assurances from the administration that Belgrade was co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The measure must also be approved by the Senate to become law. 
In May, Secretary of State Colin Powell certified Yugoslavia as eligible for $40m in US financial assistance. 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic called for the restoration of normal trade relations between the two countries last month.
In other news, representatives of the former Yugoslav republics met in Sarajevo Monday for a new round of talks on the distribution of assets among the successor states. 
Afterwards, BiH central bank Vice Governor Kemal Kozaric said the participants agreed the division should be made in accordance with principles stipulated in the succession accords. 
Yugoslavia would obtain 38 per cent of the assets, BiH 15.5 per cent, Croatia 23 per cent, Slovenia 16 per cent, and Macedonia 7.5 per cent.

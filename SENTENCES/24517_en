PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 50 protesters and eight local police officers suffered injuries on Sunday (March 8th) in clashes that erupted during a demonstration against electricity outages. 
Around 200 Kosovo Serbs gathered to protest power cuts in the central village of Shillova, where they tried to block the main road leading to Pristina. 
They threw bottles and stones at police officers who moved in to stop them. 
Kosovo police spokesman Ismet Hashani said police took measures adequate to the situation. 
Kosovo's national electricity company says the power outages are a penalty for unpaid bills, some dating back to 1999.

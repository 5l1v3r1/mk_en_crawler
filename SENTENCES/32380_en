BUCHAREST, Romania -- Army Chief Gen Mihail Popescu presented a timetable for reform Wednesday (26 March), describing NATO accession as a top priority.
To that end, the army will be restructured, through downsizing and transforming units into more flexible forces for deployment in critical areas.
The military also plans to implement an integrated anti-aircraft defence system, develop a database of railways terminals, airports and ports to facilitate movement of NATO forces, and adjust military education and training to meet NATO standards.

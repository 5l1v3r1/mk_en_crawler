ATHENS, Greece -- A group of experts from the IMF, the European Commission (EC) and the European Central Bank (ECB) arrive in Athens on Monday (June 14th) to assess progress in implementing austerity measures aimed at slashing the huge public deficit. 
Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou expressed optimism Sunday that Greece is on the right track. 
Prime Minister George Papandreou echoed that sentiment, saying the country will need no additional measures as long as the goals are being met. 
In an interview with the Realnews newspaper Sunday, Papandreou said that "the budget shows a deficit that is about 40% lower than last year's, within targets." (SKAI, Vima, Ta Nea - 14/06/10; AFP - 13/06/10)

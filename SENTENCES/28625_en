SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry announced on Monday (September 13th) it has seized a record amount of a chemical that is a key ingredient in producing heroin.
Two Croatian citizens were arrested in an operation at the Kapitan Andreevo border checkpoint with Turkey.
They are suspected of smuggling about 13 tonnes of acetic anhydride -- enough to make five tonnes of heroin.
Officials say cans of the substance were hidden in a truck with Croatian license plates loaded with paper rolls.
The operation was carried out jointly by the Bulgarian, Serbian and Romanian police, in co-ordination with Europol, the EU's crime fighting agency.

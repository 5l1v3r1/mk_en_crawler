WASHINGTON, United States -- In a statement issued on Thursday (May 24th), the State Department expressed disappointment that three days of US-mediated closed-door talks between Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Bosniak presidency member Haris Silajdzic and Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik failed to produce results. 
The US declined to blame either side, saying that neither was willing to make a compromise. 
The talks in Washington were aimed at breakthroughs in police restructuring and other key reforms required for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU. 
The US proposed, in part, changing the name of RS to the Republic of Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats, to better incorporate all communities in the entity.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government's Council for European Integration adopted a plan Wednesday (8 December) designed to accelerate implementation of the remaining measures recommended by the European Commission for 2005.
Panel chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov said the document envisions implementing 586 measures through the enforcement of 47 bills next year.
In other news Wednesday, Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov announced that the United States plans to establish one or two military bases in Bulgaria and deploy up to 3,000 troops there.
He said these would be small facilities, not the large bases established in Western Europe after World War II.
Regarding a separate issue, Svinarov said a decision on continuing the Bulgarian presence in Iraq should be expected after January.
He confirmed that the government is mulling over different options, including withdrawal from Iraq.

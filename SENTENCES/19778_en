SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Office of the High Representative spokesperson Mario Brkic said on Tuesday (February 19th) that any irresponsible attempts to draw parallels between situations in BiH and Kosovo would be rejected, as BiH is a sovereign country whose territorial integrity is guaranteed by the Dayton Peace Accord. 
He also rejected the possibility of organising a secession referendum in Republika Srpska, as entity Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has suggested. 
Brkic appealed to local political leaders to conduct themselves in a way that does not undermine the BiH Constitution or the Dayton Accord.
Also Tuesday, the RS government issued a tersely-worded statement criticising Bosniak parties for obstructing the police reform package. 
The RS cabinet called on the BiH parliament to pass the draft laws as soon as possible, as they are key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian government has submitted an addendum to the Letter of Intent under the $149m stand-by arrangement with the IMF, highlighting financial and economic policies to improve the national economy's performance.
The letter stipulates that the central bank, HNB, would restrict excessive credit expansion activities of commercial banks with price-oriented measures until the end of the year.
The addendum says GDP growth would be expected to reach 4.2 per cent, while the annual inflation rate will be kept below 3 per cent.

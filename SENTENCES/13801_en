PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic announced on Sunday (21 August) that he would initiate talks with all parties in parliament about the long-expected independence referendum initiative.
Vujanovic says the terms of the referendum should be determined by the republic's legislature.
A day earlier, he reiterated that unless Serbia accepts a proposal to restructure the Serbia-Montenegro federal union into a looser confederation of internationally recognised independent states, Podgorica would proceed with organising the referendum early next year.

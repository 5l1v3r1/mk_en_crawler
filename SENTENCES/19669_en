BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu assured Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic on Thursday (February 21st) that Romania fully supports Serbia and is ready to provide any assistance it needs for EU integration bid.
Tadic paid his first visit abroad since Kosovo declared independence by going to Romania, one of the countries that denounced Kosovo's move.
In Bucharest, Tadic said that Serbia would not choose isolationist polices and would not use force to prevent Kosovo's independence.
Talks also focused on joint economic projects and the possibility of Serbia using Romania's seaports.

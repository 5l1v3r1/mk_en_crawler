ATHENS, Greece -- Two gunmen who hijacked a public bus released the last six hostages and surrendered to Greek police after an 18-hour standoff near Athens early Thursday (16 December). 
Police reported that the two men were 24-year-old Albanians who have lived in Greece for six or seven years. 
The two demanded a Euro1m ransom for the 25 hostages, and were apparently planning to take the bus to their home country. 
Greek Public Order Minister Giorgos Voulgarakis said the security services were well-prepared to handle the crisis because of the extensive training they received for the 2004 Olympics.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Bank of Albania published a report on tourism Tuesday (October 5th) showing lower than expected incomes, given the record number of tourists visiting the country.
Tourism development in Albania has been trumpeted by the government as a sector experiencing a boom in recent years.
The number of tourists has increased tenfold since 2004, the Central Bank confirmed, but at the same time, state revenues from the sector have grown only 2.1 times, compared to six years ago.
Local media commented that the report casts a shadow on government statements touting its success in attracting flocks of tourists that boost revenues.

TIRANA, Albania -- A plant in Elbasan, central Albania, will dismantle old ammunition from across the Balkans, local media reported on Saturday (January 8th).
The head of the plant, Daniel Karanxha, said it will become the first facility to do so in the region, dismantling ammunition from Serbia, Greece and Croatia.
The plant plans to open a new line this year, boosting its capacity to four dismantling lines.
About 21,000 tonnes of ammunition has been dismantled at the country's biggest plant over the last decade.
The defence ministry has announced plans to destroy about 25,000 tonnes more this year alone.

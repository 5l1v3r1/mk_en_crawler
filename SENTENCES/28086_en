ANKARA, Turkey -- As parliament proceeded with debates on a package of constitutional amendments Tuesday (April 20th), three more articles were approved. 
The opposition parties, except for the Nationalist Movement Party, continued to boycott the vote. 
The Republican People's Party (CHP), the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party and the smaller opposition Democratic Leftist Party are refusing to attend parliamentary sessions devoted to debating the amendments, which they say strip power from the secular courts. 
The CHP said it is prepared to challenge the amendments before the Constitutional Court, though the timing is unclear. 
Parliamentary debate, which began on Monday, is expected to last about ten days. 
If necessary, the ruling Justice and Development Party has said it will hold a public referendum on the reforms.

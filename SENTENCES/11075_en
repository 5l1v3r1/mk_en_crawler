SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Three parties from Republika Srpska (RS) -- the ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the main opposition Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Democratic National Union (DNZ) -- sent letters of support Wednesday (27 July) for the continuation of political talks on police reforms, as requested by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
His spokeswoman, Ljiljana Radetic, told the newspaper Nezavisne novine that the SDS, SNSD and DNZ voiced their clear support in written form after Ashdown criticised them for failing to send representatives to the latest meeting on police restructuring earlier this week.
BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic meanwhile said Wednesday that he was ready to call new talks by the end of this week.
Police reform is a key requirement for the launch of Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU.

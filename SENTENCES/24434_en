SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the ruling Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) backed the nomination of Mustafa Mujezinovic as prime minister of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) on Thursday (June 11th).
Mujezinovic is former prime minister of the Sarajevo Canton and BiH ambassador to Malaysia.
Outgoing FBiH Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic resigned last month after being charged with misappropriation, stemming from a real estate deal in 2000 when he was CEO of one of BiH's largest engineering firms, Energoinvest.

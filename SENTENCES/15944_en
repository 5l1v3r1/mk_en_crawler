BELGRADE, Serbia -- Speaking at a meeting of US and Serbian businessmen Wednesday (18 October), US Ambassador Michael Polt said Serbia would not be able to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme until it captures war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic and sends him to The Hague.
Membership in NATO would also require Serbia to accept an internationally-endorsed solution on the future of Kosovo, he added.
Separately Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer denied reports that Serbia could join the PfP with Mladic at large.
He urged Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to issue a public appeal for the arrest.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg will meet with leaders of his National Movement Simeon II party on Tuesday (14 January) to discuss possible cabinet reshuffles. 
Last month, he announced he would consider changes in leadership, following a series of conflicts with the judicial system. 
Last week, he appointed two new advisers. 
Other appointments can be expected shortly, according to government spokesman Dimitar Tsonev.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Talks between Turkey and South Korea on building a new nuclear plant in the western Turkish region of Sinop failed, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz announced on Saturday (November 13th).
The weekend G20 summit in Seoul was the deadline for reaching an agreement on the project but energy pricing and state guarantees remained thorny issues in the negotiations.
Yildiz noted that he had invited the Japanese engineering company Toshiba Plant Systems and Services for talks that will reportedly start this week.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has also indicated interest in the project.
Russia and Turkey have already signed a contract to invest in another nuclear plant.

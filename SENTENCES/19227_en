MOSCOW, Russia -- The government has drafted a package of measures to be implemented should Kosovo unilaterally declare independence, Aleksander Botsan-Kharchenko, Russia's envoy in the latest Kosovo status talks, said on Monday (January 28th). 
He was also quoted by Reuters as warning both the US and EU that recognising independence would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe in the province.
Also Monday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Slovakia, an EU member that has voiced firm opposition to Kosovo's independence. 
Ban said that, in principle, the future status of Kosovo is an EU issue and that the Union will have the main responsibility for it. 
He added, however, that the UN would closely monitor developments.

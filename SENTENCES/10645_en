LUXEMBOURG -- European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten said on Monday (11 October) that the EU has relaunched the Feasibility Report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro, following a meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
The Union decided to resume talks with Belgrade after the political leaders of Serbia-Montenegro endorsed the "twin-track" approach suggested by the EU for trade and economic issues.
According to Patten, the report could be ready by the spring of next year.
He also reiterated that Serbia-Montenegro and other Western Balkan countries were expected to honour commitments and fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.

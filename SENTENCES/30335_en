ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu held a phone conversation on Saturday (March 19th) with his US and British counterparts, Hillary Clinton and William Hague, to discuss recent developments in Libya.
NATO member Turkey is following closely the situation and will make the "necessary and appropriate" contribution to the operation, the Foreign Ministry in Ankara said in a statement.
French, British and US forces on Saturday launched attacks against Gaddafi's air defence systems.
The air strikes were launched after an emergency meeting in Paris between EU, US and Arab officials.
The international community was determined to enforce the UN Security Council resolution 1973 to protect civilians in Libya, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said after the meeting.
The first air strikes were carried out by French fighter jets, which destroyed several armoured vehicles near Benghazi.
Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi slammed what he called "international aggression" and vowed to retaliate.

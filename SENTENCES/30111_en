PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A dozen of Serbs blocked the road from Mitrovica to Leposavic on Wednesday (February 23rd) for the second day in a row. 
The protest is against joint patrolling by Serb and Albanian Traffic Unit police officers in the northern municipalities. 
Mitrovica regional police spokesperson Besim Hoti said the peaceful protest lasted one hour. 
He added that Serb community members plan protests in Zubin Potok, part of the territory Pristina is struggling to gain control over.

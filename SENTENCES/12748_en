STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court for Human Rights ruled on Thursday (3 February) that Turkish authorities violated human rights provisions by torturing a prisoner while trying to get information about suspected links to Kurdish separatists. 
The court rejected claims by the Turkish government that Lazgin Biyan's injuries were self-inflicted.

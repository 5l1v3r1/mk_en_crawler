TIRANA, Albania -- A coalition of opposition parties announced on Thursday (December 3rd) a new wave of protests against the government. 
Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said the demonstrators will demand not only transparency regarding the June 28th general elections process, but also the resignation of Prime Minister Sali Berisha and early elections. 
The first protest will be held outside the headquarters of public broadcaster TVSH, where demonstrators will call for the director to resign. 
It will be followed by daily protests, continuing until all opposition demands are met.
In other news Thursday, 74 lawmakers adopted a bill to fight organised crime as opposition party lawmakers boycotted the session. 
Berisha stressed that the measure demonstrates to all Albanians and the country's European partners its intolerance of organised crime and the mafia. 
He also said the legislation will help Albanians travel without visas to Europe. 
Berisha accused Rama, who is also mayor of Tirana, of supporting mafia members in the construction business.

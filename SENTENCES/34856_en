SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Citizens are barred from having weapons in public places under new changes in the law on buying, use and carrying of weapons that came into force Friday (1 August). 
The law defines the term "public place" as any place to which access is free and unconditional, explained parliament's deputy chairwoman, Liljana Popovska. 
Only army and police personnel would be allowed to carry arms in public. 
The amendment is in line with the new law on voluntary disarmament adopted in May. 
The nationwide disarmament programme is to start in November and would impose severe penalties on those who miss the legal deadline for handing over illegal weapons and munitions.

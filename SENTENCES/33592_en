TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament has suspended its work until after the local elections scheduled for 12 October.
But Parliament Speaker Servet Pellumbi told the daily <I> Panorama</I> on Saturday (13 September) that the recess would not affect the preparation of laws, as the review of draft legislation scheduled for that period would continue.
Meanwhile, President Alfred Moisiu urged district police department chiefs Monday to beef up law enforcement during the vote.

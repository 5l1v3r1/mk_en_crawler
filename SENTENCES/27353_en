BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government decided on Friday (May 28th) to allow EU citizens, as well as those of Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, to enter Serbia and travel around the country without a passport this summer, relying instead on an identity card. 
The announcement, made at a joint press conference in Belgrade by Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, signals Serbia's determination to integrate with Europe. 
Last month, Serbia, a main transit point between Western Europe, Greece and Turkey, allowed EU citizens to proceed with only an ID card when the Icelandic ash cloud halted air traffic throughout Europe.

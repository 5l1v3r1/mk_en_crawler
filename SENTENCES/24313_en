TIRANA, Albania -- Politics should remain separate from the judicial system, while justice means treating all citizens equally and fairly, President Bamir Topi said on Sunday (May 10th). 
He was hosting an event marking the 96th anniversary of the establishment of the Albanian justice system. 
Topi thanked judges, prosecutors and the police for their contributions over the years and reiterated the need for independence and integrity within the system.

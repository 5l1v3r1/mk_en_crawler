BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said on Wednesday (May 11th) that Serbia can and should do more to arrest the two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
After meeting with President Boris Tadic in Belgrade, Brammertz noted that the tribunal still believes Mladic is hiding in Serbia.
Tadic vowed that Belgrade will continue to search for the two suspects until it completes co-operation with the court.
Brammertz visited Serbia to assess the government's efforts before he presents his mid-year report on co-operation to the UN Security Council in June.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government adopted and forwarded to parliament amendments Thursday (September 10th) to two controversial laws -- on in-vitro fertilisation and the ban on public smoking.
The first would allow couples to sign a notarised statement confirming their relationship rather than forcing them to go to court to prove it.
Another change will allow children, conceived by donated eggs or sperm, to obtain information about their biological parents once they turn 18, if donors gave prior permission.
The government decided not to lift the ban on freezing embryos.
Amendments to the smoking ban would allow customers to light up in designated smoking sections in cafes, granted the cafes provide a proper ventilation system.
The ban remains in effect in restaurants, hospitals, schools and airports.
Cafe and restaurants owners have complained that business has virtually collapsed since the ban was introduced in May.

ANKARA, Turkey -- On Tuesday (3 December), the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) submitted a package of constitutional amendments to parliament.
If adopted, the measures would lift some restrictions on the eligibility of parliament members, clearing the way for AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to compete in a run-off in the province of Siirt.
A conviction for inciting religious intolerance prevented him from running in last month's parliamentary elections.
A victory would likely result in Erdogan assuming the post of prime minister.
His party has nearly the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution.

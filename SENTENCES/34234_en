ZAGREB, Croatia -- The office of the chief prosecutor has forwarded to the presidency and the government a detailed report on war crimes investigations linked to the "Storm" military operation.
A government press release issued Friday (4 July) says the document reviews criminal charges and trials conducted against participants in the counterattack operation during the 1991-1995 Serbian-Croatian war.
Authorities plan to analyse the report and forward it to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In other news, the labour and social ministry presented a three-year reform project Saturday, aimed at expanding benefits available to those living below the poverty line -- nearly 10 per cent of the population, according to the World Bank.

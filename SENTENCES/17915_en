TRIPOLI, Libya -- A regional court in Libya on Wednesday (July 18th) acquitted the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor of all charges under a slander claim filed by Libyan officer Selim Juma. 
A similar slander suit against the nurses also ended in acquittal earlier this year. 
Wednesday's ruling came just hours after one that commuted their death sentences -- stemming from a controversial HIV infection case -- to life in prison.
Libya said on Wednesday "the ball is in Europe's court ". 
It noted that the case is not yet closed and said guarantees are still expected regarding the treatment of hundreds of HIV-infected children. 
Theoretically, the six can be transferred to Bulgaria under a bilateral accord sealed in 1984.

KFOR Commander General Giuseppe Valotto is leaving the post at the end of this month after one year of service. 
On Thursday (17 August), the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) organised a special reception for him, attended by local and international officials.
"KPC is efficient, disciplined and capable of reaching any objective," Valotto said. 
"I am especially happy that over the last years, we have managed to lay the foundations for excellent co-operation and for the future."
He promised continued KFOR support for KPC, and for any changes in its mission.
The same day, Valotto and Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku paid a visit to the village of Zaqishta, where 44 new houses have been built for Serb returnees. 
They also planned to meet with Serbs in the village of Hoca e Madhe, but the community declined to meet with them.
"We are here to do more for the integration of the Serb community, which is confused because of Belgrade's influence," Ceku said.
During a stop in the municipality of Maliseva, Valotto said that after one year he considered himself a Kosovar, adding that he is concerned about the economic situation. 
"I hope that the final status will be acceptable for everyone," he said.
Valotto took up his post on 1 September 2005, succeeding Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon. 
He was the tenth commander of KFOR since its deployment to Kosovo.

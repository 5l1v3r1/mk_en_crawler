TIRANA, Albania -- The administration has completed the additional answers requested by the European Commission (EC), as part of the process of seeking EU candidate status.
Government sources said on Monday (June 7th) that Integrations Minister Majlinda Bregu is expected to travel to Brussels soon to deliver the responses to 180 additional questions requested in May.
The deadline is Thursday.
Experts will then visit Albania to verify the information.
Though the EC has announced no timeframe, Albania hopes to be granted candidate status by the end of the year.

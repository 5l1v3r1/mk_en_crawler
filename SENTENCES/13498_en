SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The latest UNDP Early Warning Report for Macedonia indicates public trust in state institutions has declined.
Presenting the results in Skopje on Friday (24 March), UNDP resident representative Norimasa Shimomura said that in the first quarter of the year, public trust fell for all institutions -- except for military and religious ones.
The UNDP says the trend could be attributed to generally low economic prospects and rising corruption.
The survey found that over 50 per cent of citizens do not trust the government or parliament and view the customs authorities as most corrupt.
On the positive side, Shimomura noted improvement with regard to interethnic relations.
Only 4 per cent of those polled said interethnic ties are a problem.

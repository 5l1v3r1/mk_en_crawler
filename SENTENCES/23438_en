STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe and the US Embassy in Tirana on Tuesday (December 23rd) criticised Albania's newly adopted lustration law, passed by parliament Monday.
The law requires all officials to undergo investigation to determine whether they co-operated with the secret services during the communist regime.
The Council of Europe said it regrets parliament adopted it quickly and without the necessary public debate, as the measure may cause more injustice rather than resolve past issues.
The US Embassy said in a statement the law raises serious legal, governmental and constitutional concerns.
It passed with only 74 votes, all by the ruling Democratic Party's lawmakers.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha defends the bill, as "an historic victory ...
over political crime".

ATHENS, Greece -- The government officially presented on Monday (15 September) the draft electoral law, which will be discussed with other political parties in the coming months.
The amendments aim to modernise the existing system, simplify election rules, strengthen the element of proportional representation and at the same time create preconditions for forming a strong government.
The bill proposes that up to 80 or 85 per cent of the seats in parliament be divided among the parties using a system of proportional representation, and offers two alternative methods for distribution of remaining seats.
The government is expected to approve the measure by the end of November.

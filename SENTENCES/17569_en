NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In a declaration adopted unanimously Thursday (April 19th), the Cypriot Parliament called on the government to collect payments from Britain for deployments at two military bases on Cyprus.
The lawmakers claim Britain owes millions of pounds for its use of the bases since 1965.
However, the British Embassy in Nicosia says the United Kingdom has met all financial obligations to Cyprus.

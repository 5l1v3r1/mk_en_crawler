THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Clashes broke out between Nigerian immigrants and local police Sunday (August 19th), after a man jumped from a cafeteria terrace and died. 
A group of Nigerian immigrants and youth wearing face marks gathered near the site of the incident, which happened in a suburb of Thessaloniki. 
Rioters damaged cars and threw stones at policemen who responded. 
Three suffered minor injuries.
The dead Nigerian had been selling pirated CDs in the cafeteria and thought two men who entered the bar were plainclothes officers coming to arrest him.

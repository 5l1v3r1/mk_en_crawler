PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier says for now, there is no plan to re-open the customs checkpoints that were badly damaged during clashes in northern Kosovo following its declaration of independence.
Media reported on Saturday (August 2nd) that Zannier has instead asked authorities in Pristina and Belgrade to debate the issue.
Kosovo's government says Zannier's actions regarding the Serb minority fail to comply with the constitution and the plan drafted by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said Kosovo will integrate the Serb minority but will not allow the functioning of parallel structures.

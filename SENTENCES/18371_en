TRIPOLI, Libya -- The EU sees "a window of opportunity" for resolving the case of the six foreign medics on death row in Libya, says EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. 
She and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor at a Tripoli prison on Monday (June 11th). 
The six have been imprisoned for over eight years on charges -- disputed by international experts -- of infecting hundreds of chilren with HIV. 
Seif al-Islam, the son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, met with the EU officials this week and said he expects the case to be resolved soon.

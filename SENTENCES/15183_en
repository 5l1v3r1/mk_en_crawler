TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj wraps up an official visit to China on Friday (December 1st). 
On Wednesday, he and counterpart Li Zhaoxing discussed concrete measures to boost bilateral ties, particularly co-operation in trade, education and culture. 
Mustafaj's visit was postponed repeatedly because of a dispute over Albania's decision to grant asylum to five Chinese Uighur Muslims, released this spring from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay. 
China has been pressing for their extradition, claiming they are terrorists, not political refugees.

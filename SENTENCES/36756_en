TIRANA, Albania -- Hundreds of Albanians bid a final farewell Wednesday (21 July) to Queen Susan, the wife of the crown heir Leka Zog I. 
The queen died on Saturday at the age of 63. 
Susan Barbara Cullen-Ward, born in Australia, married Leka in Biarritz in October 1975. 
Wednesday's ceremony was held in a hall at the Dajti Hotel in Tirana and was attended by the royal family, representatives of all religious communities and members of the public. 
The queen was buried in the Sharra cemetery next to Queen Mother Geraldine, who died in 2002, just months after the royal family returned to Albania following 50 years in exile.

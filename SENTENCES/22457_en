SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak admitted on Tuesday (October 14th) the concept of a multi-ethnic BiH state is difficult to achieve, although it has not yet failed.
In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel, Lajcak said the international community would not allow secession or an independence referendum in Republika Srpska (RS), as this "would cross the international community's red line".
Nor, he said, could RS survive economically as an independent state.
Asked whether he could use his powers to remove RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, Lajcak replied dismissal wouldn't help improve the situation.
Still, he admitted that Dodik is threatening to destroy BiH in an easier and legal way by withdrawing his ministers and lawmakers from central state institutions.

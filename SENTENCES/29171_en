TIRANA, Albania -- Ilir Meta, leader of the junior government partner Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), urged the opposition on Sunday (July 4th) to return to parliament, saying it was unwise of them to set conditions for ending their boycott without voting laws. 
The majority is open and willing to co-operation, Meta said, calling on the Socialist Party (SP) to do its part of carrying out reforms by offering proposals. 
"Those who want transparency should work for it now," Meta insisted. 
The opposition SP recently resumed a parliamentary boycott insisting the government should agree to investigate the transparency of the June 2009 general elections.

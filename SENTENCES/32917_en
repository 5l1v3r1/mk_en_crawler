TIRANA, Albania -- The government will launch negotiations in July on a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, the chief negotiator for the Albanian side, Adriana Civici, said Wednesday (28 May). 
The free trade regime envisions the gradual removal of customs duties on Albanian goods entering the Eurozone. 
Civici added that the agreement would represent the largest step yet taken in the trade liberalisation process.

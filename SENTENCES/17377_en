ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE Mission and the UNHCR office in Zagreb on Tuesday (February 27th) jointly urged for the uniform implementation of Croatia's law on foreigners, to determine former residents' status. 
The issue was the focus of a conference in Opatija. 
According to the UNHCR, some 3,700 returnees have been granted legal status in Croatia since 1998, but around 900 refugees remain in three neighbouring countries. 
The EU Partnership Agreement regards the new law on foreigners, which enables returnees who were residents in 1991 to get Croatian citizenship, as a priority.

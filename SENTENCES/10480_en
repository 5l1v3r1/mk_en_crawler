THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided Wednesday (15 September) to suspend Slobodan Milosevic's trial until 12 October to allow lawyers to prepare their case.
Steven Kay, the British court-appointed defence counsel, told the court that he is getting no co-operation from the defendant and needs to contact witnesses to arrange for their appearance before the judges.
He also said that 20 out of 23 witnesses approached by him had declined to testify.
Milosevic, who refuses to recognise the legitimacy of the court or his own lawyers, denied having influenced the witnesses' decision.
In other news Wednesday, Croatia protested the UN tribunal's refusal to grant provisional release to two Croatian generals.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader told parliament his government would still try to arrange the release on bail of Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac.
President Stipe Mesic said later that he had been told that the court's refusal was due to the fact that one other key suspect, General Ante Gotovina, remains at large.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Serbian national air carrier JAT has returned the second plane that they leased to the Macedonian flagship carrier MAT. 
On Serbian government orders, the first leased plane was not returned to MAT, according to a Macedonian media report on Thursday (11 August). 
MAT claims that all of its scheduled flights are being carried out, despite the summer high season. 
To compensate for the lost airplane, MAT will lease a plane from Bulgaria. 
The dispute between the two countries stems from the imprisonment of a Serbian Orthodox Church bishop in Macedonia.

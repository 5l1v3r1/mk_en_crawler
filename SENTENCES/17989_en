TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament will try again on Friday (July 20th) to elect a successor to outgoing President Alfred Moisiu, whose term ends next week. 
Lawmakers will choose between candidates Bamir Topi of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and Neritan Ceka from the Democratic Alliance Party. 
Earlier rounds have failed in part because of boycotts by the left-wing opposition, who say the DP-led majority has ignored an agreement to nominate a consensus candidate.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) issued a final warning to Greece Tuesday (18 October), threatening legal action for failing to comply with EU water quality laws. 
According an EC press statement, Greece and fellow EU members Italy and Spain failed to submit reports on the state of their rivers, lakes and groundwater as well as environmental studies by the deadlines. 
Unless Greece responds to the EC's warning by mid-December, Athens will be brought before the European Court of Justice.

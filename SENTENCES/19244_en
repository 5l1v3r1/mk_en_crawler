TIRANA, Albania -- The fund for the reconstruction of houses damaged in the Gerdec munitions explosion in mid-March will start allocating money to victims Monday (March 31st).
The 2.6m-euro fund was established by the government last week.
The funds will be distributed through bank branches in Vlora, the city nearest to Gerdec, where a series of powerful munitions blasts killed at least 24 people living and working in the area.
More than 4,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed and require funds for rebuilding.
Interior Minister Bujar Nishani has vowed that every application for compensation will be given careful consideration.

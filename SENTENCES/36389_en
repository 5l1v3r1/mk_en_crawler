SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR is vetting the 12 new candidates for generals' posts in the future BiH armed forces, said SFOR spokesman Captain Robert Lapreze on Tuesday (18 May). 
No deadline has been set for completion of the process.
In other news, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic says that NATO's decision to invite the country to join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme would depend on the outcome of talks later this month between NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and authorities in Sarajevo. 
Radovanovic repeated that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains a key condition for PfP membership.
In Mostar, meanwhile, a committee established to draft confidence-building measures has come up with four projects aimed at unifying the divided city. 
The emphasis is on practicality, including better irrigation and water purification systems.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday (September 6th) called on all citizens to vote in the September 12th referendum on constitutional amendments.
Addressing tens of thousands of people who had gathered in the Kurdish-dominated southeast city of Sanliurfa, Erdogan said Turkish people "must vote free from any pressure and threat" and said every security measure has been taken to guarantee a safe and peaceful process.
The statement came after the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party announced it would boycott the referendum to protest the existing 10% threshold a candidate must meet to win a seat in parliament.

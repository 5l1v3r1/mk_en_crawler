BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dozens of police sealed off the town of Foca in Republika Srpska (RS) early on Saturday (30 October) in a futile attempt to arrest war crimes suspect Gojko Jankovic. 
He is one of five people indicted for the 1992 ethnic cleansing campaign in Foca. 
One of the suspects was killed when he resisted arrest by SFOR troops and two are already serving sentences handed down by the UN tribunal. 
RS authorities have not arrested a single suspect to date.
In other news, a US State Department official said on Friday that the United States, the EU and the Office of the High Representative in BiH are discussing sanctions against "institutions and individuals who are obstructing arrests of war crimes suspects" in BiH. 
Raffi Gregorian, deputy director for BiH with the State Department's Office of South Central European Affairs, explained that financial and political penalties would be imposed.

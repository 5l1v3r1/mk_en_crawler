ANKARA, Turkey -- The general staff of the Turkish Armed Forces decided on Monday (8 September) to reduce the number of troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. 
According to an official statement, the reduction is in accordance with a NATO decision to decrease the number of peacekeepers helping to maintain security in the Balkans.
In other news, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Monday that he believes Turkey will eventually become a member of the EU, as arguments to the contrary are not convincing. 
He described Turkey as a stabilising factor in the region and said this role should not be underestimated.

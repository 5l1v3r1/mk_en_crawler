BELGRADE, Serbia -- An Iraqi military delegation has arrived in Serbia to bring back 19 Russian-made fighter planes that Saddam Hussein's regime had sent for repair, Iraqi Defence Ministry spokesperson General Mohammed al-Askari announced on Saturday (August 29th).
General Othman al-Fredji, adviser at the Defence Ministry, and Air Force head Anwar Mohammed Amin are negotiating with Serbia to maintain and return the 19 MIG-21 and 23 warplanes as soon as possible.
The aircraft were delivered to Serbia in 1989.
Before collapsing in the 1990s, the former Yugoslavia was an important weapons supplier for Iraq.

NEW YORK, United States -- The head of the UN Security Council fact-finding mission, Belgian UN Ambassador Johan Verbeke, briefed the Council Wednesday (May 2nd) on the results of the recent visit to Pristina, Belgrade, Brussels and Vienna. 
He told them the Kosovo ethnic Albanian and Serb communities remain split in their views of the future, adding that building a multiethnic society would require a "substantial effort".
Also on Wednesday, some 3,000 Kosovar Albanians rallied in Pristina on behalf of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who is currently standing a trial before the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army is charged with crimes against fellow Albanians and non-Albanians during the 1998-1999 conflict.

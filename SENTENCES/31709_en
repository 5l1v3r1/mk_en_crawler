BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro may enter NATO's Partnership for Peace programme as early as June, according to Veljko Kadijevic, the head of Atlantic Council of Serbia-Montenegro. 
He said on Tuesday (8 April) that the country is likely to make major progress towards meeting entry requirements in the next month or so, especially in terms of demonstrating "concrete results" in the area of war crimes co-operation. 
He noted, however, that charges Serbia filed against NATO countries in the International of Court of Justice over the 1999 bombing of Belgrade could be a major stumbling block. 
He suggested the charges be dropped.

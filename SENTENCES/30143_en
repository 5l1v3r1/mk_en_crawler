BERLIN, Germany -- Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Wednesday (January 19th) that his country will not force asylum seekers to return to Greece despite an EU-wide rule that asylum requests should be processed in the migrants' country of entrance to the bloc.
The measure will be valid for one year and aims to help Greek authorities deal with the huge number of asylum seekers.
According to Germany, during this one year, Greek authorities are expected to make significant progress in coping with the problem.
Similar steps have been taken by Sweden, Iceland, the UK and Norway.

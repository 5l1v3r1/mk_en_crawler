BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 500 farmers protested on Wednesday (October 28th) outside the presidency building in Bucharest, demanding subsidies they were promised.
They argue the government has not paid any of their 10-euro subsidy per sheep or goat, and only 35% of their subsidies for cows.
Earlier in the day, the farmers protested outside the finance and agriculture ministries.
They tried to break through a police cordon to enter the finance ministry building but were stopped by hundreds of gendarmerie officers sent to the scene.
President Traian Basescu met with a delegation of farmers in the afternoon, after initially declining the meeting.
Trade union representatives said they would insist on receiving their money before the November 22nd presidential elections.

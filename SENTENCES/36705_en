SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown and Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic met on Tuesday (27 July) to discuss possible ways to resolve the current cabinet situation. 
Ashdown recently dismissed the RS interior and industry ministers, accusing them and dozens of other political figures of obstructing co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
Both Ashdown and Mikerevic pledged to resolve the issue so the work of BiH institutions is not interrupted.

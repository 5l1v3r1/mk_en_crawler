SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several hundred people demonstrated outside the US Embassy in Sarajevo on Thursday (January 8th) against the Israeli military operation in Gaza.
The protesters carried posters reading "Srebrenica 1995 -- Gaza 2009" and "Palestine is another Bosnia".
They demanded that Washington pressure Israel into ending its offensive against Hamas militants.
Government officials have said that Palestinians injured in the conflict can receive treatment at hospitals in three BiH cities, including Sarajevo.

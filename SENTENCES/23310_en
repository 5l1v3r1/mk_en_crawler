PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has taken over an organ trafficking case that allegedly victimised Serbs in 1999, local media reported on Tuesday (March 31st). 
EULEX officials said they have received a file from Serb judicial authorities, in which prosecutors argue that the Kosovo Liberation Army removed the organs of Serb hostages in a house in northern Albania. 
UNMIK delivered its own file on the case to Serbian prosecutors earlier. 
Kosovo authorities say they are open to any investigation. 
"We are certain that no such crimes have been committed," Justice Minister Nekibe Kelmendi said.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader expects the EU to decide at its 2 October summit whether to unblock membership talks with Croatia.
In an interview published in Monday's (26 September) Belgrade-based daily Danas, Sanader reiterated his claim that Zagreb is fully co-operating with the UN tribunal.
The membership talks have been held up for months over Croatia's failure to arrest fugitive war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina.
Zagreb insists he is not in Croatia.
In other news, Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic said in Washington on Friday that the country would accede to NATO in 2008 at the earliest.
She predicted next year's NATO summit would be dedicated to the Pact's consolidation, rather than expansion.
Also Friday, a local court in Osijek, Croatia charged a former Croatian Army member with war crimes against ethnic Serb civilians.
The investigative judge in the case announced that Fred Margus -- along with a group of other soldiers, whose identities have not been established -- is responsible for the murder of two Serb civilians from Osijek on 7 December 1991.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Parliament President Pat Cox arrived in Zagreb late Sunday (28 September) for a four-day visit to Southeast Europe with stops in Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
In Croatia, Cox is expected to meet with Parliamentary Speaker Zlatko Tomcic, President Stipe Mesic, representatives of parties in parliament and ambassadors of EU member countries.
In other news, Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan left Sunday for a two-day working visit to London. 
At issue is the British Parliament's continued refusal to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Croatia and the EU. 
London has conditioned it on the surrender or arrest of fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina.

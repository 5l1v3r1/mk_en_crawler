SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown and EU Police Mission (EUPM) Commissioner Sven Frederiksen met senior BiH police officers in Sarajevo on Friday (10 January). 
Addressing the participants, Ashdown highlighted the EU's increasing role in the country and said the EUPM was concrete proof of the Union's commitment to regional stability. 
"The EU has shown that it does not have an exit strategy for the Balkans, but rather an entry strategy that ends with EU membership", Ashdown said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Five people, including tourists from Britain and Ireland, died when an explosion ripped apart the minivan in which they were riding Saturday (16 July). 
Thirteen people were injured. 
The blast occurred in the popular resort town of Kisadasi. 
Authorities are investigating a report that a young female suicide bomber may have blown up the van. 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the blast as "a terrorist attack" but did not blame any particular group. 
A Kurdish rebel commander also denounced the attack in a statement for a German-based Kurdish news agency. 
Security has been tightened at all resorts, in the wake of Saturday's blast and one six days earlier that injured 20 people.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia arrested six former members of a paramilitary squad suspected of murdering Serbs during the 1991-1995 conflict, according to a police report Saturday (October 21st). 
The detainees -- five men and a woman -- will be charged with tying the victims' hands, putting tape on their mouths and throwing them into the Drina River near Osijek. 
The police believe that at least 37 Serbs were murdered by the group in 1991 and early 1992. 
The perpetrators were reportedly seeking revenge for the heavy bombardment of Osijek earlier in 1991. 
Human rights groups have been pushing the Croatian authorities to investigate reports of the Osijek murders for many years.

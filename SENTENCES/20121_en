SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament held a special session on Thursday (August 16th) to decide whether to lift former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's immunity from prosecution. 
A decision is expected on Friday. 
Prosecutors want to indict the opposition lawmaker in connection with a 2001 defence contract that cost the country an estimated 3m euros in losses. 
Former Army Chief of Staff General Metodi Stamboliski already has been indicted for placing an order with a private local firm for triple the number of tank spare parts actually needed. 
Buckovski was defence minister at the time.

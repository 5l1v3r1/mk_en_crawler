BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers decided on Monday (December 10th) to add two new chapters to its negotiating agenda with Turkey next week, disregarding France's concerns over the country's accession.
The chapters will be on health and consumer affairs policy and trans-European networks.
France, however, did win a symbolic victory by managing to persuade the EU not to use the terms "accession" and "membership" in its statement on Turkey's EU negotiations and the union's expansion strategy.
These words were instead replaced by "intergovernmental conferences" with Turkey.
In a statement Tuesday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry expressed disappointment with the resolution adopted by the foreign ministers.
The ministry said that referring to Turkey's membership aspirations and commitments in such a roundabout way has sparked strong public reaction.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov was unanimously elected as the new chairman of the ruling Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party Sunday (January 10th).
He will replace Tsvetan Tsvetanov at the party's helm.
Borisov, who was previously mayor of Sofia, previously did not become party leader due to legislation that barred mayors from becoming party chairmen.
Tsvetanov will now become second in command.
Despite the formal change in leadership, the party's political course remains unchanged.

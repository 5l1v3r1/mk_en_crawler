SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board gathered on Tuesday (June 29th) in Sarajevo for a two-day meeting.
After a briefing from Security Minister Sadik Ahmetovic about Sunday's pre-dawn attack on a police station in Bugojno that killed a police officer, the Board condemned it as "an attack ...
on institutions of this country and on our common values".
The Steering Board stressed that any attempt to use terror to advance political aims is unacceptable and voiced support for local law enforcement and security agencies.
The Board is also discussing the lack of progress in meeting all five objectives and two conditions required to close the Office of High Representative.
Other topics included BiH's bids to join NATO and the EU, and the political situation ahead of the October general elections.

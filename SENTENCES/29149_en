THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele and UN war crimes tribunal Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz reiterated on Wednesday (October 6th) that the arrest of war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic must remain a priority.
The two officials were briefing members of the Dutch parliament's European Affairs Committee about Belgrade's co-operation with the tribunal, in view of its EU integration bid.
Brammertz said the EU should maintain its pressure on Serbia to arrest Mladic.
Fuele called on Dutch lawmakers to support Serbia's EU membership application and its forwarding to the European Commission for assessment.
At the same time, he insisted that full co-operation with the tribunal will remain a pre-condition for integration into the bloc.
The Netherlands is the only EU country that has threatened to block Serbia's accession if the country does not capture Mladic and Hadzic and hand them over to the UN tribunal.

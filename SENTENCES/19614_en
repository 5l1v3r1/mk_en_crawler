ANKARA, Turkey -- Two ethnic Kurds died on Sunday (March 23rd) during clashes with police in an area in the southeast gripped by protests for four days.
What began as part of the celebrations marking the Nawruz spring holiday grew into violent demonstrations in support of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Around 200 people were injured and another 200 were arrested.
One victim died of bullet wounds in the town of Yuksekova while the other died in Van.
Demonstrations have spread into the provinces of Siirt, Hakkari and Van.
The situation Sunday was especially tense in Hakkari, where thousands of Kurds joined a pro-PKK rally, pelting police with rocks and bottles.
The officers used tear gas to disperse the crowd.
Three officers were badly injured in an explosion, according to the Dogan news agency.
The situation was also tense in Istanbul, where another big rally was held.
Thousands of Kurds chanted slogans in support of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence in prison.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Public debate on a draft prosecution law began in Macedonia on Tuesday (October 24th). 
According to the bill, the appointment and dismissal of prosecutors would be the responsibility of the Prosecution Council. 
The only exception would be the chief prosecutor, who would be selected by parliament. 
Another proposal would establish a special prosecution office to fight organised crime and corruption. 
It would be fully independent, under the supervision of the chief prosecutor.

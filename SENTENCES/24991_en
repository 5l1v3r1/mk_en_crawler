SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Ivica Bocevski resigned on Tuesday (June 30th), telling Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski that he has done all he can. 
"Each generation has its own battle for Macedonia, and my generation had to fight for European and Euro-Atlantic Macedonia," read a letter to Gruevski. 
Bocevski added that until a replacement is appointed, State Secretary Pero Dimsoski will carry out his duties.
While Gruevski's cabinet thanked Bocevski for his efforts, the opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia suggested the resignation stemmed from the EU's negative assessment of Macedonia's progress.

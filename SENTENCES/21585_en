PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An Albanian group claimed responsibility Thursday (November 27th) for the grenade attack two weeks ago on the Implementation Civilian Office's (ICO) headquarters in Pristina. 
The group, calling itself the Army of the Republic of Kosovo (ARK), sent e-mails to the Kosovo government, media and international organisations warning that similar attacks against the Serb minority may follow. 
ARK opposes the plan for reconfiguring the international presence in Kosovo, which the UN Security Council adopted on Wednesday. 
Police spokesperson Veton Elshani told DPA on Thursday that ARK's threats seem serious and are being investigated. 
Three Germans were arrested last week in connection with the attack on the ICO headquarters and ordered held for 30 days. 
The German Federal Intelligence Agency (BND) confirms the three are BND agents but insists they had nothing to do with the attack.

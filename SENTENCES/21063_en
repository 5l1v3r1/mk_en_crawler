ATHENS, Greece -- The UNHCR demanded on Tuesday (October 2nd) the immediate shutdown of a detention centre for illegal immigrants on the Greek Aegean island of Samos, citing appalling conditions there. 
In a press release published after inspectors visited the centre Monday, the UNHCR said conditions were an "insult to human dignity" and violated human rights. 
The facility, located in a former tobacco warehouse on the island has a capacity of 120 people. 
It currently houses 391 illegal immigrants, mostly women and children from Asia. 
"Cholera could break out at any time," said one official. 
A new facility is being built.

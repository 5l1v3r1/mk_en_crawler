ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission (EC) has advised Croatia and Slovenia to reach a bilateral settlement in their dispute over establishment of a maritime economic zone in the Adriatic, saying resolving such arguments is not its responsibility.
Spokeswoman Emma Udwin told the Croatian news agency HINA that the EC was in touch with both sides and expected them to solve the dispute through dialogue.
She also expressed hope that Slovenia's ambassador to Croatia, who was withdrawn by Ljubljana last week for "consultations", would soon return to his post.
In other news, Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan confirmed Wednesday (3 September) that the next parliamentary elections would be held in late November, probably on the 23rd.
He reiterated that the current priority is to complete a lengthy questionnaire that is crucial to potential EU accession.

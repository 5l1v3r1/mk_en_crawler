TIRANA, Albania -- Several objects found in the Adriatic Sea a few days ago did not belong to a helicopter which crashed last week, killing former Albanian Deputy Prime Minister Gramoz Pashko and five others, Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu announced on Friday (21 July). 
He said tests refuted the initial assumptions that the objects had been retrieved from the helicopter. 
The search is continuing, he added.

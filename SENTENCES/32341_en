BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government approved a plan of priority measures towards European integration Thursday (31 October). 
The action plan will include the period of November 2002 - December 2003. 
It suggests that urgent measures will be taken both before and after NATO's Prague summit in late November. 
According to the plan, Romania intends to open all negotiation chapters with the EU and close four more by the end of the Danish Presidency over the European Council.

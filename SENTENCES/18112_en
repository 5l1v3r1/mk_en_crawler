ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Friday (June 15th) that he has invited Iraqi counterpart Nouri al-Maliki to visit Ankara for talks on cross-border issues and the fight against the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
Relations between Turkey and Iraq have grown strained lately amid allegations of PKK bases in northern Iraq and warnings from Turkey that it might launch a cross-border operation.

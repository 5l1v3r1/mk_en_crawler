BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) is not talking with the Socialists about forming a new cabinet, DSS official Rade Obradovic said Monday (9 February).
Talks are aimed at the democratic bloc, he said, adding that it is up to other parties outside the bloc to decide whether to support the government.
"There have been no negotiations with the Socialists, nor have they been promised anything," Obradovic said.
At the same time, he confirmed that talks with the Democratic Party are over.

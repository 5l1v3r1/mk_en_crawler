BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Radical Party (SRS), the Democratic Party-New Serbia (DSS-NS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) agreed in principle on formation of a government at their meeting Thursday (May 15th). 
The DSS says the three parties agreed to continue talks on a government that would protect Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, ensure strong economic development, achieve social justice, continue the EU integration process of Serbia with Kosovo and fight crime and corruption. 
No one party won enough votes to form a majority government in Sunday's election.

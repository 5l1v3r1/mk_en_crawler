NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot government does not expect a reunification deal or a referendum on it by the end of the year, unless Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots change their stances in ongoing talks, government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said on Tuesday (July 14th). 
"As things stand now ... 
we don't see how a settlement could be agreed on and put to a referendum by December," he told reporters. 
On Monday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Ankara wants a referendum this year, a sentiment Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat echoed on Tuesday. 
"If the process speeds up and the Greek Cypriot administration co-operates, we target to complete the negotiations at the end of 2009," he said. 
That would allow a referendum early in 2010.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament approved the budget for 2008, which envisions a 6.0% rise in GDP, on Wednesday (December 26th).
Next year's budget is 9.9% higher than the one for 2007;
revenues are expected to reach 7.8 billion euros, while spending is set at 7.98 billion euros.
The deficit of 185m euros will be covered by privatisation, loans and donations, the government announced.
The inflation rate is expected to be around 6%.
The largest share of spending is earmarked for the salaries of public clerks.
The vote by parliament was originally expected on December 15th but was delayed due to the Kosovo status process and a resolution Wednesday condemning any attempt by Kosovo to become independent.

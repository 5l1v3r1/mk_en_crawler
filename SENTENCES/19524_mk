ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on Saturday (November 24th) to expand the democratic rights of the Kurdish community in Turkey, saying this would help undermine support for separatism and neutralise the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) positions. 
Erdogan's statement came after local media reports suggested his government is considering a plan to win over the Kurds and undermine support for the PKK.
In other news, the daily Hurriyet reported on Saturday that Turkey and the United States have agreed to establish a joint intelligence centre in their efforts to curb the PKK in northern Iraq. 
The agreement was reached during last week's meeting between Vice Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright and the deputy chief of the Turkish general staff, Ergin Saygun.

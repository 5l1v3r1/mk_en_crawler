SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Slovenia firmly backs Macedonia's candidacy for EU and NATO membership and would lobby for the acceleration of this process, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said in Skopje on Tuesday (February 27th).
However, in talks with Macedonia counterpart Nikola Gruevski, he noted that political dialogue -- problematic right now-- is necessary for the country to speed up reforms.
He urged both the ruling majority and the opposition to pursue this goal.
Macedonia hopes to receive a date for starting accession talks in 2008.

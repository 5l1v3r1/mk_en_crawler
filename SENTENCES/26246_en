BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet chose Dacian Ciolos as Romania's candidate for the new European Commission (EC) on Monday (October 12th). 
Ciolos has been advising President Traian Basescu on agricultural issues and it is Basescu who must approve his nomination. 
Romania has its eye on the EC agriculture portfolio, but it may be unlikely. 
Several Romanian newspapers recently quoted sources from Brussels as saying that Romania had no shot at it or any other post involving control over EU funds. 
The same sources say that EC President Jose Manuel Barroso has told Basescu as much.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Branko Lukovac said Monday (1 September) that no obstacles remain to starting work on a feasibility study for the country's EU accession, now that the federal parliament has adopted the action plan on economic harmonisation. 
Belgrade-based B92 reports that the European Commission will initiate work on the study within days and that it could take a minimum of six months to complete.
In other news Monday, acting Serbian President Natasa Micic said that progress made in drafting a new Serbian Constitution would determine the date of the next presidential election. 
Micic, who also serves as parliament speaker, said she will not run for president as her workload over the past year has been overwhelming.

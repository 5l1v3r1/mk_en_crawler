BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, whose country assumes the rotating EU presidency on Saturday (1 July), says that Southeast Europe and countries' EU integration will be priorities during its mandate.
Speaking Thursday in Brussels, Tuomioja said Finland approaches EU enlargement openly and would insist on objective evaluations and implementation of all membership criteria on a country-by-country basis.
"It is important not to send wrong signals to future applicants, as the European perspective is a strong weapon for the EU, especially in the Western Balkans," he said.

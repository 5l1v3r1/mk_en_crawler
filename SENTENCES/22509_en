BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police said on Sunday (June 8th) they detained a 29-year-old bank clerk suspected of stealing about 1.4m euros.
The suspect, identified only as Aleksandar S., was a chief cashier at Raiffeisen Bank in Kragujevac in central Serbia.
He allegedly took the money from the main vault Saturday morning and walked out with it in a bag.
Before leaving, he reportedly wrote a note to his boss apologising for his action.
Police detained him Saturday afternoon, shortly after bankers discovered the theft.
The money remains missing.

ATHENS, Greece -- Five police officers working at the Patras harbour have been charged with belonging to a crime group that smuggled illegal immigrants into Italy, Merchant Marine Minister Anastassis Papaligouras announced on Thursday (November 27th).
The policemen were among a group of eight arrested at the port Wednesday.
Investigators say the group operated for the past two years and charged each potential immigrant between 3,000 and 5,000 euros to get them into Italy.

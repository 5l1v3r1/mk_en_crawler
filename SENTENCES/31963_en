SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Anti-Corruption Commission ruled Monday (25 November) that officials of the former VMRO-DPMNE-led cabinet are required to fill out financial statements, as are members of the current government. 
The commission also set a 30-day limit for all respondents - senior officials in government, parliament and state-run companies - to submit the confidential data. 
The panel wants a record of individual holdings to track any unusual increases.

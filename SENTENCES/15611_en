TIRANA, Albania -- A senior official of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP), Pandeli Majko, asked the OSCE Presence in Albania to help resolve the ongoing political crisis Monday (21 August).
Majko said the OSCE's role would be that of mediator between the ruling and opposition parties, rather than provider of a ready recipe.
Following months of squabbling over institutional and electoral issues with the ruling Democratic Party, the SP recently threatened to boycott the next municipal elections unless the parliamentary majority complies with its demands for electoral reform.

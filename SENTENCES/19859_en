BELGRADE, Serbia -- The youth organisation Mlada Bosnia (Young Bosnia) announced in an e-mail Tuesday (February 19th) that it was responsible for recent explosions in front of a store in Belgrade near the headquarters of the European Mission in Mitrovica. 
The group, named after the resistance movement whose members assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, said they were responding to the "irresponsible measures of the so-called Kosovo parliament and Western powers". 
They called for the partition of Kosovo and a declaration of independence by Republika Srpska.

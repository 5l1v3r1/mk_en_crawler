SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH and Serbia-Montenegro diplomats offer different views about the possible impact of the ongoing case at the International Court of Justice dealing with BiH's genocide claim against the federal union.
Sunday's (14 May) edition of Dnevni avaz daily quoted BiH Ambassador to Belgrade Tomislav Leko as saying that the issue must not affect mutual ties, which he described as "good, friendly and constantly improving".
Leko's statement came two days after Serbia-Montenegro's new Ambassador to BiH, Grujica Spasovic, said that whatever the outcome of the court procedure, it would damage bilateral ties.
Spasovic, who visited Banja Luka on Friday, said the issue should have been resolved in some other way.

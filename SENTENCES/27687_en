PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo has received approval from the EU's statistical office, EUROSTAT, to begin the population and households census in April 2011, media reported on Friday (November 26th).
In Pristina, EUROSTAT official Pieter Everaers said that Kosovo is ready to conduct the census in spring "based on highest international standards".
He added that while some technical issues remain, the main points have already been addressed.
Everaers said he expects Kosovo Serbs to participate in the process, as it is a technical rather than political one.
This will be the first census held in Kosovo in 30 years.

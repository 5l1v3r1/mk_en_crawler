TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) expressed concern Wednesday (September 26th) about the economic situation in Albania resulting from the government's decision to spend the state budget, purportedly without specific cost projections.
SMI says that attitude will burden future generations.
According to SMI, the government should take immediate action to address rising consumer prices, the power crisis, and hikes in oil prices.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament will discuss a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition Movement for Changes (PzP) on April 13th, PzP official Srdjan Brajovic said on Monday (March 29th). 
Two other opposition parties support the initiative: the Socialist People's Party and the New Serbian Democracy. 
The opposition accuses the government of failing to fight corruption and organised crime, as well as inefficiency in addressing the economic situation.

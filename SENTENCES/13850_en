ATHENS, Greece -- During a visit by Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos to Athens on Thursday (18 August), Greece and Cyprus agreed on a common stance regarding Turkey's bid for EU membership.
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said they would present their joint position at next week's session of the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels.
There has been speculation that Turkey's refusal to recognise Cyprus would delay the launch of EU accession negotiations with Ankara on 3 October.

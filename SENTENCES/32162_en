BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Parliament adjourned Tuesday (12 November) after members failed to agree on the agenda.
Despite last week's agreement between President Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, aimed at unblocking the Serbian legislature, DSS joined the opposition in voting against the proposed DOS agenda.
Parliament was scheduled to debate new tax legislation on sales, profit, property and income tax, as well as amendments to excise tax laws.
DSS claims it did not have enough time to study the legislation.
Meanwhile, Montenegro's main opposition party, the Socialist People's Party (SNP) announced Tuesday it will boycott parliamentary sessions.
The SNP said it did not want to be a mere decoration.
Parliament continued its work in spite of the boycott, adopting amendments to the media law.

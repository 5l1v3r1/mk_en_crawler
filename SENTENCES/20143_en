BUCHAREST, Romania -- Interior Minister Cristian David says Romania and Bulgaria will sign a document in June on bilateral strategic co-operation in protecting borders of the two countries.
This is part of their efforts to join the EU's Schengen common border control and visa space together in March 2011.
David announced the move on Sunday (March 16th) after meeting with Bulgarian counterpart, Rumen Petkov, at the Romanian resort of Mamaya.
The two ministers discussed projects aimed at boosting border security and co-operation in fighting organised crime.
They also talked about co-operation in the Black Sea area and the Danube River.
Bulgarian authorities have already invested 2m euros in a video surveillance system along their shore.

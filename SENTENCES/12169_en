BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who is also chairman of the federal council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, has again called on indicted Serb generals Nebojsa Pavkovic and Sreten Lukic to surrender. 
In comments that appeared in Saturday's (12 March) Vecernje novosti, Ljajic said that the UN tribunal would not give up and that the two could not hide forever. 
He added that the behaviour of the two generals, both of whom are wanted for alleged war crimes in Kosovo, is limiting their chances of potential release on bail or of being tried in Serbia-Montenegro.
In other news Saturday, Serbia's political leaders and more than 1,000 others visited Belgrade's New Cemetery to mark the second anniversary of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination. 
He was gunned down in what was seen as a criminal plot against the democratisation of the country.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia has not formally asked to change the Kumanovo Agreement, an accord that made Belgrade pull its troops out of Kosovo in 1999, NATO spokesman James Appathurai said on Monday (December 1st) ahead of a discussion Tuesday by NATO member states regarding the situation in Kosovo.
In an interview Saturday with the Belgrade-based daily Politika, Serbian President Boris Tadic said his country has proved to be a stabilising factor in the region and that the Kumanovo Agreement deserves review.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A roadside bomb, reportedly detonated by Kurdish militants in southeastern Turkey, killed three Turkish soldiers on Saturday (August 4th).
One soldier was wounded.
Eleven people died in clashes with the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party earlier in the week, and militants are also said to have kidnapped eight people near the Iranian border.
On Sunday, the Anadolu news agency said a Turkish villager was killed by Kurdish militants in southeastern Turkey because he refused to give them food and supplies.
The incident follows a similar murder late last month.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian President Boris Tadic reiterated on Friday (March, 18th) that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence.
In an interview with Klan Kosova TV he said that the interests of Kosovo Serbs should be respected and protected, while a solution is sought for problems in Kosovo.
Tadic voiced hope that the initial stage of talks between Belgrade and Pristina on technical issues would be followed by search for solution to the dispute between Serbs and Albanians.

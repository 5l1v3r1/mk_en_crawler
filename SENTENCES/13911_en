THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (16 November) acquitted a former chief of staff of the Bosnian Army of murder charges stemming from the killing of 62 Bosnian Croat civilians and a prisoner of war in Grabovica in 1993.
The three judges acknowledged that the murders had taken place but said prosecutors had failed to prove that Sefer Halilovic had effective control over the unit that carried them out.
In other news, Slobodan Milosevic's trial was suspended Wednesday when the defendant said he was unwell and could not remain in the courtroom.
He had filed a petition Tuesday to have the trial suspended for six weeks due to health problems.

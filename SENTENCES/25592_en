BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (October 22nd) that he expects the government to find a way out of the political standstill that has plagued Albania since the June 28th general elections.
The opposition Socialist Party insists the voting process was "manipulated" and has boycotted work in parliament until an investigation is conducted.
Speaking in Brussels, Rehn said the Albanian government must demonstrate more commitment to political stability and evolve its European orientation.

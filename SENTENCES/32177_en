NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday (11 November) submitted to Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash a plan for a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem. 
The plan is based on the so-called Switzerland Model, which envisions two sovereign Turkish and Greek states, represented internationally under one umbrella, as the parties are to negotiate exact borders later. 
Annan's plan also proposes a gradual reduction in the military forces of the guarantor states, Turkey and Greece, deployed on the island. 
Annan requests feedback from each side within a week.

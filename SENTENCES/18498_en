ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul phoned US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Saturday (April 7th) to discuss a comment by Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.
Earlier that day Barzani urged Turkey not to interfere in the Kurds' bid to attach Iraq's oil-rich city of Kirkuk to the Kurdish semi-autonomous zone.
He added that if Turkey does not comply, Iraq's Kurds will respond by intervening in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast, where insurgents have battled for decades to establish autonomy.
"There are 30 million Kurds in Turkey and we don't interfere there," Barzani was quoted as saying.
Gul described the comment as a provocation.
He told Rice that Turkey expects Barzani to be warned not to repeat his threats.
In other news, eight Turkish soldiers and a village guard were killed during the weekend in clashes with members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in southeast Turkey.
Media reports Sunday described it as one of the heaviest tolls suffered by troops fighting the PKK.

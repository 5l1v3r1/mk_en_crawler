TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi is asking all political parties to work harder on reforms that are crucial to EU integration.
At a judicial sector meeting Monday (March 8th), Topi said the contribution expected from the opposition to adopt pending measures in parliament goes beyond party interests.
Topi mediated talks last month between the opposition Socialist Party (SP) and the ruling Democratic Party that eventually ended the SP's lengthy boycott of parliament.
Since its return, the party has focused only on issues that concern it.

PARIS, France -- The Bulgarian government is backing out of a deal to buy four battleships -- corvettes -- from France.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov informed French President Nicolas Sarkozy of the decision as they met in Paris on Monday (October 12th).
The billion-euro deal was struck by the previous Bulgarian cabinet.
The global financial crisis and Bulgaria's own budget deficit prompted the cancellation.
"Luckily, Mr. Sarkozy demonstrated understanding because he knows Bulgaria's financial situation," Borisov said.
Earlier in the day, Borisov met with French counterpart Francois Fillon who said he will ask French power companies whether they want to help build a second nuclear plant in Bulgaria.
The project currently lacks sufficient financing.

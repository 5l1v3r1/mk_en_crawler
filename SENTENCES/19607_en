BELGRADE, Serbia -- It would be unwise to hold presidential elections when the country's territorial integrity is being questioned, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, chairman of the Democratic Party of Serbia, told the newspaper Vecernje Novosti on Saturday (September 22nd). 
Kostunica argued that Serbia should focus all its energy and efforts on resolving the Kosovo issue. 
He refused to say whether his party will support Democratic Party (DS) leader Boris Tadic's re-election bid, noting only that "attention should be directed towards the defence of Kosovo".
DS and the other parties in the ruling coalition -- New Serbia and G17 Plus -- want the presidential and local elections held on schedule, that is, by the end of the year.

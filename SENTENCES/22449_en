BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Council of Ministers approved a proposal Tuesday (October 14th) for US participation in the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo. 
Washington has assured that its officials will "participate in the mission in accordance with the EULEX joint action and operational plan". 
Under the agreement, EULEX Commander Yves de Kermabon will command and control all teams and units, which now include 500 international members and around 200 local staff. 
Kosovo officials say deployment is considered an "immediate need".
In other news Tuesday, Finance Minister Ahmet Shala said Kosovo is likely to become a member of the IMF and the World Bank shortly, probably next year. 
During an official visit to Washington, Shala told the BBC that the majority of IMF member states support Kosovo's membership. 
Serbia and Russia would be unable to block the move, he added.
Also Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates recognised Kosovo's independence, the first Arab country to do so. 
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg announced they are recognising Kosovo's newly issued passports.
Meanwhile, the strike by healthcare workers in Kosovo ended on Tuesday after their trade union and the government agreed on a pay raise, starting in January.

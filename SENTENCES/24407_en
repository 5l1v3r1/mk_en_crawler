ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament member Branimir Glavas has fled the country after a court sentenced him to ten years in prison for war crimes committed during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s, media reported on Saturday (May 9th).
Local media say Glavas crossed the border into Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Croatia's news agency HINA quoted Bosnian security officials as saying Glavas was spotted in the southwestern town of Tomislavgrad.
A spokesman for BiH's police, however, told Serbian media they have no knowledge of this.
As a member of parliament, Glavas still has partial immunity, though he may be stripped of it early this week.
On Friday, a Zagreb court convicted him of the 1991 kidnapping, torture and murder of 12 Serbian civilians in the eastern town of Osijek, Croatia.
He was the first Croatian politician to stand trial for crimes against Serbs.

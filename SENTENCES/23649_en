BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Monday (January 26th) he may not seek another term if the current ruling coalition fails.
"If I reach the conclusion that Romanians are too affected by the economic crisis and the current cabinet cannot tackle the situation properly, even if there is a very strong parliamentary majority, I am considering the possibility of not running again for the presidency," Basescu told national TV.
"If the cabinet fails, how can I go in front of the people and ask for a new mandate?"
In other news Monday, the labour ministry announced that Germany has decided to maintain its existing labour restrictions on Romanian workers.
Berlin will, however, extend the stay period for temporary workers from four months to six.

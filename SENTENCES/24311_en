ATHENS, Greece -- A powerful bomb exploded early Tuesday (May 12th) outside a Eurobank branch in southeastern Athens, causing major property damage but no injuries.
Police said 20kg of explosives in a suitcase at the entrance of the bank constituted the bomb.
Police learned of the coming attack half an hour beforehand by an anonymous call to a local police station and the daily newspaper Eleftherotypia.
Separately, arsonists attacked the offices of Greece's Public Power Corporation in the southern Athens suburb of Agios Dimitrios, causing damage but no injuries.
Greece has endured daily bombings and episodes of arson against banks and multinational businesses since December 2008, when a police officer shot a teenager dead, triggering Greece's worst riots in decades.

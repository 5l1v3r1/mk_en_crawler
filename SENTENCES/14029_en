BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government has placed five southeastern villages in quarantine following the discovery of the bird flu virus in the area.
The deadly H5N1 strain was detected in samples sent from Bumbacari, Dudescu, Ciocile, Periprava and Agighiol earlier this month.
Officials said they were worried by the spread of the virus west of the Danube delta.
In other news, Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said his government would not allow the completion of foreign adoptions that had started before passage of a new law that bans such adoptions altogether.
Hundreds of families from the United States and Western Europe had urged the authorities to allow them to complete the adoptions.

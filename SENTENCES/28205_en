SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric announced on Thursday (November 18th) he will resign from his post on November 29th unless the Central Election Commission approves a deadline for him to assume his seat in parliament. 
Spiric won another term in the October 3rd elections as a candidate of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) but the government has been slow to form since then and faces a November 30th deadline. 
He says if nothing changes, effective on November 29th the Council of Ministers "will be in resignation". 
He added that some ministers have already begun to table their resignations. 
"I decided to take this step because I don't want to break the laws of BiH," Spiric said.
Meanwhile, Milorad Dodik, Republika Srpska's newly elected president, said on Thursday he will begin consultations to appoint his successor as the entity's next prime minister and entrust him to form the new government. 
His first meeting will be with the Serb Democratic Party, the second largest party in the entity parliament after Dodik's SNSD. 
Earlier this month, the two long-time rivals signed an agreement to co-operate, at least enough to form the state-level government. 
At the same time, the Party of Democratic Action and the Social Democratic Party, the two strongest Bosniak parties, agreed on Thursday to form a state-level coalition bloc. 
The two main Croat parties, the Croat Democratic Union of BiH and the HDZ-90, have also agreed on a state-level coalition.

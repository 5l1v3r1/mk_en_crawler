TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties wrapped up three days of protest on Sunday (November 22nd), issuing an ultimatum to the government: launch an investigation into the June 28th general elections within ten days or prepare for more protests. 
"We will make the nation stand as a single family asking for democratic values, and we won't stop until Albania has declared early elections," Socialist Party leader Edi Rama said.
Organisers claim the three-day demonstrations were the longest and biggest protests ever organised by opposition parties in Albania. 
Reacting to the weekend events, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said he is "open to a serious dialogue, but ... 
will not accept deceit". 
He added that the elections were certified by independent institutions.

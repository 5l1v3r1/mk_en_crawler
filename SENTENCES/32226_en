BUCHAREST, Romania -- The seventh meeting of Southeast Europe Defence Ministers (SEDM) wraps up in Bucharest on Friday (8 November).
Delegations from Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey, Slovenia and the United States are taking part.
Meanwhile, French Minister Delegate for European Affairs Noelle Lenoir is completing two days of talks in Sofia on bilateral co-operation and Bulgaria's EU accession preparations.
Sofia wants an EU road map drawn, and an exact date set for accession.
On another note, the presidents of Albania and Macedonia have agreed to meet later this month to discuss ways to bring both countries into NATO.
A statement issued Thursday in Tirana quoted President Alfred Moisiu as saying that the two countries are determined to work together towards that goal.

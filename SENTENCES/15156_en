STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly adopted a resolution Thursday (29 June) advising Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to draft and adopt a new constitution by October 2010, to replace the Dayton Peace Agreements.
While reaction in the Federation of BiH was largely positive, officials in Republika Srpska warned of negative consequences for BiH, as the resolution suggests the entity structure should be replaced.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A member of an expedition from the Serbian region of Vojvodina has climbed Mt Everest, the team's leader reported Saturday (28 May). 
Iso Panic scaled the planet's highest summit with a Sherpa guide and then returned safely to camp. 
High winds forced three other members of the expedition to turn back as they neared the peak. 
The expedition was organised by the Mountaineering Association of Vojvodina.

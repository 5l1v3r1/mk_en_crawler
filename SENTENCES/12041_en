ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 500 landmine removal experts protested in Zagreb on Wednesday (15 December) against the reduction of funds in their 2005 budget. 
Experts from 23 private companies said the allocated money would be enough to finance activities for only six months. 
Representatives of the protesters met with Finance Minister Ivan Suker, who pledged his support and agreed to organise a meeting on the issue in early 2005.

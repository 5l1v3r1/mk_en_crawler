SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski said on Friday (4 April) that the new EU military mission could leave Macedonia in six months because the country is returning to normal.
"EUFOR has a six-month mandate," Crvenkoski told AFP.
"We fully intend before year's end to declare that Macedonia definitively has no further need of a military presence." He added that authorities have made substantial progress in re-establishing control over areas formerly held by the rebel National Liberation Army and the police presence there was no longer merely formal.
The international presence, he said, provides an additional sense of security.

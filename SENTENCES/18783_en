SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov signed the bill on European Parliament elections Monday (March 5th), despite concerns it restricts the voting rights of expatriates.
The press had speculated that Parvanov might return the legislation to Parliament for reworking, given the support the predominantly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms provided him during his re-election last autumn.

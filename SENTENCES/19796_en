BELGRADE, Serbia -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte begins a two-day visit to Serbia on Thursday (October 25th), where she is meeting with President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and others responsible for implementing the country's action plan for co-operation with The Hague tribunal. 
Based on her findings in Belgrade, del Ponte will write a report about the country's level of war crimes co-operation, which in turn will help determine whether the EU would offer to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday that the EU is technically prepared for an SAA with Serbia, but formal initialling of the document would require Belgrade to meet some political conditions. 
The European Parliament (EP) met on Wednesday to discuss a report on Serbia drafted by EP Rapporteur Jelko Kacin.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Doris Pack, chairwoman of the European Parliament's (EP) committee for Southeast Europe, warned on Tuesday (2 May) that EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with BiH might be suspended unless the country implements promised reforms. 
Addressing participants in the 8th EP-BiH inter-parliamentary meeting in Banja Luka, she stressed that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and implementing police reform remain key conditions for the SAA process. 
She also urged BiH politicians to redouble efforts to pass a crucial package of constitutional amendments, aimed at strengthening state institutions.

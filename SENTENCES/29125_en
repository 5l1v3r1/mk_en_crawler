SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Tuesday (April 6th) that he is concerned about the political situation in BiH, but hopes the October general elections will lead to positive change. 
His comments came as he met with US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg and Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. 
The two visiting diplomats called for an election campaign focused on better living conditions for BiH citizens and reforms to bring the country closer to the EU and NATO.

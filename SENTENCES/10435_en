ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government reported on Wednesday (20 October) that it has declassified transcripts of two important meetings held by former President Franjo Tudjman towards the end of the 1991-1995 conflict. 
According to media reports, the UN war crimes tribunal used copies of these documents to indict retired General Ante Gotovina and other senior military officers. 
The transcripts reportedly contain evidence that one of the goals of the final Croatian operation during the conflict was to drive Serbs out of the Knin area. 
How the documents -- formerly considered state secrets -- ended up at The Hague is unclear. 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says the question requires investigation.

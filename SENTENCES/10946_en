SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov warned on Friday (29 July) that the latest political developments might affect plans for EU membership.
Meeting with trade union leaders in Sofia, Parvanov said the ongoing government crisis and parliamentary conflicts would reduce public trust in the larger parties and could have long-term consequences, such as deterring EU entry, currently scheduled for January 2007.
The Socialist Party came in first in the 25 June elections, but parliament rejected its slate of cabinet ministers last week.
Parvanov says he will next issue the mandate to second place finisher, NMS-II.
On Friday, NMS-II leader Simeon Saxe-Coburg said he would not seek a second term as prime minister.
He also urged the party to carefully consider coalition scenarios before accepting the mandate, expected this week.

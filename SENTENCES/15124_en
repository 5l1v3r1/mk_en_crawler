SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Brigadier General Louis W. Weber took over the command of NATO HQ in BiH from Brigadier General Steven P. Schook at a formal ceremony at Camp Butmir on Wednesday (31 August).
Schook said he was satisfied with the results achieved during his 11-month term, particularly the progress achieved in defence reforms.
But he also noted that much remains to be done, especially as regards full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Weber, in turn, voiced confidence that reforms would continue.
In other news Wednesday, the commander of NATO's south wing, US Admiral Harry Ulrich, met with the tripartite BiH presidency in Sarajevo.
Ulrich expressed confidence that the process of defence sector restructuring would be successfully implemented.

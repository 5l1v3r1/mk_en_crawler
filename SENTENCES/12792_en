SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Hundreds of jobless people protested across Bulgaria on Tuesday (4 January) against the government's plan to reduce social programmes that offer temporary employment in the country's poorest regions.
Earlier this week, the Labour and Social Affairs Ministry announced a redistribution of financing for state-subsidised social programmes, shifting funds to private sector projects.
The decision provoked strong opposition in some municipalities with high unemployment rates.

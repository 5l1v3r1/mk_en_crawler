BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Scheduled to assume the EU's rotating presidency on January 1st, Slovenia reportedly has drafted a plan for Kosovo's independence and Europe's reaction to it. 
According to media reports Wednesday (December 12th), the blueprint calls for Kosovo to declare itself an independent state in the first two months of 2008, probably in late February, which will be recognised by Britain, France, Italy and Germany within 48 hours. 
In a carefully orchestrated arrangement, the United States will announce its formal recognition of Kosovo shortly afterwards to be followed immediately by Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and then by a group of countries -- including Turkey, Macedonia, Albania Montenegro, Croatia and Slovenia. 
Members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference are also expected to recognise the new state without delay. 
Slovenia would like the EU foreign ministers to issue a statement immediately after Kosovo's declaration of independence to open the way for deployment of an EU administrative, judicial and police mission. 
The Slovenian plan is yet approved by the EU members, some of whom are reluctant to see the secession of Kosovo.

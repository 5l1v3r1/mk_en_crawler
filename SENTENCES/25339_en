BELGRADE, Serbia -- Three former top managers of the Serbian Glass Factory have been arrested for suspected abuse of power and causing 1m euros worth of damage to the company, local media reported on Tuesday (November 24th).
Aleksandar Djukic, Mirjana Djordjevic and Jasmina Manic were detained late Monday in the eastern town of Paracin, where the company is based.
Investigators say they ordered payments for consulting services through foreign contractors from Cyprus from 2007 to earlier this year, though no services were ever provided.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The interior ministry will ask the US Justice Department for help in getting Facebook to divulge information about a group threatening President Boris Tadic, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Tuesday (April 27th). 
Dacic added that the security of senior officials has been raised to the highest level. 
Police and prosecutors have launched an investigation into the threats at the request of Tadic's Democratic Party. 
Spokeswoman Jelena Trivan says a group has posted the message "Tadic, the armoured Mercedes won't help you, as when you open the door a sniper awaits you" on the social network. 
All political parties -- ruling and opposition â have condemned the threats.
Separately Tuesday, Croatian media reported that former President Stipe Mesic has also received death threats via the internet. 
According to media reports, most members of the group "Death to Stipe Mesic" on Facebook are Kosovo Serbs. 
The group allegedly has 5,000 members.

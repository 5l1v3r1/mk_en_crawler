SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The members of the BiH presidency -- Ivo Miro Jovic, Borislav Paravac and Sulejman Tihic -- were due to arrive in Paris Monday (12 December) for a two-day visit marking the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords. 
They will attend several events organised to commemorate the peace deal, which was formally signed in the French capital on 14 December 1995. 
The tripartite BiH presidency is expected to meet with French President Jacques Chirac and other senior French officials.
In other news, the task force working to draft a state-level bill on higher education in BiH meets again on Monday, in an attempt to reach an agreement on the wording. 
The expert group failed to do so last week, despite Friday's informal deadline set by the BiH Council of Ministers.

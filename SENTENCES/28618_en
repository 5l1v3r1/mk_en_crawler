BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors on Thursday (August 12th) charged Croatian citizen Veljko Maric with 1991 crimes against civilians in the village of Rastovac, in Croatia's Grubisno Polje municipality. 
Maric, 59, was arrested on Wednesday in Dimitrovgrad -- on the border with Bulgaria -- based on an arrest warrant issued in April.
Meanwhile, Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal concluded at a session Thursday that co-operation is running smoothly.

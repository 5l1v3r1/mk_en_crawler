BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu notified President Traian Basescu on Thursday (June 7th) that he would not attend Friday's talks among the various parties in parliament, organised by Basescu. 
In his letter, Tariceanu questioned Basescu's motives and said Basescu's term in office has been chaotic. 
The president has suggested that Tariceanu and his cabinet step down in the wake of a failed bid to impeach him. 
Basescu's Democratic Party has already filed a no confidence motion against the cabinet, with parliamentary debate and a vote expected on Monday.

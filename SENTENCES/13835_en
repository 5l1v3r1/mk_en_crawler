BERLIN, Germany -- The conservative government of Germany's largest federal state, Bavaria, has ordered three suspected Islamic extremists -- two Bosnians and one Moroccan -- to leave the country by 10 September or face deportation. 
According to a statement from the Bavarian state interior ministry Thursday (18 August), the three -- identified as Izudin J., Fatmir J. 
and Youssef J. 
respectively -- have been missionaries for several years for an organisation, Jamaat al-Tablighi, suspected of supporting terrorism.

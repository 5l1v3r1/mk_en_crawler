BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Wednesday (November 28th) that while Serbia continues searching for Hague war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, their whereabouts remain unknown. 
In an interview with AP, Vukcevic said Serbian security forces recently found evidence that Karadzic was in Serbia "around 2004" and spent time in Russia before returning to Serbia, but no longer lives there. 
As for Mladic, Vukcevic said authorities believe he is hiding somewhere in Serbia and is being helped by nationalist hardliners.

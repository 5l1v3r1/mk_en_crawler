TIRANA, Albania -- By a vote of 74 to 1, parliament adopted the 2011 draft budget early Friday (November 26th) after 17 hours of heated debate. 
The votes came from the ruling majority, since the opposition boycotted the vote, saying the budget was unrealistic. 
During the debate, Prime Minister Sali Berisha had urged the opposition to support the largest budget draft law ever. 
It focuses on road infrastructure, education and health, as well as boosting salaries and pensions. 
Opposition lawmakers say the draft includes "euphoric" public investment and is unrealistic in terms of projected tax revenues and economic growth.

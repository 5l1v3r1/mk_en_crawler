SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament unanimously adopted a bill Thursday (March 18th) to ban Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) cultivation for scientific and commercial reasons. 
The vote came amid fierce public debate and protests. 
In mid-January, lawmakers gave a first reading approval to amendments proposed by the ruling GERB government to ease GMO restrictions, in line with EU legislation. 
GERB later dropped its support for the changes.

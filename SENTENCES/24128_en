SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko rejected calls Thursday (May 14th) from lawmakers in Republika Srpska to give up the Bonn powers he has which allow him to fire officials and impose or annul laws. 
Bosnian Serb lawmakers adopted a document urging Inzko to relinquish this "undemocratic and outdated method of governing BiH". 
Under the Dayton Accord, the high representative has the power to fire officials seen as a threat to peace and stability. 
His spokesman, Mario Brkic, commented that Inzko will fully accomplish his mandate.

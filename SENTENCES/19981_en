BELGRADE, Serbia -- The presidential candidates wrapped up their campaigns on Thursday (January 17th) ahead of Sunday's crucial election.
Incumbent Boris Tadic told a crowd of about 20,000 supporters in Belgrade that they have a choice between a future in the EU and a return to the Milosevic era.
Tadic also promised to continue efforts to keep Kosovo a Serbian province.
His main contender, Tomisalv Nikolic of the extreme nationalist Radical Party, ended his campaign with a visit to Kosovo's Serb-populated areas.
He has made the issue of the province's future the centerpiece of his campaign, vowing tough measures against countries that recognise the province as an independent state.
Neither of the frontrunners is expected to get the more than 50% required for election in the first round of voting.
Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik was in Belgrade on Thursday campaigning for Tadic and suggested RS could prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from recognising Kosovo if the province unilaterally declares independence.

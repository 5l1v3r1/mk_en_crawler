SKOPJE, Macedonia -- During a visit to Skopje on Wednesday (14 September), British Minister for Europe Douglas Alexander said it is the implementation of set reforms -- rather than Macedonia's constitutional name -- that will play the decisive role in prospects for EU membership. 
Alexander, whose country currently presides over the EU, confirmed that Britain supports Macedonia's efforts to join Euro-Atlantic structures, stressing that if the country continues with economic and political reforms, it will eventually become part of the Union. 
He added that the bilateral dispute with Greece regarding Macedonia's name poses no obstacle to Skopje's EU integration process.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's convoy was attacked in the northern city of Kastamonu late Wednesday (May 4th), leaving one police officer dead and another injured.
Erdogan himself was not in the convoy, but some of his closest aides were.
The attackers, who managed to escape after opening fire on police, threw explosives at the bus carrying party activists to a meeting ahead of the June 12th elections.
Erdogan had left Kastamonu in a helicopter shortly before the incident to head for another rally in Amasya.
In a speech to supporters of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) there, he expressed sorrow over the attack, blaming it on separatist groups.
Separately Wednesday, six police officers were injured in an attack during the funeral of four members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Diyarbakir.
Those attending the funeral attacked the city prison, trying to access the prison compound.

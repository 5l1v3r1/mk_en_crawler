BUCHAREST, Romania -- Businessman Dinu Patriciu has won a wiretapping case against the Romanian Intelligence Service. 
The High Court of Justice ruled on Friday (February 18th) in favour of Patriciu, saying the service had violated his right to privacy by tapping his phone conversations without a court order. 
The intelligence service must pay him about 12,000 euros in damages.

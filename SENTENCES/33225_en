SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government adopted the draft national concept on security and defence on Monday (12 May). 
The document outlines the risks stemming from Macedonia's geographic position and suggests military and economic measures to improve the security and defence environment, including the establishment of a crisis management centre. 
The concept, which would involve several legislative changes, now moves to parliament for approval.
In other news, the government announced that a regional conference on border security would take place next week in Ohrid. 
Regional leaders are expected, as is NATO Secretary General George Robertson. 
The announcement came as Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, expressed strong concerns about the security situation in Macedonia. 
The quote appeared Monday in the Austrian daily <I>Der Standard</I>.

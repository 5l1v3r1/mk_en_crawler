LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Bulgaria officially took over chairmanship of the Central European Free Trade Association from Slovenia at a ceremony Tuesday (3 February).
In Sofia meanwhile, Bulgaria's Socialist Party (BSP) moved for parliament to conduct a no-confidence vote against the cabinet. 
The party is hoping to force early elections, which polls suggest, would result in a BSP victory.

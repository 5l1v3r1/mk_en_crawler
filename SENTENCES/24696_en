MITROVICA, Kosovo -- EULEX police had to use tear gas again Monday (May 4th) to disperse about 100 Serbs protesting the rebuilding of five Albanian houses in northern Mitrovica.
One person was injured in the clash.
EULEX spokesperson Christophe Lamfalussy confirmed that tear gas was used after protesters passed the cordon of local police in an attempt to enter the so-called "yellow zone" dividing Mitrovica's Serb-dominated north from the Albanian-dominated south.
Serbs insist that Albanians can rebuild their homes only if Serbs are allowed to return to their homes in the south and other parts of Kosovo.
Also Monday, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci invited all displaced citizens to return to their properties, promising them help from Kosovo's institutions.
"The government of Kosovo will create even better conditions for all citizens who return to their homes and properties.
Once again, we call on Serb citizens who live in Serbia to return to their places and homes," Thaci told a joint press conference with Minister for Communities and Return Sasa Rasic.

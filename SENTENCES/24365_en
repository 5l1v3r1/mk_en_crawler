LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Police on Friday (July 10th) arrested a Croat national armed with hand grenades who allegedly plotted to assassinate Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor, media reported. 
The 65-year-old man, a former war veteran, was caught on a train at the Slovenian-Croatian border, Police Commissioner Janko Gorsek said. 
Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said Zagreb "strongly condemns any extremism and violent threats", and offered her government's help in the investigation.
In other news Saturday, former Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel voiced concern over Slovenia-Croatia relations, and warned they may prompt "incidents". 
"I am worried about the relations between common people on both sides," he said in an interview with the weekly Demokratija, warning the spiral of misunderstanding must end. 
Last year, Ljubljana blocked Zagreb's EU accession talks over a border dispute in the Bay of Piran.

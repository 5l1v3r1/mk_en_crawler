NEW YORK, United States/ANKARA, Turkey -- The UN Security Council on Wednesday (August 4th) welcomed the establishment of a UN panel to probe the Israeli raid against a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead on May 31st. 
The panel will be chaired by former New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer. 
Vice-chairman will be outgoing President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe. 
The remaining two members of the panel will be a Turk and an Israeli. 
The commission is set to start work next week and deliver its first report in mid-September.
Meanwhile, a senior Turkish official said on Tuesday that the foreign ministry has summoned Israel's ambassador to Ankara, Gabby Levy, to protest recent comments by Israel's Defence Minister Ehud Barak about Turkey's ties with Iran. 
Barak's comments referred to new intelligence chief Hakan FIdan, whom he called a "supporter of Iran".

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has turned down a request for the temporary release of former Macedonian security official Johan Tarculovski, who asked to visit his family, media reported on Thursday (July 23rd).
Along with his request, Tarculovski submitted guarantees from the Macedonian government that he will stay in touch with Hague authorities.
The court, however, decided there is no urgent need for his release.
Tarculovski was sentenced last year to 12 years in prison for war crimes committed against ethnic Albanians during an August 2001 raid on the village of Ljuboten.
His co-defendant, former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski, was acquitted.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The trial against six people suspected of helping war crimes indictee Stojan Zupljanin evade justice starts on Monday (April 11th) in Belgrade.
According to the prosecution, the six sheltered Zupljanin between May 2002 and June 2008.
While on the run, the wartime Bosnian Serb Security Service Centre chief allegedly hid at 26 locations in Serbia under a false identity.
Zupljanin was arrested in 2008 and charged by the UN tribunal with war crimes against Muslim and Croats in the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities are investigating a number of companies whose employees may be financing war crime fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, an interior ministry official quoted by Reuters said on Thursday (November 13th). 
Inspections are under way at a number of private enterprises to cut funding for the two fugitives. 
So far, around a dozen companies have undergone inspections, the unidentified official added.
Armed gendarmerie officers raided a plant in the town of Valjevo on Monday in searching for Mladic. 
War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told the daily Vecernje Novosti on Thursday "This is only the beginning." The head of Serbia's national council for ties with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, told Politika on Thursday such operations will continue in coming days and weeks, though authorities are not certain the fugitives are in Serbia.

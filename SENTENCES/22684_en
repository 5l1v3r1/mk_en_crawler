BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday (July 10th) to boost bilateral political and economic relations during Erdogan's daylong visit to Baghdad, the first by a Turkish prime minister in 18 years.
During a news conference after their meeting, Erdogan urged the region to intensify efforts to support the Iraqi government in rebuilding the country after years of war.
He said both countries want to establish a "security area" to cope with terrorist threats in the region.
The Iraqi government pledged its support for Turkey's fight against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which uses bases in northern Iraq to plan attacks in Turkey.
The two prime ministers also announced the establishment of a Turkish-Iraqi council for strategic co-operation, including the ministers for security, energy, trade, investment and water resources.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is expected to impose financial sanctions on Bulgaria for failing to curb corruption and to warn Sofia that it might lose more EU funds if the problem persists, Reuters reported on Wednesday (July 16th).
While observers expect the EC to criticise both Romania and Bulgaria for corruption in its annual country reports that will be released July 23rd, only Bulgaria faces the risk of losing 500m euros that the EC has frozen.

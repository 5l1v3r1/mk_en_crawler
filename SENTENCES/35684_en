BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase has sent a letter to his Ukrainian counterpart, Victor Yanukovich, calling on Ukraine to abandon plans to build a canal in the Danube delta.
In a statement released Thursday (3 June), the government said Romania and independent environmental experts are concerned that construction of the canal, which began last month without any preliminary talks with Romania, would negatively impact the regional ecosystem.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov is conditioning his support for draft changes in the election law -- currently under discussion by parliament -- on lowering the participation deposit that the ruling NMS-II wants to introduce before this summer's parliamentary elections.
Parvanov has hinted he might veto the new legislation because of several clauses, one of which would introduce a 20,000-euro participation deposit for parties.
Parvanov says it would be discriminatory and in violation of the constitution.
Junior government partners Movement for Rights and Freedoms and New Time have also objected to the provision.

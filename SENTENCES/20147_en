SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An Algerian-born former fighter suspected of links to terrorism was deported from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) last week.
Speaking on Friday (December 14th), Deputy Security Minister Dragan Mektic confirmed the move, which was reported by local media.
The ex-militant, Atau Mimun, is one of many foreign-born Muslim fighters who volunteered to fight alongside Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 war but stayed in BiH after marrying locally.

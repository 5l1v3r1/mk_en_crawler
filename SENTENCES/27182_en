PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador Christopher Dell said on Wednesday (March 3rd) that establishing the new municipality of North Mitrovica will strengthen the rule of law in the Serb-dominated region of Kosovo.
"The creation of the new municipality ...
is a part of the solution to put an end to the heavy abuses of power, systematic corruption and to guarantee that people there are going to be heard by their governance," Dell said.
He made the remarks at a ceremony in Pristina at which he awarded grants to six municipalities.
The money will help those local governments continue reforms, especially in the field of management and services.

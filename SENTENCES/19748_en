BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government decided on Wednesday (August 22nd) to hold European Parliament (EP) elections on November 25th. 
Romania will get 35 seats in the EP, but those seats must be filled by the end of the year. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu consulted with leaders of the parties in parliament on Monday. 
The elections were originally scheduled for May, but were postponed in light of political upheaval, including an attempt to impeach President Traian Basescu.

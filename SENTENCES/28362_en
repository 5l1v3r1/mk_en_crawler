ANKARA, Turkey -- A military court pressed charges Tuesday (July 13th) against Colonel Dursun Cicek, who is suspected of plotting a coup.
Cicek is accused of forging documents aimed at discrediting top army commanders.
He is also suspected of involvement in creating a document called "The Action for the Fight and Fundamentalism" that aimed to topple the government.
Prosecutors say his motive was revenge, after being overlooked for a promotion.
The indictment demands that Cicek be removed from the ranks of the Turkish army.
He is currently on trial in a civilian court for membership in "an illegal organisation" and "attempting to destroy the government of the Turkish Republic through violence and force, or attempting to prevent it from its duty".
His co-defendants include General Saldirai Berk, commander of the Third Army in Erzincan, and the city's chief prosecutor, Ilhan Cihaner.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) decided on Tuesday (May 4th) to retire Archbishop Artemije, thus removing him from his post as the SPC's leader in Kosovo.
Artemije was suspended from duty in February, amid suspicions he embezzled millions of euros in aid and government money over several years.

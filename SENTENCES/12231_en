NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is considering future steps to assist in resolving the Cyprus issue, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday (10 June).
Dujarric said Annan was briefed on the positions and concerns expressed by all sides during envoy Kieran Prendergast's recent trip to the region.
On Friday, Greek Cypriots criticised Annan's plans to recommend the easing of restrictions imposed on the Turkish Cypriot part of the island.
Nicosia also suggested that it would reject a new proposal by Ankara for direct trade with the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

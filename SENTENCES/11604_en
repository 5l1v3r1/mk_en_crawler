STRASBOURG, France -- The next EU enlargement wave is "not around the corner", EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the European Parliament on Tuesday (21 June). 
He warned that he would not hesitate to recommend a delay in the accession of Bulgaria and Romania if the two countries fail to meet all requirements. 
Turkey, he added, would have to maintain the pace of reforms and must "tackle the truth" about the killings of Armenians during World War I. 
Rehn also said that other Balkan nations should be given the promise of a future in the EU, urging the Union to prepare for the opening of negotiations with Albania, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro.
In his remarks, Rehn called for a new expansion scenario, saying that Plan A, which counted on ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, had failed and there had never been a Plan B. 
He said Brussels should now develop a Plan C based on three key principles -- consolidation, conditionality and communication.

ATHENS, Greece -- Garbage workers in Athens broke into City Hall on Monday (March 17th) as part of a protest against the government's pension system reforms. 
Police did not interfere, citing the "democratic character" of the action. 
Mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis said his employees could not work under the circumstances and asked them to leave until the protest ends. 
Kaklamanis remained in the building. 
The workers have been on strike for more than a week, refusing to collect garbage from Athens' streets until their demands are met. 
As a result, tonnes of waste have piled up.
Workers in the underground, railway, energy, banking, and law sectors in Athens are joining the protest Tuesday with a 24-hour strike against proposed pension reforms.

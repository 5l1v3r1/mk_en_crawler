BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu called a meeting Wednesday (26 November) of the heads of state institutions dealing with intelligence, defence and public order.
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss security-related issues.
Presidential spokesperson Corina Cretu said the participants concluded there is no special reason for public concern, but that preventive measures were sensible -- especially in light of recent terrorist attacks in Istanbul.
Iliescu called for better co-operation and co-ordination among the domestic institutions as well as with foreign partners.

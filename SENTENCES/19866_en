SOFIA, Bulgaria -- By a comfortable margin, the government survived a no-confidence vote Tuesday (October 23rd) -- its third since coming to power.
Several opposition parties had called for the vote because of the ongoing education crisis.
Most of Bulgaria's teachers have been on strike for weeks, demanding huge wage increases and more funding for schools.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev told lawmakers such spending would accelerate inflation and threaten macro-economic stability.
He acknowledged, however, that teachers are underpaid and pledged to address the matter.

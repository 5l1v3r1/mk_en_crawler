VIENNA, Austria -- Representatives of 15 countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence formed an International Steering Group for Kosovo (ISG) on Thursday (Friday 28th) in Vienna.
The group elected Dutch diplomat Peter Feith as its international civilian representative in Kosovo, overseeing implementation of former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence.
In an interview with the BBC, he said the international community must try to explain the benefits offered by Ahtisaari's plan to the different communities living in Kosovo.
He added that he would oppose attempts by Belgrade to partition Kosovo or create parallel institutions.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica says the establishment of the ISG for Kosovo represents a violation of UN resolution 1244, international law and Serbia's Constitution.

ROME, Italy -- Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha confirmed on Thursday (February 11th) his government's intention to transform the country into a "regional electricity superpower". 
"We are determined to use all sources in the near future that will make Albania the biggest exporter of energy in the region," Berisha said in a speech at an investment forum in Verona, Italy.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler and Greek Development Minister Demetris Sioufas sealed an electricity exchange and energy co-operation pact on Thursday (July 19th).
As a first step, Turkey will supply 137 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to Greece beginning later this month, to help handle rising power consumption in the summer months.
Guler stressed that while the deal extends through August, it could be reactivated whenever Greece is short of electricity.
Another major energy project discussed was the Turkey-Greece natural gas pipeline, which would be part of the southern energy corridor in Europe.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Talks between Kosovo and Serbia on the so-called technical issues will continue after a motion to suspend the talks failed in parliament Thursday (May 5th).
Presented by the opposition Vetevendosje Movement, the initiative was rejected by a vote of 56 to 21.
Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti said that the talks will secure Serbia EU candidate status and will reinforce its influence in Kosovo, whereas Kosovo is expected to get nothing but copies of its cadastral documents stolen by Serbia in 1999.
Opposition lawmakers criticised the government for lacking a platform on the talks, but Prime Minister Hashim Thaci disagrees, saying there is a platform, based on the Resolution for Talks that parliament adopted.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Wednesday (February 24th) appointed Ylber Hysa as oversee implementation of the strategy for northern Kosovo.
His task will be to co-ordinate government activities and to co-operate with all relevant international institutions in order to implement the plan.
The strategy seeks to put the Serb-dominated north under the control of Kosovo institutions, rather than Belgrade-backed parallel structures.

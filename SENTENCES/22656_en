SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (October 10th) that 2009 will be the "year of the Western Balkans" and a crucial year for the EU enlargement process.
Speaking at the Crans Montana forum in Sarajevo, attended by more than 400 officials from the region and around the world, Rehn said the EU could drop visa requirements for citizens of the Western Balkans next year.
Regarding Croatia, Rehn said accession talks are "proceeding well", and that for Montenegro, adaptation to EU standards is "proceeding normally".
As for Serbia, Rehn said the country may receive EU candidate status by 2009.
Rehn praised Turkey for its constructive role in resolving the Caucasus crisis and its diplomatic activities concerning Syria, Armenia and the Middle East.
However, he criticised the slow pace of domestic reforms in Turkey.
Rehn said the main challenge in Albania remains "the rule of law".
As for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rehn said the country must work harder to reform its constitution and should conduct a population census to boost its EU accession prospects.
He described Kosovo as among the EU's "priorities".

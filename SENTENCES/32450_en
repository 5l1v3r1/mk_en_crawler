BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the Italian daily <I>Repubblica</I> Tuesday (18 March) that late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic had warned he might be gunned down.
She says that during a meeting on 17 February in Belgrade, Djindjic said his plans to reform the security services might provoke his assassination.
His successor, Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, says the murder was politically motivated, extending beyond organised crime.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom on Thursday (February 10th) urged EU members opposed to Romania's Schengen accession to explain in detail their expectations so Bucharest can get a green light to join the border-free zone. 
Romania is technically ready to make the important step, Malmstrom said during a visit to Bucharest. 
She cited the recent anti-corruption sweep, which led to the sacking of Customs chief Traian Marginean, as an indication of Romania's commitment. 
Malmstrom meets with Bulgarian officials in Sofia on Friday.

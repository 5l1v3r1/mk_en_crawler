BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Monday (February 18th) that Romania's diplomats will be withdrawn from Kosovo. 
"We have a diplomatic service in Kosovo that is part of the Romanian Embassy in Belgrade. 
With our refusal to recognise the independence of the Kosovo province, this service is terminated," Basescu said. 
At an extraordinary session Monday, Romania's parliament overwhelmingly approved the government's decision not to recognise Kosovo's independence.

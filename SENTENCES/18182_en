BUCHAREST, Romania -- A group of ten Parliament members from the ruling National Liberal Party and the opposition Social Democratic Party, Conservative Party and Greater Romania Party submitted a bill to the Senate on Thursday (March 15th) to change the referendum law. 
This measure, the fourth of its kind in two years, would restrict the president's right to call for a referendum and to decide its date. 
It would also streamline the procedure to suspend the president, requiring only a simple majority of eligible voters. 
A month ago the opposition launched a referendum to impeach President Traian Basescu for alleged abuse of power.

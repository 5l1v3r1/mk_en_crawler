BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)-- The government of Republika Srpska has authorised the entity's defence ministry to destroy its stockpile of 4,000 antiaircraft missiles, a spokesman announced Friday (30 January).
The move came after US Ambassador Clifford Bond warned in December that these shoulder-fired weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.
SFOR will assist in destroying the missiles.
Also on Friday, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska adopted a bill for amendments to the law on special taxes.
The new regulations replace the former "republican tax" with a new system of road fees charged on fuel sales.

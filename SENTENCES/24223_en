ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested a lieutenant colonel on Tuesday (January 13th) in connection with an alleged planned coup in the so-called Ergenekon case. 
Police say they found a cache of guns, semi-automatic rifles and hand grenades in his house. 
The day before, police found a similar weapon cache buried in the yard of a deserted house in Ankara's suburbs. 
The Ergenekon case gained wide publicity last summer when police announced the arrest of 86 suspected members. 
They arrested another 40 people recently, including senior military officers, politicians, journalists, scientists and lawyers. 
Authorities believe Ergenekon has been trying to topple the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan because of its Islamic course, which, according to Ergenekon, runs counter to the principles of the founder of the republic, Ataturk. 
Critics, however, view the mass arrests among the Turkish elite as political persecution.

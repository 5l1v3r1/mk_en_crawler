BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A significant information flow from Republika Srspka (RS) institutions to the Srebrenica Commission has been reported since High Representative Paddy Ashdown warned of sanctions against RS for obstructing the investigation into the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
The commission's new chairman, Milan Bogdanovic, and Deputy Chairman Smail Sekic said Tuesday (27 April) that a lot of information has been submitted over the past few days and that co-operation with the RS Defence and Interior Ministries is satisfactory.
Citing obstruction earlier this month, Ashdown fired the chiefs of the RS Army's general staff and the RS government secretariat for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
He also set a 30 April deadline for the defence and interior ministers to provide all relevant information about the massacre.

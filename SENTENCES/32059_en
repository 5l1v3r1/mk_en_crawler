BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Interior Minister Zoran Zhivkovic asserted Tuesday (19 November) that visiting US weapons experts are helping the government find new markets for military production, and are not investigating any illegal arms trade with Iraq. 
That probe, he said, is being conducted solely by Yugoslav authorities. 
According to the Associated Press, meanwhile, there are concerns that Baghdad has been studying low-tech countermeasures used by Yugoslavia to foil US air strikes against its military in 1999. 
NATO prevailed by destroying infrastructure and government buildings in Yugoslavia, but did comparatively little damage to the Yugoslav military in Kosovo.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Elections Commission (CEC) says it will respect a decision to organise and hold snap elections but will be unable to guarantee the quality of the process.
CEC President Valdete Daka said on Sunday (October 17th) that the institutions are preparing for February 13th elections, as determined by Acting President Jakup Krasniqi.
But should parliament be dissolved and the country forced to organise snap elections within 45 days, Daka says "there will be no 100% guarantee that there will be quality".
The government has eight days, starting Monday, to re-establish the cabinet after the junior partner Democratic League of Kosovo withdrew from the coalition at the weekend.
If the Democratic Party fails to do so, the constitution requires snap elections within 45 days.

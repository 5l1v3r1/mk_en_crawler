PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo faces no external security threats, KFOR Commander General Markus Bentler said in an interview with radio Blue Sky on Friday (December 25th). 
"I'm very convinced and we have emphasised this on many occasions that the real risk doesn't come from outside," he said when asked about a new military base Serbia has opened near the Kosovo border.
If any risk still exists within Kosovo, it is because of economic woes and tensions among different ethnic groups, Bentler said. 
Security, he stressed, is in the hands of the Kosovo Police, EULEX and KFOR.

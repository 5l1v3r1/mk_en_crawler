THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN's highest court ruled on Monday (February 26th) that while Serbia failed to use its clear influence with Bosnian Serbs to prevent the genocide of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica, Serbia was not directly responsible for genocide or complicity in genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
In a lengthy ruling, the International Court of Justice said the leaders of Serbia "should have made the best effort within their power to try and prevent the tragic events then taking shape" in the UN enclave, the scale of which "might have been surmised". 
Sarajevo has accused Belgrade of pursuing a policy of genocide on its territory. 
Serbia denied responsibility, claiming that no plan ever existed for extermination of Bosniaks. 
This marked the first case in which an entire state was accused of genocide.

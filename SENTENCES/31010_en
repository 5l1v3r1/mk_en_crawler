SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Gjorge Ivanov on Thursday (March 31st) hailed the readiness of all political parties to run in the upcoming early elections.
He voiced expectation that the vote will be fair and democratic as it is important for the EU integration process of the country.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski announced on Wednesday that his senior ruling VMRO-DPMNE party will propose June 5th as a date for the snap vote.
The decision came as Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM, said earlier that he was dropping all demands and will participate in the elections.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) is urging the Albanian government and the opposition to end their stalemate and begin necessary reforms. 
In a resolution adopted on Thursday (January 28th), PACE advised the government to form a parliamentary commission to investigate the June 2009 general election, as the opposition has demanded, and urged the opposition to end its boycott of parliament. 
It suggested that President Bamir Topi serve as mediator.

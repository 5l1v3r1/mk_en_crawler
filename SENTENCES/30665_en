WASHINGTON, United States -- Career diplomat Richard Holbrooke, best known for brokering the peace agreement between Bosnian factions in 1995 that became the Dayton Peace Accords, remains in critical condition Monday (December 13th) following hours of grueling surgery to repair a tear in his aorta.
Holbrooke, 69, fell ill during a meeting Friday at the state department with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Holbrooke is currently US President Barack Obama's special representative to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

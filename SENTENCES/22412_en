TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Bujar Nishani announced on Monday (July 14th) that Albanians will receive new electronic ID cards and biometric passports by February.
"We are ready to start issuing these important documents early next year, and they will be needed by any citizen who wants to obtain an official document from state institutions," Nishani said during a meeting of the parliament's integration committee.
Provision of electronic IDs and of biometric passports is among the tasks Albania must fulfil to meet the European Commission's definition of democratic elections and the free movement of people outside the country.

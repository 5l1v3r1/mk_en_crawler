SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik is inviting all parliamentary parties to constitutional reform talks in Banja Luka on Friday (October 30th). 
He says he will not invite foreign representatives because domestic efforts could produce a more viable solution.
Most political leaders have declined the call, saying a new negotiating process is not needed while there are ongoing talks under the EU-US auspices. 
Dodik's initiative comes after the leaders of the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties rejected an EU-US proposed reforms package to accelerate BiH's EU and NATO integration, though they agreed to continue talks on an expert level.

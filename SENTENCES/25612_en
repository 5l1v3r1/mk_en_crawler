ATHENS, Greece -- The trial of a police officer charged with killing a 15-year-old boy in December 2008 resumed on Friday (January 22nd) amid strong security in Amfissa.
The proceedings opened on Wednesday but were postponed for two days because a key defence lawyer could not attend.
The trial is being held in the small mountain town, about 200km west of Athens, due to "security concerns".
Police officer Epaminondas Korkoneas, 38, is charged with killing Alexis Grigoropoulos, whose death spurred a wave of protests and violence throughout the country.
A second police officer, Vassilios Saraliotis, 32, is charged with being an accomplice.
The victim's mother is expected to be among the first to testify.

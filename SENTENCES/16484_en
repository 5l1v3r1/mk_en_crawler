SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb police officer Dragan Zelenovic, charged with war crimes by the UN tribunal, was extradited from BiH to The Hague on Saturday (10 June). 
Earlier in the week, Zelenovic was extradited from Russia, where he had been hiding for nine years under a false identity. 
He has been indicted in connection with the rape and torture of Muslim women at a prison camp in Foca during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. 
Three of Zelenovic's co-defendants have been sentenced to between 12 and 28 years in prison.
In other news, the UN tribunal announced on Friday that two convicts -- former Bosnian Croat political leader Dario Kordic and former Bosnian Serb reserve police officer Zoran Zigic -- were transferred to Austria to serve their respective 25-year prison terms. 
Kordic was sentenced in 2004 for instigating and ordering crimes against Bosnian Muslim civilians in several central BiH municipalities. 
Zigic was sentenced in 2005 for crimes committed against non-Serbs in Prijedor.

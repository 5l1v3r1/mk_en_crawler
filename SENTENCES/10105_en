In a surprise move, Turkey's government has announced that it intends to resume plans to build a nuclear power plant, most likely in the Mediterranean coastal region. 
The project had been undertaken by the previous government, but had to be scrapped just before the bidding stage following the economic crisis of early 2001.
"We will start holding talks with producer companies of these power plants in the near future," said Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler. 
He declined to give the date on which the tender would be held. 
Responding to environmental groups, Guler insisted the new plant would be safe.
A nuclear power plant has been on the agenda of successive governments for a number of years. 
But environmentalists have strongly opposed the idea, arguing that the high level of seismological activity in Turkey presents hazards. 
The projected site at Akkuyu, near the city of Mersin, is only 20km away from the Ecemis fault line, which is active.
A tremor of 8.0 magnitude on the Richter scale would seriously damage any kind of nuclear reactor in the area, geological engineers caution.
According to a report from the housing and public works ministry, 96 per cent of Turkey lies within "high risk" seismological zones, and 98 per cent of the population live in areas with a strong risk of quakes.
Meanwhile, the Electricity Production Corporation (EUAS) released a statement saying that the water reserves in the country's dams are very good and that the country does not currently face an energy problem.
All hydroelectric plants are working at full capacity, and Turkey has no need to import energy this year, said EUAS General Manager Onder Piyade.

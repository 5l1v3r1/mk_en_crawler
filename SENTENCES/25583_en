TIRANA, Albania -- Minority Greeks living in southern Albania established a new political party Tuesday (March 23rd) that will work to strengthen their rights. 
The Ethnic Greek Minority for the Future party, led by young intellectuals and businessman, is viewed as a continuation of the organisation for the protection of Greeks living in Albania known as Omonia.
Local media reported on Tuesday that some Omonia officials in the eastern town of Korca are linked to a visa scandal. 
Police say they allegedly participated in a shadowy affair in which visas were issued by the Greek Consulate in Korca for purposes of study. 
The consulate claims that attempts were then made to illegally supply people wanted by Interpol with such visas.

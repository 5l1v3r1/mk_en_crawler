ZAGREB, Croatia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj told a Croatian newspaper on Wednesday (12 January) that the province would meet the UN-established set of standards by mid-year, allowing talks on final status to begin. 
"For us those standards are not just the only way to open the doors for the solution of the Kosovo issue but also the only way for us ... 
to function as a European society," he said. 
Separately, Haradinaj denied that the UN war crimes tribunal had indicted him. 
He told Voice of America that his only contacts with the tribunal were talks held in Pristina early last month.

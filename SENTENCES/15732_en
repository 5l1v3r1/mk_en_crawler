ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Firefighters are struggling to tackle a huge blaze that has broken out in the cargo area of Istanbul's Ataturk International airport. 
Hundreds of people fled the area and nearby terminals Wednesday (24 May) and there are no confirmed reports of casualties. 
Huge plumes of black smoke rose from the airport, which was being doused from above by firefighting aircraft. 
It is not clear what caused the blaze at the building, near a hangar housing military aircraft. 
Occasional explosions were heard. 
There has been speculation in the Turkish media that chemicals or an electrical short circuit may have been to blame.

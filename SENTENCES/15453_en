SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors have decided to drop part of the initial indictment against former BiH presidency Croat member Dragan Covic, former Constitutional Court President Mato Tadic and other five officials.
The seven were charged last year with tax evasion and bribery in dealings with two brothers who own the Federation of BiH (FBiH)-based company Lijanovici.
Prosecutors said Friday (22 September) that they are dropping two counts of bribery, though charges of organised crime, abuse of office and embezzlement remain.
In light of the charges, the previous High Representative to BiH, Paddy Ashdown, removed Covic from his post in the tripartite presidency in March 2005.

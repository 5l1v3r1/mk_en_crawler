Many expected that the demolition of illegally constructed buildings on the Adriatic Riviera would be halted temporarily as foreign tourists arrive for the summer season.
However, Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta has decided to go ahead with the process, in spite of the influx.
Halting the demolitions, some analysts say, would undermine the campaign while encouraging those who invest in the illegal buildings as well as bureaucrats who share responsibility for the problem.
But others argue that tearing down buildings will create noise, dust and other nuisances, creating a negative impression of Croatia and thus undermining the tourist industry.
In fact, the sound of bulldozers and concrete mixers has been a feature of Croatian holidays for many years, because the tourism and construction seasons usually occur at the same time.
Building, much of it unauthorised, has burgeoned during the past several summers.
Only in Istria, which targets an exclusive clientele, is there peace and quiet.
Some tourists react with displeasure and choose to vacation elsewhere in the future.
However, many tolerate the noise and continue to return.
The Croatian Tourist Association says it is unable to do much beyond keeping track of the number of guests and the days they spend in Croatia.
They have no control over financial indicators.
Critics say the government's decision is not enough to stem the tide of illegal construction and prevent Croatia's beautiful coastline from being ruined.
Instead, they argue, government officials must take an active part in planning and preparing for the tourist season.

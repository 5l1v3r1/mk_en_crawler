SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU envoy Torbjorn Solstrom says the Union believes the Kosovo status issue must be resolved through a new UN Security Council resolution, based on Martti Ahtisaari's plan, which would replace Resolution 1244.
In an interview Sunday (April 29th) on the Macedonian TV channel Kanal 5, Solstrom said there is sufficient consensus within the EU about this.
Ahtisaari's proposal is the only option, he added.
According to Solstrom, it is possible for the EU, the United States and Russia to agree on the future UN resolution.
In other news Sunday, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht urged that any unilateral moves in the Kosovo status settlement process be prevented, especially the proclamation of Kosovo's independence without the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution.
De Gucht was speaking at a forum on trans-Atlantic relations, in Brussels.
He emphasised that a joint position by the international community would be crucial to the success of the status resolution process.

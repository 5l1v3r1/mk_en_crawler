BUCHAREST, Romania -- In a letter sent to the leaders of all parliamentary parties, Romanian President Traian Basescu insisted that elections for European Parliament (EP) be held as planned on May 13th. 
Earlier on Friday (March 2nd), Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu met with leaders of other parties, but failed to resolve differences over the timing of the EP elections, in light of two other pressing matters: referendums on Basescu's possible impeachment and on the introduction of a majority system to elect lawmakers.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country's largest trade union -- the Croatian Association of Independent Trade Unions (SSSH) -- protested on Friday (July 20th) plans to introduce an employee database that could be used by employers to gather additional information on their personnel. 
SSSH Chairwoman Ana Knezevic says the initiative would be unconstitutional, since such a database would expose personal data, including details on families and other private activities.

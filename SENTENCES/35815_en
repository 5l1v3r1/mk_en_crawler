BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece's high economic growth in 2003 was achieved independent of the upcoming Summer Olympic in Athens and related preparations, EU Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Pedro Solbes said Wednesday (28 January).
He was presenting the European Commission's recommendation for updates in Greece's Stability and Growth Programme for 2003-2006.
Solbes cautioned that additional public spending related to the Games would have a negative impact on the budget deficit.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders decided on Friday (December 15th) to put any further enlargement on hold until the Union has tackled its institutional problems.
Speaking at the end of a two-day EU summit, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the bloc needs to set its house in order, and that leaders need to convince their countries of the merits of enlargement.
The EU leaders also decided at the summit to suspend talks with Turkey on eight out of 35 negotiation chapters.
The move was made in protest over Turkey's refusal to end restrictions on trade with Cyprus.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair flew to Ankara immediately after the summit.
At a press conference with Turkish officials he highlighted the importance of Turkey's EU bid and voiced strong support for the country's efforts to join the Union.
He also suggested that London might launch direct flights to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's ruling Democratic Party (PDK) won in ten municipalities, according to preliminary results of round two of local elections held Sunday (December 13th).
The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) won in five municipalities, while the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo won in three.
The PDK and the LDK are head to head in a tight race in Prizren where about 1,000 votes are expected to decide the winner.
A Serbian party won in Strpce municipality, while an independent candidate was declared the winner in Hani i Elezit municipality, along the border with Macedonia.
A total of 21 of Kosovo's 36 municipalities had to hold second rounds because no candidates managed to secure more than 50% of the votes in the November 15th first round.
Kosovo Serbs plan to stage protests over alleged irregularities in that first round.
The Serbian Liberal Party (SLS), which won the vote in Gracanica municipality, offered cash and wood in exchange for votes, a group of Serb political party representatives claimed on Friday.
They also accused Thaci of backing the SLS candidate with financial support.

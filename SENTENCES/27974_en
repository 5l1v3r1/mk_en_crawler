SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Croatian web portal Necenzurirano (Uncensored) published a list Tuesday (May 18th) of alleged members of terrorist organisations in BiH. 
It contains names of more than 300 people, mainly Bosniaks. 
The portal describes it as among the most secret documents of the BiH Security Ministry and BiH intelligence agencies. 
According to Necenzurirano, Sarajevo has kept the document from international institutions to prove that the security situation is stable and to convince the EU to scrap visas for Bosnian citizens.

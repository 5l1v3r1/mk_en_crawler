BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Defence Council (CSAT) decided on Wednesday (November 22nd) that all energy privatisation contracts should be made public, in light of a number of cases of possible non-compliance with energy security policies. 
Economy and Trade Minister Codrut Seres will contact all holders of such contracts. 
Related documents will then be published on the ministry's website.
CSAT also decided to establish a special commission that would draft a new energy security strategy and submit it to the cabinet within six months. 
The document will propose ways to reduce foreign dependency and boost domestic energy-generating capacity.

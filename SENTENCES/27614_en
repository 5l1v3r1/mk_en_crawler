NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu on Monday (June 28th) to "grasp the current political window of opportunity to reach a settlement" in long-standing efforts to reunify the divided island.
This was Eroglu's first meeting with Ban since being elected leader of Turkish-dominated northern Cyprus in April.
According to a UN statement, Ban expressed hope that Eroglu and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias "would make serious advances in the coming months, understanding that this would require compromises on both sides".
Eroglu reiterated his commitment to finding a solution, possibly by the end of this year.

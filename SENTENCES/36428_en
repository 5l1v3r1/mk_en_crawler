SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A new national TV channel, BHTV 1, will become fully operational Friday (13 August), broadcasting the start of the Athens Olympics.
The Office of the High Representative welcomed the launch of the public television station, noting that it is the first time since the BiH conflict ended that a broadcaster will serve all citizens.
Establishment of a single, unified and self-sustaining public broadcasting system in BiH is a major requirement of the European Commission's Feasibility Study.

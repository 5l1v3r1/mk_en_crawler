BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu proposed a fiscal pact with social partners Wednesday (21 September) as a part of the cabinet's strategy to combat tax evasion. 
He explained that presently the ministry for public finances is preparing a set of measures that in part would sanction companies that fail to pay their fiscal obligations. 
He added that labour unions would be crucial to efforts aimed at eliminating the nearly 1 million illegal jobs in the grey economy that are not subject to taxation.
In other news, heavy rains flooded parts of Bucharest for a second straight day Wednesday. 
Water levels of up to 50cm were reported on some streets.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi on Monday (28 June) called on the province's telecommunications regulatory authority to reconsider its decision to allow a local company to set up a mobile phone network. 
Rexhepi urged UNMIK to use its authority to block the deal, citing allegations of corruption. 
The US office in Kosovo also objected to the ruling and called for an investigation.

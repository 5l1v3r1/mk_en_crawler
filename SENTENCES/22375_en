TIRANA, Albania -- Those living near Gerdec, where a series of army depot blasts killed 26 people, injured 300 and destroyed thousands of houses on March 15th, staged a protest on Monday (May 12th) and threatened to launch hunger strikes.
They claim the government failed to provide any help, forcing them to scrape by without running water and electricity.
Vowing to continue their protests Tuesday, they demanded a meeting with Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
Meanwhile, prosecutors have sent the records of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, who resigned over the Gerdec tragedy, to parliament.
A panel there investigating the case needs them in order to strip Mediu of his lawmaker's immunity.

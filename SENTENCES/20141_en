SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Council of Ministers (CoM) approved key police reform laws during a heated session Thursday (February 14th) at which the Serb and Croat ministers managed to outvote ministers from the major Bosniak parties, the Party for BiH and the Party for Democratic Action.
The draft laws on the Directorate for Co-ordination of Police Bodies and Agencies and the Independent and Supervisory Bodies of the Police Structure of BiH were then forwarded to the parliament for approval. 
CoM Chairman Nikola Spiric told reporters that the government respected what has been achieved by the police reform task force and said he hopes parliament would adopt the package quickly, as BiH's EU integration process is at stake. 
The country faced a February 15th deadline for drafting the package.

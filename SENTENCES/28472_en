BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former chief of the Republika Srpska (RS) police force Dragomir Andan was taken to hospital Wednesday (September 15th) after collapsing more than two weeks into a hunger strike.
After receiving medical help, he returned to an area outside the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Banja Luka to continue his protest.
Andan launched the hunger strike 16 days ago to protest High Representative Valentin Inzko's decision not to reconsider his case.
Andan was removed from duty in 2007 by then High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, for appearing to help war crimes fugitives.

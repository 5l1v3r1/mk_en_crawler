VIENNA, Austria -- State Prosecutor Helmut Jamnig said on Thursday (March 4th) that Austrian authorities are investigating former Croatian General Vladimir Zagorec for his alleged help in defrauding the troubled Austrian bank Hypo Group Alpe Adria. 
Last year, Croatia sentenced Zagorec to seven years in prison for embezzling nearly 4m euros in diamonds. 
He was also convicted of abuse of office. 
Austria extradited Zagorec to Croatia in October 2007. 
Now, Zagorec is under investigation in Vienna for abetting breach of trust in the Hypo case. 
According to media reports, he allegedly obtained illegal loans from the bank with the help of one of its bosses, also under investigation. 
Hypo, Austria's sixth biggest bank, nearly collapsed before it was nationalised last year.

BUERGENSTOCK, Switzerland -- The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey on Wednesday (24 March) joined Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in the final week of reunification talks. 
During their first meeting, Petros Molyviatis and Abdullah Gul "expressed their decisiveness" with regard to resolving the Cyprus dispute, a Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
A meeting between Greek Cypriot leader Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat was cancelled, however, because the Greek side was afraid that Talat did not have the authority to make decisions. 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has refused to travel to Buergenstock. 
Meanwhile, UN mediator Alvaro de Soto said that chances for an agreement are better than ever.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced the arrest Sunday (June 17th) of one of its most-wanted indictees, former Serbian police commander Vlastimir Djordjevic. 
He was detained in Budva, Montenegro, by local authorities, in co-operation with The Hague tribunal and Serbia, which is working hard to improve ties with the EU. 
Djordjevic, 58, stands accused of atrocities committed during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. 
He was one of the five remaining high-profile suspects wanted by The Hague tribunal. 
Previously, officials suspected he was hiding in Russia.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Ahead of the May 11th snap elections, the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) plans to form a coalition with the Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS) and United Serbia (JS). 
SPS leader Ivica Dacic told the Tanjug news agency on Wednesday (March 19th) that the aim of the SPS-PUPS-JS coalition would be to fight for national interests and to establish a country of social justice.
Late Tuesday, President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) decided to run on a joint list with G17 Plus, the Sandzak Democratic Party, the League of Vojvodina Social Democrats and the Serbian Renewal Movement. 
The list, which will be called "For a European Serbia -- Boris Tadic" will be created for the purpose of the parliamentary elections only. 
Local elections are being held the same day.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police are investigating two suspects accused of "breaching public order" in relation to an incident Sunday (May 30th) at the main bridge of the Ibar River in Mitrovica.
Although police prevented fighting between Albanians and Serbs on Election Day in the northern part of the divided town, two members of the Kosovo police were slightly injured during protests, and gunshots were heard.
The police station in Mitrovica described the overall response as accurate and effective.
KFOR troops were poised to intervene if necessary.

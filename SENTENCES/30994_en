ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested 35 suspected members of the illegal Islamist Turkish Hezbullah network on Monday (February 7th), 15 in and around Istanbul, and the rest in the cities of Batman, Diyarbakir and Sanliurfa.
Turkish Hezbullah is not connected with the Lebanese movement of the same name.
The group, responsible for bombing two synagogues in Istanbul in 2003, is believed to have largely disbanded.

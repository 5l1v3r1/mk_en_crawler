TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition is resuming anti-government street protests with a rally in the port city of Durres on Tuesday (December 14th). 
Spartak Ngjela, leader of the Law and Justice Party, which doesn't have a seat in parliament, said protests are the only way to oust the current government. 
"An illegal regime, with a government that does not govern with science but with people serving corruption and privileges can be ousted only through protests," said Ngjela. 
He also addressed residents of Shkodra, who have been promised compensation following weeks of floods, saying that government's promises are plain manipulation. 
The opposition continues to insist on transparency for the 2009 general elections, claiming they were manipulated by the ruling Democratic Party.

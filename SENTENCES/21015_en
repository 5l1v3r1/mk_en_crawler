BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission decided on Monday (December 3rd) to ease restrictions imposed on pork exports from nearly all of Cyprus. 
Bans were imposed after cases of foot-and-mouth disease were discovered at two farms in southern Cyprus this fall, forcing authorities to cull more than 1,500 animals. 
No new outbreaks have been reported, however.

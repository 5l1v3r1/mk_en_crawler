PODGORICA, Montenegro/BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have issued arrest warrants for three suspected members of an international drug trafficking ring, local media reported on Sunday (October 31st). 
Goran Sokovic, Drasko Vukovic and Dejan Sekularac are allegedly involved in the trafficking of more than two tonnes of cocaine that was seized last year during an international police operation dubbed "Balkan Warrior". 
Serbian media reported that the three are hiding in Berane, Montenegro and are members of alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric's group. 
Saric himself remains at large.
Meanwhile, 17 people were arrested both in Montenegro and Serbia after a new extradition agreement between the two countries came into force. 
Signed on Friday, it took effect immediately. 
About 12 people hiding in Montenegro are still wanted by Interpol Belgrade, while Interpol Podgorica has issued arrest warrants for 60 Serbian citizens.

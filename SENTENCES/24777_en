ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Wednesday (December 3rd) ordered the interior ministry to determine whether police abused their powers in several cases recently by arresting individuals who criticised the government on the Internet.
"No one in Croatia can be detained or arrested because of a different opinion or because of a protest against my or any other political view.
My main task as prime minister is to defend that right," Sanader said in a statement.
The measure came several days after police questioned the organisers of an 80,000-member Facebook group planning an anti-government rally in several cities, including Zagreb, on Friday.
Late last week, police questioned a young man for several hours about a Facebook group he launched called "I bet I can find 5,000 Facebookers who dislike Sanader." Police say they acted because of an image uploaded onto the site depicting Sanader in a Nazi uniform, despite a ban on Nazi symbols in Croatia.
Police apologised on Wednesday for that arrest.

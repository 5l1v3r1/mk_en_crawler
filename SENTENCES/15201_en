SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik insists that the entity is ready to arrest all those indicted by The Hague war crimes tribunal once it is aware of their whereabouts.
In an exclusive interview with Tanjug on Sunday (27 August), Dodik said that both RS and Serbia realise that as long as fugitives remain at large, neither would move ahead on the path to EU integration.
Dodik also accused the Federation of BiH of refusing to understand RS, adding this has led to the non-functioning of state-level institutions.
In a separate interview Saturday with the newspaper Dnevni Avaz, Dodik said that during his latest meeting with High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling, talks proceeded in friendly atmosphere but little progress was achieved, particularly around the stalemate on crucial police reform.

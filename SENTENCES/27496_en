NEW YORK, United States -- UN mediator Matthew Nimetz briefed Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday (April 29th), regarding talks he held Wednesday with Macedonia's Zoran Jolevski and Greece's Adamantios Vassilakis. 
While the EU has urged Athens and Skopje to resolve their name dispute by June, the UN will not insist on any timeframe for an agreement, UN spokesman Martin Nesirky told Deutsche Welle. 
He added the important thing is reaching an agreement that involves compromise and is acceptable to both sides.

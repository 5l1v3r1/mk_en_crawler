ATHENS, Greece -- Thousands of workers walked off their jobs on Thursday (March 11th), the third 24-hour general strike in a month.
The action, organised by the two biggest trade unions in protest of the government's austerity measures, is affecting government offices, public hospitals and schools, tax offices and trash removal.
Participation by air traffic controllers has brought incoming and outgoing flights to a halt.
Ferry service has stopped, as has public transportation in both Athens and Thessaloniki.
Journalists are striking as well, so there are no news broadcasts.
A rally in downtown Athens was attended by several thousand people marching to parliament.
Riot police ended up clashing with several dozen young men in hoods, who threw a firebomb and projectiles at police guarding a rally near the Athens Polytechnic University.

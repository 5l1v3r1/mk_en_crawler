ZAGREB, Croatia -- Visiting Zagreb on Friday (30 October), UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte expressed her great disappointment that fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina -- one of the tribunal's top three indictees -- has yet to face justice.
Following meetings with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and President Stipe Mesic, del Ponte said that although ties between Croatia and the tribunal improved in the past months, the one outstanding issue -- Gotovina's arrest and transfer to The Hague -- remains unresolved.
She declined to say how she will assess Croatia when she reports to the EU foreign ministers on Monday, noting that she still had two days to form her opinion.
Croatia's accession talks with the EU have been frozen for months because of Zagreb's failure to hand over Gotovina.

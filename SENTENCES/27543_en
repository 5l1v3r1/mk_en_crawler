ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu spoke by phone with his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki late on Friday (August 27th) seeking clarification about a recent statement by an Iranian official who described the 1915 killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as "genocide". 
"A hundred years ago, the Ottoman Empire committed genocide against a certain number of Armenians," Iranian Vice-President Hamid Baghaei was quoted by Iranian news agency IRNA as saying on Wednesday. 
Shortly after that, the Iranian Embassy in Ankara issued a statement explaining that Baghaei's words were wrongly reflected by some media. 
During their conversation Friday, Mottaki told Davutoglu that the conference where Baghaei made the statement was about World War II, not World War I, and reiterated that Tehran has not changed its position regarding the 1915 events. 
Davutoglu, however, insisted on an explanation from Baghaei himself.

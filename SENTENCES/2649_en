The Kosovo Unity Team, led by newly elected Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, agreed on Saturday (11 February) to participate in talks with Serbian representatives on 20 February in Vienna.
A seven-member delegation will be chosen this week for the negotiations.
On Saturday, the team approved a document setting forth Pristina's stance on decentralisation, one of the main topics to be discussed in the Austrian capital.
Opposition leader Hashim Thaci is confident that the Kosovo leaders are united in their views on Kosovo future.
"I am optimistic that this co-operation will help us to accelerate the process of determination of final status," he said.
Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi said there will no delays from the Kosovo side.
"The Kosovo delegation and other working groups have finished their preparations in time, and I believe that we will have prepared and finished all documents for Vienna," he said.
Kosumi travelled to New York on Saturday for the UN Security Council meeting, which will take place on Tuesday.
The visit marks the first time that a Kosovo leader has taken part in such a meeting.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen also travelled to New York for the meeting, where he will address the Council on the situation in Kosovo, the engagement of Kosovo's institutions and the fulfilment of standards over the last two months.

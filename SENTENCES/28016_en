ROME, Italy -- A court in Bari acquitted former Montenegrin Finance Minister Miroslav Ivanisevic of cigarette smuggling charges Monday (May 17th). 
Judge Rosa Calia Di Pinto concluded that there was no conclusive evidence against Ivanisevic. 
He has insisted he has nothing to do with a criminal group that traffics cigarettes from Montenegro to Italy.

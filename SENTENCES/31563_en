ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Wednesday (16 April) saying Cyprus' accession to the EU violates international legitimacy, as it means the Union accepts a country with an international conflict within its borders. 
In a speech coinciding with the signing of an accession treaty between the EU and the Greek part of Cyprus on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul noted that Cyprus would not officially become a member of the Union until 1 May 2004. 
He added that negotiations to resolve disputes on the island would continue throughout this year. 
Furthermore, Gul said Greek Cypriots could not prevent Turkey's EU membership.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The young anti-nationalistic group Our Party (Nasa Stranka) held its first congress in Sarajevo on Saturday (April 17th).
Members rejected ethnic divisions and vowed to work for BiH's EU accession.
Speaking to nearly 300 delegates, party leader Bojan Bajic said that they are launching a historic campaign for the general elections in October, a campaign that will end two decades of nationalistic politics.
Established in 2008, Nasa Stranka is unlike other any other party, as its members include representatives of all ethnic groups.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Damir Rovisan, a 28-year-old member of the British Embassy staff in Zagreb, brought an explosive device to work with him and detonated it Monday morning, Interior Minister Ivica Kirin said Tuesday (20 September). 
Rovisan was the only one who sustained injuries in the blast. 
He reportedly did it in hopes of receiving workers compensation. 
Kirin ruled out any link to terrorists.

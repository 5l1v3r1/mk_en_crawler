SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's eight largest political parties failed to reach a compromise on police reform during the latest round of negotiations, the Office of the High Representative said on Monday (September 24th).
Talks on the draft proposed by the High Representative Miroslav Lajcak are to continue in Banja Luka on Wednesday.
The mood after Monday's meeting was pessimistic.
Many of the participants noted that larger issues, such as the financing and organisation of police in regions, had not yet been approached.
Lajkak has set an end-of-September deadline for an agreement.

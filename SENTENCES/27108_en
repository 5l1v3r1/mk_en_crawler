ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor agreed on a framework plan on Friday (July 31st) to find a solution for their countries border dispute by year's end. 
Pahor told journalists that his meeting with Kosor sparked hope that a solution will be found in the coming months. 
Kosor said she is very satisfied because "we have opened a new page [and]... 
found a path to take". 
Slovenia blocked the EU accession negotiations of Croatia last year, claiming that part of the documentation submitted by Zagreb officials pre-judged the long-year border dispute between the two countries.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Municipalities in which the ethnic minority population accounts for more than 20 per cent of all citizens will be allowed to display two flags on official occasions, Justice Minister Ixhet Mehmeti said Thursday (25 November). 
Commenting on the draft law on state symbols, he added that such municipalities would use both the Macedonian national flag and the flag of their ethnic communities. 
The measure applies to areas with large Albanian minorities, as well as Turkish, Roma and Serbian minorities.

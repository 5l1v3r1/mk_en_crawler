PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX will not recognise the results of Serb elections in northern Kosovo, mission officials said on Sunday (May 23rd). 
Spokeswoman Kristiina Herodes added that EULEX recognises neither the elections in parallel structures nor their outcomes. 
Separately, UNMIK representatives said that the UN will maintain a neutral stance towards the Serb elections, expected in northern Mitrovica at the end of the month.
Serb party representatives continue to campaign on Kosovo territory, despite the fact they lacked permission to enter. 
Democratic Party of Serbia leader Vojislav Kostunica was in northern Mitrovica and Zvecan on Sunday.

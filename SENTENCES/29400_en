ATHENS, Greece -- The government adopted a draft measure Thursday (July 1st) on construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline that would allow the appropriation of land needed to build the facility.
Owners of the land would be compensated under the draft.
"This is a project of national importance and will benefit the society.
We continue our efforts to secure the construction," the Environment, Energy and Climate Change Ministry said.
The pipeline is expected to run from the Bulgarian town of Burgas on the Black Sea to Alexandroupolis in the northeast Aegean, bypassing the Bosporus Straits.
It is based on a trilateral agreement signed in March 2007.

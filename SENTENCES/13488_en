SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Administrative Court rejected on Monday (27 March) a request by Deputy Chief Prosecutor Mityo Markov to cancel a controversial concession contract for the Trakia (Thrace) motorway awarded last year.
According to the judges, the cabinet's January 2005 agreement with the concessionaire "Highway Thrace" violated no procurement laws.
Critics have questioned the transparency of the process, arguing that a public tender should have been held.

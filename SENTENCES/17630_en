SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The 13th Report of the Council of Europe (CoE) Monitoring Team on the Implementation of the Post-association Obligations of BiH will be constructive and beneficial to the development of BiH institutions, CoE Director General of Political Affairs Jean Louis Laurens said on Tuesday (March 27th). 
In Sarajevo, Laurens met with BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj, who assured him there is the political will to move past the present deadlock and proceed with implementing commitments BiH has made, such as constitutional reform and co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In other news Tuesday, the Federation of BiH (FBiH) House of Representatives Speaker Safet Softic said that FBiH might get a new entity government and a budget law by Saturday. 
High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling recently annulled the appointment of the entity government because it was done before the vetting of candidates was completed.

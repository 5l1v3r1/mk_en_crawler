MOSCOW, Russia -- Moscow could veto the blueprint for Kosovo's future status that was drafted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, a senior Russian diplomat indicated on Tuesday (April 24th). 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov said his country would not support a decision that is not acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
"The threat of using a veto must stimulate the sides to come up with mutually accepted compromises".
Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku immediately asked Moscow for clarification. 
Saying "no" to the Ahtisaari plan also amounts to a rejection of the opinion of the international community, he said.
In other news, a Spanish soldier serving with KFOR was killed and another was injured when their armoured vehicle overturned on Tuesday. 
They were on patrol in the Osojane Valley in northwestern Kosovo.

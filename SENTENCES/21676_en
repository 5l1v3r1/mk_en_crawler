ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Friday (October 24th) promised to eradicate organised crime, said the government would remain uncompromising in the face of the problem, and promised speedy adoption of anti-mafia legislation. 
His comments came after an extraordinary session of the Croatian Security Council, called after the murder of a leading figure in the country's media sector. 
Ivo Pukanic, owner of the daily Nacional, and the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franic, died in a car explosion Thursday.
The incident was roundly condemned at home and abroad. 
European Parliament rapporteur Hannes Swoboda said Croatia has taken three steps backward. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn condemned the murders and urged a thorough investigation. 
The OSCE also condemned the killings. 
Croatian President Stipe Mesic, meanwhile, said the attack bears the signs of terrorism. 
He acknowledged Croatia has suffered a setback, but insisted the country's EU bid is not at risk.
On Saturday, police released a composite sketch of the suspected bomber.

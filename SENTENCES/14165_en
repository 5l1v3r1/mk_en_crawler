ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish and WHO officials reported Saturday (14 January) the first three cases of people completely recovering from the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus. 
Doctors said they were encouraged by the fact that early detection and use of Tamiflu, the only available vaccine, appear to work well for patients with good immune systems. 
Twelve people remain hospitalised, but none of them is in serious condition.
In other news, Mehmet Ali Agca, the perpetrator of a 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II, failed to appear at the Istanbul police for a regular check-in after his release from prison earlier this week. 
Speaking Friday, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said an arrest warrant might be issued. 
Local media reports say there is no information about Agca's current whereabouts and that his lawyer's cell phone is off.

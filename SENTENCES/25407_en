TIRANA, Albania -- The so-called "anti-mafia" law that allows the seizing of assets whose legal origin cannot be proved took effect on Sunday (January 24th).
The new legislation enables authorities to seize suspicious assets and put the owners on trial to determine the source.
It was adopted last month without the support of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), whose lawmakers are concerned its application could be selective.
The opposition argues that the money brought home by immigrants is not registered, which represents an opportunity for authorities to abuse such cases.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Army General Vladimir Lazarevic will go to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague next week to face charges, the Serbian government announced on Friday (28 January). 
Lazarevic is one of four generals indicted 15 months ago in connection with war crimes in Kosovo in 1999. 
War crimes investigators have been pressuring Belgrade to hand over fugitive indictees. 
The government issued a statement saying the general had decided "to fulfil his duty towards his native land".

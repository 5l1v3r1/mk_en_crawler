PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia's Minister of Labour and Social Policy Rasim Ljajic said on Sunday (October 18th) that Serbs and other non-Albanians in Kosovo enclaves should behave as former Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova behaved towards Serbia, during Slobodan Milosevic's regime. 
"Albanians have never recognised the state of Serbia. 
Serbs should never recognise Kosovo, but they should use everything they can from the international community to strengthen their position," said Ljajic. 
According to him, this does not apply to Serbs in northern Kosovo, because "they are in a much better situation than Serbs from the enclaves".

NEW YORK, United States -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis says there is a new momentum towards resolving the Cyprus problem.
In comments after her meeting Monday (27 March) with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York, she said new efforts were arising out of talks on technical issues.
In other news, a team of university professors and telecom experts submitted a package of anti-tapping measures Monday to Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis.

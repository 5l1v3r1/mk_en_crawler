ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors have charged five people in connection with the murder last week of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. 
The suspects include the confessed triggerman Ogun Samast, 17. 
Four others have been charged with forming an organised group and with conspiracy to commit murder. 
One of the suspects, Yasin Hayal, reportedly has confessed to persuading Samast to kill Dink. 
Also Thursday (January 25th), a police bomb disposal squad blew up a suspicious package near the parliament building in Ankara. 
It contained a note signed by an ultranationalist terrorist group that threatened bombings if Samast and Hayal were not released.

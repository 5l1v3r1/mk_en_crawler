BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) agreed on Thursday (4 May) to recommend the launch of negotiations with Macedonia aimed at facilitating short-stay visas and readmission. 
Macedonia would be the first Western Balkan country to open negotiations on such agreements. 
EC Vice President Franco Frattini plans to submit the proposal at a ministerial conference under way in Vienna. 
The interior ministers of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro have joined their counterparts from EU member-countries at the security conference, focusing on fighting terror, organised crime and corruption, as well as asylum and immigration issues.

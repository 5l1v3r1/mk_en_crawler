BELGRADE, Serbia -- The arrest and extradition of the two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, will be a government priority in 2009, the head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Monday (December 29th).
He warned of major consequences for the country unless it extradites the two indictees to The Hague tribunal.
Solving that problem would both facilitate Serbia's European integration and stabilise domestic politics, Ljajic said.
"I cannot make any promises, set deadlines, or claim the arrests would happen, but I can rightfully speak of the harmful consequences in case Mladic and Hadzic stay at large," he noted.

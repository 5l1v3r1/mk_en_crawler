PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Atifete Jahjaga is downplaying the possibility of discussing any partition of Kosovo in ongoing talks with Serbia. 
Jahjaga was speaking at the Pristina airport Sunday (May 29th) as she returned from the Warsaw summit of central and east European countries where she met with European leaders and US President Barack Obama. 
Talks with Serbia were one of the main subjects discussed. 
"My stance was that this is a technical dialogue, aimed to ease the life of citizens of the Republic of Kosovo and Serbia, and any other issue that is open regarding the internal rearrangement or the status issue are issues that have a red line," Jahjaga said. 
She added that many states had promised to help Kosovo get more international recognitions.

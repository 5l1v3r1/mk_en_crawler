PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova told visiting Czech Prime Minister Jiri Paroubek that he would like former Czech President Vaclav Havel to mediate the upcoming talks on the future status of the province.
Paroubek is making a four-day trip to the Western Balkans to discuss a possible Czech role in the Kosovo process, among other issues.
In Belgrade, Serbia's government and parliamentary parties began talks Monday on the text of a draft resolution on Kosovo.
The document must be approved by parliament this week.
The cabinet was due Tuesday (15 November) to endorse principles of the negotiation platform and members of the negotiating team.

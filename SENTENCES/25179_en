STRASBOURG, France -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur for Croatia Hannes Swoboda said on Wednesday (November 25th) that Zagreb could wrap up its EU accession talks in mid-2010 and become a member in 2012. 
In an interview on the EP's website, he added that assessing Zagreb's co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal should not hinge on one element: handing over the so-called "artillery diaries" related to 1995's Operation Storm. 
He urged Croatian authorities to do their best to find the documents or prove they do not exist. 
Among the most urgent tasks facing Croatia, Swoboda cited corruption, public administration reform, reorganisation of courts and privatisation of shipyards.

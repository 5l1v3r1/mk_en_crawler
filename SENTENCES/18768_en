PLOVDIV, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov said on Monday (January 8th) that Bulgaria is ready to send a new contingent to Iraq but is awaiting an official invitation from the United States, which leads the multinational coalition there.
Sofia currently maintains a 154-strong, non-combat unit in Iraq, whose mission is set to expire in March.
Separately, Bulgaria announced on Monday that the Varna Military Naval Base would host a NATO exercise in July.
The drill would focus on crisis response.

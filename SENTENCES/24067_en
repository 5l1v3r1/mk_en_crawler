SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko urged Federation of BiH (FBiH) authorities to cut spending in order to ensure financial stability and to meet IMF requirements. 
During a meeting with FBiH leaders including President Borjana Kristo and Prime Minister Nedzad Brankovic on Tuesday (April 14th), Inzko stressed the need for fiscal consolidation. 
He warned that if FBiH does not take measures to reduce expenditures and tackle the economic crisis, there could be dangerous consequences. 
He also welcomed the proposal to establish a Fiscal Council at the FBiH level, similar to the one established at the state level, to bring together entity and cantonal representatives.

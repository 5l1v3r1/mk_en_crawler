PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Socialist People's Party (SNP) leader Srdjan Milic will propose to President Filip Vujanovic May 30th as a date for holding of local elections, media reported on Saturday (March 20th). 
The opposition will meet representatives of the parties that are not represented in the parliament on Monday to come up with the final suggestion. 
According to the media, the opposition wants to avoid May 23rd -- suggested by the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS)-led coalition -- fearing the fourth anniversary of the country's independence may be used by the ruling party to gain advantage ahead of the vote.

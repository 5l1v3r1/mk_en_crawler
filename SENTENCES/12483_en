BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court is expected to review three appeals Wednesday (6 July) of the government's draft laws on property and judicial reforms, submitted separately by two opposition parties -- the Social Democratic Party and the Greater Romania Party -- as well as the country's High Court. 
The appeals claim that Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's cabinet violated the main law.
In other news, Tariceanu said on Tuesday that Romania is making every effort to join the EU in 2007 as planned, but that it would not be a tragedy if entry were delayed by one year. 
That could happen under a contingency clause in the accession treaty, if the EU determines not all commitments have been met.

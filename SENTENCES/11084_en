ANKARA, Turkey -- The current increase in oil shipping across the Bosporus and the Dardanelles poses a major environmental threat, Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler said Monday (28 March). 
According to him, the amount of oil transported across the straits has increased by 50 per cent in the last three years. 
An estimated 8,000 tankers passed through the Bosporus in 2003 alone. 
Guler added that the new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which should become operational within several months, would ease the situation.

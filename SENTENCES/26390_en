PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The time has come for a TV channel that broadcasts in Serbian, International Civilian Representative (ICO) Pieter Feith and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci announced on Thursday (November 12th). 
"The ICO and the government of Kosovo are committed to establishing an independent broadcaster," the two officials said in a joint statement. 
"Work in the media sector for the past year has shown that Serbian speakers in Kosovo want to receive information and entertainment produced here in Kosovo, in their own language," Feith was quoted as saying. 
Thaci said he "supports freedom of expression in a mother tongue as a constitutional obligation and an inalienable human right for all".

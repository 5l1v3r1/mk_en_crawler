ATHENS, Greece -- In an interview Sunday (18 June), Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to re-open talks on Cyprus soon.
Speaking to the local newspaper Eleftherotypia, she also suggested a new proposal for reuniting the divided island may be in the works.
A future "Plan for a United European Cyprus" could arise from UN mediation efforts, Bakoyannis said.
In other news Sunday, Turkish media said a draft paper by the European Commission (EC) criticises Turkey for its slow reforms.
The document reportedly urges Ankara to curb the role of the military in politics, respect the rights of women and minorities, strengthen judicial independence and build better ties with Armenia and Greece.
The paper must be approved by the EC members before it is published in October.

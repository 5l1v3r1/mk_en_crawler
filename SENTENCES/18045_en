BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The chief of the EU's Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has criticised Bulgaria and praised Romania for their respective handling of EU aid.
Franz-Hermann Bruner said in an interview published on Monday (July 16th) that Sofia has yet to implement clear and transparent public tender procedures.
Bruner also warned the Bulgarian government that problems that are ignored cannot be solved.
OLAF is investigating 12 cases involving mishandling of EU funds in Bulgaria even before the country has begun to receive the large amounts of funds to which it is entitled as a member.
Romania, Bruner said, is four years ahead of Bulgaria in this area.

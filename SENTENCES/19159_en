PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU and NATO troops on Friday (June 29th) searched the home of Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic.
Inside the premises, they found Karadzic's wife Ljiljana Zelen Karadzic, his daughter Sonja and her two children.
The children were removed from the home while Italian police questioned the two women.
Troops removed some documentation from the house.
They were assisted by representatives of the UN war crimes tribunal and the Republika Srpska Interior Ministry.
A spokesman for the peacekeepers said the search was carried out to collect information on Karadzic's whereabouts and also to put pressure on war criminal support networks.
This was the seventh raid by EUFOR and NATO on the Karadzic family premises in Pale in the past two years.

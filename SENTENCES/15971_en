SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU representative to Macedonia Erwan Fouere demanded that the Badenter principle of the Ohrid Peace Accord, which stipulates protection of minority rights at both the central and local levels, be respected in full and by all local governors and political parties in the country. 
Fouere met with Izet Mexiti, mayor of the Skopje municipality of Cair, to discuss the issue after the Cair Council adopted a new emblem and municipal flag without the consent of the Macedonian councillors, who represent the minority community there. 
Fouere rejected such one-sided behavior and insisted the decision be revoked.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The press office of Serbia's President Boris Tadic said Friday (20 May) that Tadic would not meet with Kosovo counterpart Ibrahim Rugova at a future international conference due in Geneva in early June, as Rugova proposed. 
Tadic's office said any direct dialogue should take place either in Belgrade or Pristina.
In other news, Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said Friday that the EU would respect the results of Montenegro's referendum on independence. 
Speaking at the end of a three-day trip to the Balkans, the minister said such recognition was in line with the EU's commitment to democracy.

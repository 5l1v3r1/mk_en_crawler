PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) will be in charge of running a population and buildings census in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.
Public Administration Ministry spokesperson Majlinde Sinani-Lulaj said on Tuesday (March 22nd) it will be conducted "to respect the right of each individual to be counted and registered".
Serbs living in the north are expected to refuse to participate in the census that will be run by Pristina institutions between April 1st and 15th.
Belgrade has been urging all Serbs in Kosovo to boycott the process unless UNMIK conducts the census.

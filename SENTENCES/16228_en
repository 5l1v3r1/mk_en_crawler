SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts have uncovered the largest mass grave in BiH found to date.
The discovery was made at Jaz, near the village of Kamenica in the east of the country.
So far 133 complete skeletons and more than 900 body parts of Srebrenica massacre victims have been discovered, and authorities say the figure is likely to rise.
A ten-person team, including forensic experts from Canada and Serbia, is working at the site.
According to Murat Hurtic of the International Commission on Missing Persons, many of the remains were damaged because the bodies had been removed with bulldozers from the site where they were buried originally and were taken to Kamenica in an attempt to hide evidence of the atrocity.

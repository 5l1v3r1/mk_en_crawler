WASHINGTON, United States -- At a meeting in Washington on Friday (November 16th), High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and US Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns rejected any link between the future status of Kosovo and the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
They called on BiH leaders to meet their obligations and take over responsibility for the future of the country.
"Concrete steps taken by BiH political leaders will determine whether BiH will go further into isolation or towards European integration," the officials said in a joint press statement.
Burns also expressed the US government's full support for the actions of the high representative.
During his visit to the US capital, Lajcak also held talks with Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried, his deputy Rosemary DiCarlo, and the senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council, Judy Ansley.

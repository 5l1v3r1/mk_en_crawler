ANKARA, Turkey -- Former Eskesehir police chief Hanefi Avci was held in an Istanbul prison Wednesday (September 29th) on charges of ties to the Revolutionary Headquarters, a leftist militant group. 
Avci was arrested on Tuesday as part of an ongoing investigation into the group, which has been blamed for attacks on state targets. 
A court ordered he should remain in custody Wednesday. 
Avci received attention recently after publishing a book in which he said members of an Islamic movement run by preacher Fethullah Gulen had infiltrated the police and courts. 
He denies all charges.

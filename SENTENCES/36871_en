THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) decided Thursday (8 July) that Croatian war crimes indictee General Mirko Norac could be transferred back to Croatia, where he would remain in custody.
In approving the Croatian government's proposal, the tribunal set several conditions -- including a requirement that Norac would be treated as an ICTY detainee with all inherent rights.
Norac has pleaded not guilty to all five counts, including crimes against humanity and violation of the customs of war, stemming from a 1993 operation at the Medak Pocket, near Gospic.
In other news, authorities in Split signed a memorandum of understanding Thursday with USAID on the promotion and strengthening of public administration and organisation.
This is the first phase of USAID's long-term project on regional administration reform in the country, worth a total of $19m.

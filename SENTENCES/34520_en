TIRANA, Albania -- The tender for selecting the contractor to build a new thermal power plant is expected this month or next.
It would be Albania's first such plant in 20 years.
The World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the EBRD are providing the financing.
The country faces chronic power shortages, resulting from a lack of thermal power-generated electricity in dry years.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A recently launched official Serbian government Web site gives Belgrade's version of events in Kosovo, glossing over the Milosevic regime's repression of ethnic Albanians and concentrating instead on the displacement of Serbs and the ethnic riots of March 2004. 
It also claims that Islamic terrorism and organised crime were behind Kosovo's drive for independence from Belgrade. 
The site mentions Milosevic just once, in connection with what the government describes as "crimes committed by the previous regime secretly, in our name".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian authorities reported Sunday (23 July) that a bird flu outbreak reported last week in a village near the southern town of Kurdzhali may not involve the dangerous H5 or H7 strains of the avian virus. 
Scientists are now attributing the deaths to the Newcastle virus. 
Tests for the H5 and H7 strains have been negative. 
Veterinarians have culled about 2,100 domestic fowl and established a 3km quarantine zone around the affected village. 
The national crisis headquarters for combating the bird flu was due to hold a meeting in Slanchogled on Monday.

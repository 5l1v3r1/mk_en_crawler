ZAGREB, Croatia -- Pjer Simunovic, Croatia's national co-ordinator for NATO, said Thursday (11 November) that his country is ready to participate more actively in NATO operations.
Simunovic said the Adriatic Charter countries are preparing for participation by setting up joint military teams, conducting joint exercises and preventing the distribution of weapons of mass destruction in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean.
In other news, the Croatian government has asked parliament to approve an agreement with the United States that provides for the use of Croatian airspace, training grounds and air and naval facilities for training by the US European Command.
The document was signed in July.
Also Thursday, the government approved the country's 2005 budget.
The bill projects receipts of 11.4 billion euros and spending of 11.85 billion euros.
Finance Minister Ivan Suker said the budget deficit -- amounting to 3.7 percent of GDP -- would be covered in part by revenues from the sale of a major state-owned oil company.

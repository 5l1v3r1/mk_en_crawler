NEW YORK, United States -- Greece on Tuesday (October 7th) once again rejected a dual-name solution to the name dispute with Macedonia. 
Any new proposal from UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz will be "stillborn" if Macedonia insists on the double-name formula, Greek representative Adamantios Vassilakis warned after meeting with Nimetz in New York. 
Later, Nimetz met with Macedonian representative Nikola Dimitrov, who said Macedonia expects the UN envoy to make a "concrete step" Wednesday, when he is scheduled to hold a joint meeting with both countries' negotiators.

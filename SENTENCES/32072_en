BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- According to media sources, a US weapons inspection team has arrived in Yugoslavia to determine whether all arms trading activities with Iraq have ended, as the government claims. 
Tanjug and AP reported the unannounced visit on Monday (18 November). 
The US government has not confirmed the mission, but Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic urged other authorities in the country to co-operate fully. 
The government has admitted that state arms dealer Jugoimport has exported weapons to Iraq, in violation of the UN embargo. 
Several senior officials were fired as a result of the scandal.

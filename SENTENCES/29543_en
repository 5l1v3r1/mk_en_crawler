ANKARA, Turkey -- The outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has decided to extend its ceasefire with Turkey by another month, PKK commander Murat Karayilan said on Thursday (September 30th).
He added that the organisation would consider the possibility of a lasting truce if Turkish authorities accept their demands for greater rights for Kurds and the release of jailed Kurdish politicians.
"If real efforts at peace that build mutual trust take shape over the next month, we will turn this into an unlimited ceasefire.
If not, we will re-evaluate," he said.
The PKK announced in mid-August that it would refrain from militant action, and then extended that initial ceasefire for a week on September 20th.

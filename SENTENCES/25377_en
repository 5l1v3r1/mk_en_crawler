TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama filed a lawsuit on Tuesday (December 22nd) against Prime Minister Sali Berisha, accusing him of libel. 
Rama says Berisha has "repeatedly and publicly offended" him. 
Late last month, Berisha gave a long speech in parliament, including what he described as the "untold truth" about Rama's personal life. 
Rama refuted all of Berisha's claims as lies. 
It is now up to prosecutors to decide whether to accept the lawsuit.

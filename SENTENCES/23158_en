SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government has fulfilled 90% of the targets set in its programme, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Saturday (November 1st) in a speech marking the 100th day of his cabinet. 
He noted that 183 planned projects and measures have been implemented and that a broad range of reforms have been intensified. 
Gruevski added that the most significant progress has been made in the economy where industrial growth has reached 15.7% and pensions and administrative sector wages have increased.
The main opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia disagreed with Gruevski's analysis, saying the government has done a lot of talking and spent a lot of money in its first 100 days, but has failed to achieve any significant results.

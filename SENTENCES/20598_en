SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Talks over the new police reform draft submitted by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak will continue on Wednesday (September 12th), the daily Nezavisne Novine reported on Monday, citing sources within local parties.
They will be held on the expert level with representatives of all political parties and Deputy High Representative Jozek Pandur.
On Saturday, the main party in Republika Srpska, the Party of Independent Social Democrats, indicated it may try to delay the process again.
The Serb member of the BiH tripartite presidency, Nebojsa Radmanovic, said the police reform negotiations should be held simultaneously with those on constitutional reform.
Lajcak has set an end-of-September deadline for agreeing on police reform, a requirement for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

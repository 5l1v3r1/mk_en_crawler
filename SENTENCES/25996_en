ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament is expected to vote Friday (October 16th) on a proposal to strip former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic of his immunity as a lawmaker from the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
The parliamentary panel on mandate issues proposed it on Thursday, clearing the way for legal proceedings against Roncevic. 
Prosecutors want his immunity stripped over a 2004 procurement deal involving military trucks. 
They say the contract cost the state millions of kunas.

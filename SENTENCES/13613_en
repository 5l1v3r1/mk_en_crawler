ANKARA, Turkey -- The first programmes in Kurdish were broadcast Thursday (23 March) on two regional private TV channels and a radio station in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, according to local media reports. 
Earlier this month, the Turkish Supreme Board of Radio and Television allowed private regional media to broadcast in Kurdish.
In other news, at least 19 people were injured, ten of them police officers, in clashes between police and Kurdish demonstrators in the southeastern town of Hakkari. 
The Kurds were protesting the arrest of Sebahattin Suvagci, the provincial head of a now-dissolved pro-Kurdish party.
Also Thursday, Turkey's State Minister Ali Babacan visited Stockholm. 
Following talks with Swedish Trade Minister Thomas Ostros, Babacan announced Turkey's willingness to boost political and economic co-operation with Scandinavian countries.

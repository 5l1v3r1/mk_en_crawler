BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted on Monday (5 June) to declare the republic's independence, just two days after Montenegro split from the union.
The opposition walked out after a bitter debate and did not take part in the vote;
the remaining 126 deputies unanimously backed the declaration.
Parliament also ordered state institutions to complete the process of transition within the next 45 days.
Serbia, as the legal successor of the union with Montenegro, inherits its seat in the UN and other international organisations.
The ambassadors of the former union will now represent Belgrade only.
In other news, testifying before a court in Nicosia, former Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic claimed that Greek Cypriot authorities allowed the Milosevic regime to siphon off billions of dollars during the embargo against Yugoslavia.
Batic said "sacks and suitcases full of cash" were flown from Belgrade to Nicosia and deposited in accounts of front companies held by the Cyprus Popular Bank.

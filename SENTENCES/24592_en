PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Jordan on Tuesday (July 7th) became the 61st country worldwide to recognise Kosovo's independence.
It is also the 5th member of the Arab League to offer formal recognition.
In other news, a new report published Tuesday concludes internally displaced persons (IDP) face serious difficulties returning to Kosovo.
"A decade after the war, there are still obstacles when people try to make a reality their options for return," Walter Kaelin, representative of the Secretary-General for the Human Rights of IDP, said.
These include unemployment, relatively few schools for minorities and property issues.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- After parliamentary approval Monday (December 22nd), President Traian Basescu swore in the new cabinet headed by Prime Minister Emil Boc.
Basescu described the new government, formed by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party, as Romania's strongest since the anti-communist revolution, given its majority support in parliament.
Boc pledged to maintain strong partnerships with all institutions -- the presidency, the parliament and the church, as well as with civil society, trade unions and employers' associations.
The new cabinet's mission will be to tackle the economic crisis, said Boc, vowing his government "will reduce costs by 20%".
Key appointees include Finance Minister Gheorghe Pogea, Minister of Economy Adriean Videanu, Defence Minister Mihai Stanisoara and Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament approved late Wednesday (March 3rd) an amendment to a law on referendums, which shortens the waiting period for a public vote from 120 to 60 days. 
Under the new provision, any constitutional amendment ratified by parliament with 330 to 366 of the total 550 votes will be subject to referendum in no more than 60 days. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his government is willing to do whatever it takes to amend the constitution by year's end. 
The opposition Republican People's Party reiterated Thursday it would challenge any possible constitutional amendment before the Constitutional Court.

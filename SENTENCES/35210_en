SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The drafting of a protocol on the BiH Institute for Missing Persons (INO) should be finalised by the end of this summer, said INO chief Gordon Bacon on Sunday (25 April).
The International Commission on Missing Persons founded the institute in 2000, but the BiH presidency only decided to establish it at the state level last year.
In other news, the BiH Constitutional Court ruled on Friday that the use of ethnic prefixes -- such as Srpski (Serb) -- in the names of Republika Srpska (RS) cities and towns is not compliant with the BiH Constitution.
The Court also requested that the RS Parliament harmonise laws on administrative division, local government and the Serb part of Sarajevo with the court's position.

TETOVO, Macedonia -- Thousands gathered in the central square in Tetovo amid heavy police presence on Friday (October 19th) to support Kosovo's independence and Macedonia's faster Euro-Atlantic integration. 
"What Serbia did to the Kosovo people motivates all Albanians to commit themselves to the goal of an independent Kosovo," said Menduh Thaci, leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians, which organised the protest. 
He reiterated support for Martti Ahtisaari's plan and condemned all those seeking the division of Kosovo, claiming such an action would destabilise the region.

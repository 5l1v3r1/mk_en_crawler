SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A computer problem has caused a delay in the procedure for issuing new single ID cards in BiH, the head of the Citizens' Identity Protection System (CIPS) Directorate, Mirko Skrbic, told a news conference Wednesday (8 January).
He says it may be the end of the month before the new cards are issued.
The CIPS project, worth about $16m, is aimed at meeting EU and international standards for secure documentation.

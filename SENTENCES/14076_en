BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Local media is reporting that Serbian authorities are negotiating the surrender of Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic.
Aides to Prime Minister of Serbia Vojislav Kostunica and Interior Minister of Republika Srpska Darko Matijasevic reportedly established contact with the fugitive earlier this month.
There are also reports of ongoing talks for the surrender of fugitive Stojan Zupljanin.
Rumours of Mladic's impending surrender have circulated in the past, only to come to naught.
On Friday, UN war crimes tribunal President Theodor Meron urged Kostunica to step up co-operation with the international court.

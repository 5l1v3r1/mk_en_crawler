The Krivolak military range in southeast Macedonia is slated for modernisation this year, with the government seeking to make it an international training centre that matches NATO standards. 
According to Defence Minister Zoran Konjanovski, Skopje will invite the militaries of NATO member states to use the range.
"Because of Macedonia's strategic commitment to NATO and EU membership and its commitment to actively contribute to international missions, the need for a training centre meeting the standards intended for our armed forces and the armed forces of NATO members became evident," Konjanovski said on February 4th, describing the project as a "priority".
The United States, Denmark and other countries have contributed financial support for upgrading Krivolak, he added.
The first phase of the modernisation, which the ministry expects to complete by October, involves the construction of a training ground for operations within an urban environment, an area for parachute jumps and other air operations, training grounds for atomic, biological and chemical "ABC" units, a communications and information system and a video surveillance system. 
Units up to battalion size can train on the range.
To make urban combat training more realistic, the Krivolak project envisions construction of mock towns resembling communities in crisis areas such as Afghanistan, Chad or Iraq.
Details of the second phase, starting in 2010, will depend on the needs of the Macedonian and partner militaries, which are expected to sign agreements. 
Planners expect to install simulators, computer equipment, navigation devices and other technology.
The planned upgrade does not sit well with some local residents, who are expressing concern about live fire. 
Military officials, however, say the nearby communities have already been co-existing with a shooting range on the premises.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN High Representative for BiH Paddy Ashdown decided Wednesday (11 June) to cut funding to two parties in the Hercegovina-Neretva Canton by 10 per cent. 
Ashdown said the sanction followed failed attempts by the Party of Democratic Action and the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina to form a local government by Wednesday's deadline. 
He also ordered reductions in the salaries of the county's acting ministers. 
Late last week, the two parties said they reached an agreement to nominate ministers representing minority groups but did not manage to observe the timetable.

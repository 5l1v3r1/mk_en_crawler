ATHENS, Greece -- Two members of the ruling New Democracy Party -- both of whom until recently held ministerial posts in the government -- quit parliament Thursday (September 3rd) and Friday. 
Former Merchant Marine Minister Giorgos Voulgarakis said that he will not take part in the upcoming snap elections that were announced Thursday by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis. 
Voulgarakis has been linked to a scandal involving illegal income from offshore companies.
Culture Minister Michalis Liapis, a cousin of Prime Minister Karamanlis, is also leaving parliament, saying on Thursday that he has no appetite for another term as a lawmaker. 
He too was a target of media attention over suspected co-operation with managers of the Greek division of the German company Siemens.

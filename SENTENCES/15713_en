CRAWFORD, United States -- US President George Bush called Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday (22 July) to discuss the current crisis in Lebanon. 
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the two leaders focused on ways to address the humanitarian needs of the people of Lebanon. 
They also discussed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's upcoming visit to the Middle East.
Bush also told the prime minister that the United States was ready to work with Turkey to put an end to the terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party. 
More than a dozen Turkish troops were killed by Kurdish militants a week ago, prompting Ankara to threaten tougher measures against the militant group, which has bases in Iraq.

CAGLAVICA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Serbs in central Kosovo are asking for increased protection by KFOR and the UNMIK police.
The councils of the mainly Serb-populated villages of Caglavica, Laplje Selo and Preoce made the joint appeal following a special session Saturday (March 10th) that focused on recent incidents targeting local Serbs.
In other news, the Kosovo authorities Saturday prolonged the detention of the Vetevendosje (Self-determination) movement leader Albin Kurti by 60 additional days.
Kurti has been in custody since February 10th, when a rally staged by his organisation turned violent and resulted in the deaths of two people.

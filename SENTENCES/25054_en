SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Imer Selmani was re-elected on Saturday (December 26th) as leader of the New Democracy Party at its first congress held in Skopje. 
Selmani said that because the country has no alternative to membership in NATO and the EU, the ruling parties must make every effort to resolve the name dispute with Greece. 
He described the Ohrid Framework Agreement as a pillar of the multiethnic state.

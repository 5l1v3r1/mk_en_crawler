SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak on Monday (October 6th) welcomed the successful local elections at the weekend and thanked all officials, observers and volunteers across BiH for ensuring the polls remained free of major incidents.
He also urged political parties to immediately return to the EU agenda and meet the remaining objectives and conditions set by the PIC Steering Board in February.
"I expect everyone to focus his attention on the key priority for BiH in the coming months -- full implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement," Lajcak said.
He insisted the main short-term goal should be resolving the state property issue and the future status of Brcko, both of which are prerequisites for closing his Office of the High Representative.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU defence ministers agreed on Monday (May 26th) that EUFOR will remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) due to security concerns related to Kosovo's independence.
"The region is not yet fully stable," said Slovenian Defence Minister Karl Erjavec, chairman of the meeting in Brussels.
EUFOR is comprised of about 2,500 troops.
Meanwhile, EU security chief Javier Solana urged BiH parties to start implementing police reforms.
He also implied that progress in this area would lead to the transformation of the Office of the High Representative into an Office of the EU Special Representative.

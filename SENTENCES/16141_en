BELGRADE, Serbia -- The OSCE Ambassador to Belgrade, Hans Ola Urstad, warned on Friday (11 August) that some texts in the recently amended broadcasting law restrict the rights of the media and should be withdrawn immediately. 
Analysis conducted by the OSCE found that the new amendments -- mostly related to the activity of the Republican Broadcasting Agency -- contradict both the Serbian Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights. 
Calling for revisions, Urstad said amendments should be made in consultation with international institutions.

TIRANA, Albania -- The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will provide aid to victims of landmines in Albania, UNHCR spokeswoman Jolanda Xhunga announced Wednesday (30 October).
The aid will extend to more than 200 families in the districts of Tropoja, Has and KukÃ«s, near the Albanian-Kosovo border.
The UNHCR will provide basic appliances, blankets, tents, sanitary materials and related necessities, and will also aid families affected by severe flooding in August and September, when thousands lost their homes.

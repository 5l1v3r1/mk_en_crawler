BELGRADE, Serbia -- Talks between Belgrade and Pristina are essential to the region's European perspective and should result in a solution to practical issues and improve daily life, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said in an interview with Belgrade-based Politika on Monday (March 7th).
She pointed out that seeking solutions to problems via dialogue is the European way, and that one goal of the talks is to bring Belgrade and Pristina closer to the EU.
Ashton added that the talks will not tackle Kosovo's status issue.
The EU-brokered talks are to start on Tuesday in Brussels.

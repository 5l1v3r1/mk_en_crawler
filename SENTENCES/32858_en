ATHENS, Greece -- Greek police have arrested three suspected members of a radical left-wing group in raids over the weekend.
The authorities in Athens announced on Sunday (2 February) that the three were thought to belong to the Revolutionary Popular Struggle (ELA).
The group has claimed responsibility for more than 100 bombings and killings of police officers.
ELA is believed to be tied to a larger terrorist group, 17 November.
Nineteen members of 17 November are scheduled for trial next month.
The group of suspects who were arrested over the weekend included the mayor of a Mediterranean island, an architect and a private company employee.
Four other people were questioned and released.(AP, AFP - 02/02/03)

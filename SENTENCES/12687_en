BUCHAREST, Romania -- About two months after the Greater Romania Party (PRM) changed its name and leadership in a bid to become more moderate, the party returned to its roots and welcomed back previous leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
At the party congress Saturday (4 June), delegates dumped the name Greater Romania People's Party that was introduced in mid-March.
They also voted out chairman Corneliu Ciontu and vice chairman Anghel Stanciu.
Tudor, known for his ultranationalist stance, was invited to take back the PRM presidency.
He has said the "popular" idea was not working for the party.

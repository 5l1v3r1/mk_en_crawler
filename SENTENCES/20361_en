ZAGREB, Croatia -- War crimes suspect General Branimir Glavas has been moved from a prison hospital to the intensive care unit at a local hospital, his lawyer Ante Madunic said on Wednesday (December 12th).
Glavas, who began a hunger strike on November 7th and subsists only on water, is in grave condition, Madunic said.
Glavas was indicted in April for ordering members of a unit he commanded in 1991 to abduct, torture and murder about a dozen Serbs in Osjek.

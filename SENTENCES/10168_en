SIROKI BRIJEG, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH could join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and begin Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU within six to seven months if reforms speed up, according to High Representative Paddy Ashdown. 
During a visit Tuesday (28 September) to Siroki Brijeg, Ashdown urged authorities to step up their efforts, saying the country has a great opportunity before it.
In other news, the members of BiH's tripartite presidency met on Tuesday with the outgoing commander of SFOR, Major General Virgil Packett.

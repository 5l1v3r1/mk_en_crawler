BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Acting Serbian President Natasa Micic decided Tuesday (22 April) to lift the state of emergency imposed immediately after the 12 March assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
"Organised crime has received a final blow," Micic said in a televised speech, as she announced her decision.
"Milosevic's crime apparatus has been dismantled and the crime spiral that has been eating away at our country has been halted.
The country is defended.
These 42 days changed Serbia forever, for the better," she added.
While the emergency measure was broadly criticised by human rights groups as well as Serbian opposition parties, EU officials backed the government's efforts to deal with organised crime.
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic stressed that lifting the measure does not signal any lessening of those efforts.

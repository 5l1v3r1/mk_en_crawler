PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The date of the presidential elections will be announced next week, according to the leading candidate for the job, Parliament Speaker Filip Vujanovic.
He said Thursday (6 March) that he believes it should happen as soon as possible.
He has been serving as acting president since November.
Last week, the presidential election law was amended, eliminating a controversial 50 per cent voter turnout requirement, which resulted in two failed rounds.
Meanwhile, the Serbian-Montenegrin Parliament has approved the law on electing a president of the new federation.
It allows the legislature to elect the president and proceed with electing cabinet ministers.

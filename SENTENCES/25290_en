NEW YORK United States -- The Turkish government has asked parliament to authorise continued military operations against Kurdish rebels across the border in Iraq, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the 64th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Sunday (September 27th). 
"We are in favour of another one-year extension," Erdogan was quoted by the Anadolu news agency as saying.
Authorisation for cross-border activities against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) expires on October 17th. 
Turkey says northern Iraq serves as a base for thousands of Kurdish militants who are launching attacks against Turkey from there.

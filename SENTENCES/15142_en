ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), the third largest party in the country, announced on Tuesday (29 August) that its caucus leader, Miroslav Rozic, has resigned.
HSP Chairman Anto Dapic will assume the post.
Media reports suggest Rozic's recent criticism of Dapic and his closest associates may have led to his departure.

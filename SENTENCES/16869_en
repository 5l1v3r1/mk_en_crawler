ROME, Italy -- Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli said on Friday (November 3rd) that Italy might open its labor market to Romanian workers once the Balkan country joins the EU on January 1st.
"Today [Romania] is no longer of a country of forced immigration for economic reasons.
On the contrary, it is a country where in many places there is total employment," he said after meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu.
So far only the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden have announced that they would not restrict migration from Bulgaria and Romania.

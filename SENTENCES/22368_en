SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR troops searched the home of Liljana Zelen-Karadzic, wife of war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic, in the town of Pale, 20km southeast of Sarajevo early on Tuesday (July 15th). 
"The search was for material and/or information that could assist The Hague war crimes tribunal in the ongoing search for and capture of persons indicted by the tribunal and putting pressure on networks believed to be involved in protecting these persons," EUFOR said. 
"Useful information was gathered from the scene and taken for analysis," it added. 
Karadzic has been on the run for 13 years.

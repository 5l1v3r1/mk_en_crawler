SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko launched an inventory of state property Wednesday (August 12th). 
He had warned that his Office of the High Representative (OHR) would initiate the process, as the working group responsible for the job clearly could not complete the inventory by the September 30th deadline. 
The group could not even agree on a methodology used to collect data. 
Information from Land Registry offices and Cadastres will be used to decide the future apportionment of this property, the first of five conditions required for closing down the OHR.

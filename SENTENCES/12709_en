ISTANBUL, Turkey -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Thursday (5 May) that democratic reforms in Turkey are already advanced enough to be irreversible.
"In my opinion there is no turning back.
The reforms are irreversible not only because of the EU [accession process] but because they are also in the interest of the Turkish people," he said at a conference in Istanbul.
Rehn reassured Ankara that its progress towards EU membership would be judged solely on merit.
Accession talks are scheduled to begin on 3 October.
In other news, the UN General Assembly on Thursday confirmed Kemal Dervis, a Turkish national, as head of the UNDP.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Stuart Jones said on Monday (March 2nd) that the situation in BiH was not good and that the country had made no progress since his previous visit last year.
Jones commented after a meeting with BiH presidency member Zeljko Komsic in Sarajevo.
They discussed the political situation in the country, its future and Euro-Atlantic integration, as well as US support for BiH.
Komsic's office issued a statement afterwards saying Jones had praised the agreement on constitutional reforms reached recently but expressed concern over failures in implementing other conditions necessary for eventual EU accession.
Jones also said he was concerned about rhetoric by certain politicians as well as problems related to state and military property.

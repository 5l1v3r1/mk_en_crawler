BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal will convene next week -- again without the Montenegrin representatives, said panel chairman Rasim Ljajic. 
He added that the council must fulfil all of its obligations by 23 November, when The Hague tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, is expected to present her report to the UN Security Council. 
Next week, the co-operation council will discuss requests by families of indictees for assistance as well as efforts to relieve more witnesses of the obligation to keep national and military secrets. 
Montenegrin officials say their boycott will continue until Serbia starts to co-operate fully with the tribunal.
Meanwhile, the tribunal announced on Wednesday that Slobodan Milosevic's lawyers have filed a request to be dismissed from the trial. 
Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins, who were appointed in September to represent the defendant, argued in a letter to the judges that they are unable to perform their duties because Milosevic refuses to co-operate with them. 
They also complain that witnesses they call refuse to testify.

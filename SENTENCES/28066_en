LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Slovenia ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia after parliament adopted it unanimously Wednesday (October 20th).
The ratification comes only days before the October 25th meeting of the EU foreign ministers council.
They will debate whether to forward Serbia's membership application to the European Commission.
While Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar pledged his country's full support, The Netherlands is expected to oppose steps forward until Serbia arrests and extradites war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.

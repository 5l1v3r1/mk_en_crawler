SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court confirmed on Wednesday (9 August) that prosecutors have charged former BiH presidency member Mirko Sarovic with soliciting false testimony.
Prosecutors say Sarovic, already standing trial for organised crime, sent a letter -- while he was in custody at the Doboj prison in late February -- to a witness in the trial, asking the person to lie to the court.
A guard at the prison who delivered the letter was also charged.

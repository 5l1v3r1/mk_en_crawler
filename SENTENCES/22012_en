BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic and Europol chief Max-Peter Ratzel signed an agreement Thursday (September 18th) to co-operate in the fight against terrorism. 
Following the signing ceremony in Belgrade, Dacic said another pact defining the specific aspects of co-operation would follow this "strategic" agreement. 
He added that boosting co-operation with Europol is significant in terms of Serbia's prospects for liberalising its visa regime with the EU. 
Ratzel stressed the importance of the agreement for Europol, explaining it creates reliable partners in the Western Balkans.

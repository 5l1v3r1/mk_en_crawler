PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Acting President Jakup Krasniqi is not ruling out the possibility of early general elections to avoid institutional fragility. 
Only a day after he took office, Krasniqi said that relations between the coalition partners, the Democratic Party and the Democratic League (LDK) are frozen. 
Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday (September 29th), Krasniqi also conceded that elections depend on the ability of the Central Elections Commission to prepare for them. 
Political analysts have suggested elections could take place in early December. 
Talks with Belgrade might also be affected, as Pristina wants to enter the process with solid institutions. 
Krasniqi also said that the resignation of President Fatmir Sejdiu has caused a "small political crisis" but denied any institutional gap. 
Sejdiu resigned after the Constitutional Court ruled he had violated the constitution by serving as both president and leader of the LDK at the same time.

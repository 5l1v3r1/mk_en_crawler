ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new police unit specialised in fighting organised crime began work Monday (October 27th). 
The Police National Office for Suppressing Corruption and Organised Crime will co-operate with prosecutors and the existing Office for the Suppression of Organised Crime and Corruption in the investigation of suspects and the origin of their wealth. 
Tihomir Kralj heads the new unit, organised in response to a handful of high-profile cases. 
The latest was a car bombing Thursday that killed the owner and marketing director of the Nacional weekly, Ivo Pukanic and Niko Franic, respectively. 
Police announced several case-related arrests Monday in Zagreb and in Vukovar but did not elaborate.

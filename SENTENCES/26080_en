ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader refuted on Tuesday (December 15th) Austrian media allegations that he accepted commission from Austrian Hypo Alpe Adria Bank to help it do business in Croatia. 
He also rejected claims that the bank has financed the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
The Austrian newspaper Die Presse reports that Sanader helped the bank start operations in Croatia and in return, received a large fee. 
Hypo Alpe Adria, which had suffered losses from bad loans in Eastern Europe, was nationalised on Monday.

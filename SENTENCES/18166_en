PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The head of Kosovo's telecommunications authority, Anton Berisha, escaped a second assassination attempt Thursday (April 12th) when his car was hit by mortar fire in the village of Loznica, 35km west of Pristina. 
A policeman escorting him reportedly was wounded and taken to hospital. 
Police have made three arrests. 
In February, a gunmen opened fire on Berisha's car, only days after the telecom regulator awarded the license for Kosovo's second mobile operator to a consortium between Telekom Slovenija and a Kosovo internet company. 
Berisha had been under police protection ever since.

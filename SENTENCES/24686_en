BUCHAREST, Romania -- Senate chairman and Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana announced on Sunday (June 7th) he is withdrawing from the country's Supreme Defence Council (CSAT).
He said he is protesting President Traian Basescu's "attempt to use the army's positive image for election purposes", a reference to Basescu's recent visits to Iraq and Afghanistan where he met with Romanian military contingents.

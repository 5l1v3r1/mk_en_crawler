BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu suggested on Monday (October 8th) that the next parliamentary elections be held on the same day as local elections in June 2008.
Reactions varied, with the Conservative Party saying the idea has potential, and the Greater Romania Party opposing it.
The Democratic Party says it does not trust Tariceanu, and the Liberal Democratic Party describes it as "a cunning move".

ANKARA, Turkey -- Authorities launched an investigation of prosecutors involved in the case of the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon, Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said on Tuesday (September 9th). 
He told reporters he appointed two inspectors to investigate a number of complaints made against the prosecutors, including Istanbul Public Prosecutor Zekeriya Oz. 
In June, authorities arrested 86 suspects, including retired army officers, academics, politicians and journalists, as part of the controversial Ergenekon investigation. 
They allegedly planned to incite chaos and disorder to trigger a coup against the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) government.

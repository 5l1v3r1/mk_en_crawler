BUCHAREST, Romania -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Thursday (12 August) that Romania could complete its accession talks with the EU by the end of this year if it maintains the current rate of reforms.
"The European Council planned for this autumn will no doubt decide that the conditions have been met and it is realistic to think that talks about membership will end," he said.
Completing the negotiations by the end of the year would allow Romania to join the EU in 2007 with Bulgaria.
Addressing reporters in Bucharest, Schroeder also highlighted the importance of economic ties between the two countries, describing Romania as a "real economic partner".
While in Romania, Schroeder visited the grave of his father, who was killed there during World War II.
Fritz Schroeder died in October 1944 and was buried with eight other German soldiers in Ceanu Mare.
His son was six months old at the time.

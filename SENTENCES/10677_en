FOCA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The town of Foca hosted a conference Saturday (10 October) on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia's (ICTY) fact-finding activities regarding war crimes committed there during the BiH conflict.
The ICTY Outreach Programme and the Republika Srpska Helsinki Board sponsored the forum, which gathered representatives of the local community and judiciary, NGOs, and victims' associations.
Information was presented on crimes that occurred when Serb paramilitary forces overran the area in 1992.
Participants agreed it is crucial to bring to justice all those responsible for the crimes and that facing the truth is a condition for building trust in BiH.

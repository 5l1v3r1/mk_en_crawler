ATHENS, Greece -- Police say they are concerned about the possible reappearance of the left-wing radical group Revolutionary Struggle following a foiled bombing in Athens, local media reported on Saturday (October 25th).Police detonated a homemade bomb Friday outside the headquarters of oil giant Royal Dutch Shell in the southern suburb of Palaio Faliron.
An anonymous caller had warned the bomb would explode in 20 minutes.
The device, a plastic toolbox with a timer linked to 3kg of dynamite, would have caused a massive blast, according to police.
The materials used led investigators to the Revolutionary Struggle, which has not claimed any attacks for several months.
Revolutionary Struggle emerged after the police dismantled the leftist terror group November 17.

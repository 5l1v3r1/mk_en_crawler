THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN investigators have found "no reliable evidence" of human organ trafficking in Kosovo, Olga Kavran, spokeswoman for prosecutors at The Hague, said on Wednesday (April 16th).
She explained that any continuation of the matter is being left to UNMIK and other authorities to decide.
Former chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said in a recently published book that Albanian leaders in Kosovo, including current Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, helped remove organs from the bodies of around 300 Serb prisoners in the summer of 1999.

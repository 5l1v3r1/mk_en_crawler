BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Some 94,000 identified victims -- civilians and soldiers -- lost their lives in the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH, according to a study by the BiH Research and Documentation Centre. 
Presenting the results at a conference in Banja Luka on Friday (16 December), centre chief Mirsad Tokac specified that the figure refers to the number of victims whose identity is known, while the actual death toll probably exceeds 100,000.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic rejected on Monday (August 24th) media speculations that he plans to leave politics.
The Zagreb-based daily Jutarnji List quoted sources close to him within the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), who said Bebic has wanted to quit politics on two occasions over the past few years, but changed his mind following conversations with former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
Bebic says such speculation is only an attempt to weaken the cabinet of current Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and to cause rifts within the HDZ.

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- On Tuesday (10 December), former monarch Constantine denied any aspirations towards changing the Greek constitution. 
In an interview with Mega TV, he said he did not want Greece transformed from a parliamentary to a presidential republic, so that he might run in the presidential elections. 
But he did acknowledge that he preferred a system closer to that of Portugal, where the president has more authority than in Greece. 
Constantine also protested against the complicated procedure he faces to restore his citizenship. 
In exile since 1967, he lives in London.

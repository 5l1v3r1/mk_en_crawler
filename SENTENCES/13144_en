ZAGREB, Croatia -- Slobodan Davidovic, a former member of the Serbian paramilitary unit Scorpions, appeared before the Zagreb County Court Friday (28 October) and pleaded not guilty to charges of war crimes.
Davidovic, 52, faces charges in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre as well as the torture of Croatian army soldiers.
The suspect was arrested in Croatia in mid-June after his identity was established on the basis of a videotape showing Serb paramilitaries executing men taken prisoner at Srebrenica.
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 12 December.

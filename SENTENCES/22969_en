ZAGREB, Croatia -- Retired General Ivan Korade, charged with four murders, was found dead after a shootout with police in northern Croatia on Thursday (April 3rd). 
One police officer was killed during the operation to capture him. 
Officials say Korade committed suicide after the gunfight.
Korade went missing last week after police found four bodies in two villages in the Zagorje region, where he lived. 
Hundreds of police officers, supported by helicopters and special cameras, had joined the search for him.

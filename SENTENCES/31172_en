BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities in Serbia declared a state of emergency in some central and western parts of the country on Thursday (December 2nd).
Torrential rains have swollen the Drina River, forcing about 140 people to evacuate amid flooded houses, farmlands and roads.
Power cuts and a lack of drinking water were reported in the area near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where water levels are rising dangerously as well.
Authorities in the Croatian town of Metkovic also declared a state of emergency;
700 houses have been flooded there.
In northern Montenegro, meanwhile, the number of evacuees has doubled since Wednesday, to 600 people on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Kosovo Security Forces (KSF) will help authorities deal with massive floods in northern Albania.
The two governments struck a deal on assistance Thursday.
Kosovo personnel will start arriving on Friday.
Hardest hit is Shkodra, where hundreds of families are being evacuated by boat.
Thousands more remain trapped inside flooded houses and apartment buildings.
Opposition political parties accuse the government of failure and demand its resignation, as this is the fifth time this year Shkodra has been hit by floods.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Army chief General Zdravko Ponos says military co-operation with the United States will continue, to ensure regional stability. 
He met on Monday (October 20th) with Admiral Michael G. 
Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Though the two countries have completely opposite positions regarding Kosovo, co-operation is necessary Ponos told a joint press conference after the meeting. 
He noted Serbia and the United States have done much to strengthen bilateral relations since 2003. 
"The military relationship [between the two countries] is very different from what it was in the 1990s. 
In 2003 we started to rebuild that. 
And that is a big investment to be so easily taken down," he said. 
Mullen said he had a frank discussion with Ponos "about where we stand" with Kosovo. 
He is the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to visit Belgrade since 1951.

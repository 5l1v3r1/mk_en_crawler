BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik agreed on Tuesday (June 17th) in Banja Luka that constitutional reform talks will begin immediately after the October 5th local elections.
Lajcak reiterated that BiH would not be able to implement an EU reform agenda leading to candidate status under the current constitutional order.
Lajcak also noted that since BiH signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU this week, all parties must guarantee a pro-European atmosphere before and during the local elections.
The two officials also discussed the upcoming meeting of the Peace Implementation Council, at which BiH aims to prove it has fulfilled three of the five conditions for closing down the Office of the High Representative.

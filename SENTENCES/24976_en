ATHENS, Greece -- A ban on smoking in public places takes effect in Greece on Wednesday (July 1st), media reported.
Parliament adopted the measure last year, to comply with EU regulations designed to protect people from second-hand smoke.
Under the new provisions, smoking will be prohibited in all restaurants, bars, offices, and in public transport.
The law also imposes fines of between 1,000 and 20,000 euros for selling cigarettes or alcohol to minors.
An estimated 40% of Greeks smoke -- the highest percentage in Europe.
Two previous laws introduced in 2002 and 2003 were largely ignored.

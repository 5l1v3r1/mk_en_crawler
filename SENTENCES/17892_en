SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski on Monday (December 18th) dismissed the Army's Commander of Logistical Support, Colonel Ilija Skordovski, following a recent scandal involving the illegal transfer of army weapons. 
Last week, Macedonian police seized a large amount of weapons during a routine check of three trucks with Bulgarian registration. 
The firearms included 300 army machine guns with stands, and 33 mortars.

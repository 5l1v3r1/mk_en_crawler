BUCHAREST, Romania -- A diplomatic row between Bucharest and Chisinau escalated at the weekend, with Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin weighing in.
The quarrel began ten days ago, when Moldovan Deputy Interior Minister Valentin Zubic said a Romanian consulate official in Chisinau issued visas in exchange for bribes.
Romanian President Traian Basescu then accused Moldova of fabricating the allegations.
Voronin fired back on Sunday (August 26th), accusing Romania of irredentism and attempting to occupy Moldova.
He also said he opposes opening Romanian consulate departments in Cahul and Balti.

TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha on Thursday (December 11th) rejected charges of corruption and abuse of power that the General Prosecutor's Office published on Wednesday. 
The charges stem from 2006, when he was transport and communications minister, overseeing tenders for construction of a section of the Durres-Kukes Highway. 
During a parliament session Thursday, Basha insisted Socialist Party leader Edi Rama was behind the charges. 
Opposition lawmakers were unconvinced and called for Basha's immediate resignation.
The government issued a statement Thursday defending the controversial infrastructure project and vowed to support Basha.

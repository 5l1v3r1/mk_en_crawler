ATHENS, Greece -- Somali pirates have released a hijacked Greek-owned tanker after its owners paid ransom, Greece's merchant marine ministry said on Saturday (November 22nd).
The pirates set free the ship, MV Genius, on Friday.
It is now sailing toward the United Arab Emirates, a ministry spokesman said.
The crew is safe.
Pirates seized the vessel in late September in the Gulf of Aden, near the Horn of Africa.

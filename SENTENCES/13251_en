SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative Martin Ney has called on the Federation of BiH (FBiH) government to transfer the headquarters of five entity ministries in Mostar.
According to a press release Sunday (27 November), Ney sent a letter to FBiH Prime Minister Ahmet Hadzipasic, noting that the transfer was stipulated in the FBiH Constitution.
Ney's letter also suggested that if FBiH authorities fail to tackle the issue, High Representative Paddy Ashdown is likely to intervene.
Also Sunday, BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic said his Party of Democratic Progress would withdraw its support for the Republika Srpska (RS) government and start acting as an opposition party in the RS Parliament.
Ivanic accused the ruling Serb Democratic Party of a lack of reforms and privatisation delays.

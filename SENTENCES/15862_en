PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Kosovo Parliament on Thursday (October 19th) adopted a declaration condemning the inclusion of Kosovo in the new Serbian constitution.
The document contains text saying Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia.
It will be put to a referendum in Serbia on October 28th and 29th.
Also Thursday, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku told his French counterpart Philippe Douste-Blazy that Kosovo is fully prepared for independence.
Ceku, on a visit to Paris, said that the province has developed all necessary democratic institutions and is functioning in line with the international principles.
He requested that France -- a member of the Contact Group on Kosovo status talks -- defend the position of ethnic Albanians and help prevent any further delay in resolving the province's status.

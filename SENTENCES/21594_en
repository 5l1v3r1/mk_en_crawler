NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Nicosia will revise its position towards Turkey's EU prospects if Ankara changes its tactics in the Cypriot issue, Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou said on Thursday (August 21st). 
He added that resolving the long-standing dispute between the Greek and Cypriot communities on the divided island is one precondition the EU has set to allow Turkey to join its ranks. 
Turkey has refused to recognise the Republic of Cyprus, an EU member, and has been denying Cypriot vessels and aircraft entry to its ports and airports.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A court in the Austrian town of Korneuburg on Friday (March 4th) remanded Bosnian Army General Jovan Divjak to 14 days in custody pending extradition.
Divjak was detained on Thursday at the Vienna airport based on an arrest warrant issued by Serbia.
He is wanted in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.
His arrest triggered a protest in downtown Sarajevo where about 5,000 people gathered on Saturday to demand Divjak's immediate release.

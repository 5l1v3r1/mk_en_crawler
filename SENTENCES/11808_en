ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said on Wednesday (19 January) that Greece may have to delay compliance with the EU's 3 per cent budget deficit ceiling "If economic development slows down and is lower than what we have projected in the budget ...
then the reduction of the deficitâ¦ may have to be postponed for 2006," Alogoskoufis said.
The government expects the economy to grow by 3.9 per cent in 2005.
In other news, former Socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis told a local TV channel Wednesday that he will not make a bid to become leader of the main opposition party PASOK.
Last February, Simitis was succeeded as party chairman by George Papandreou.

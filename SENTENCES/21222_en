BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic on Friday (June 27th) gave incumbent Finance Minister Mirko Cvetkovic a mandate to form the country's new government after Tadic's pro-European coalition won the May 11th early elections.
Parliament is expected to vote on Cvetkovic's nomination this week.
Tadic announced his decision after a meeting of his Democratic Party's (DS) top leaders.
He said that a new majority has been formed in parliament, which includes the DS-led For a European Serbia coalition, the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS)-led coalition, the Muslim Sandzak and the Association of Hungarians in Vojvodina.
The prime minister nominee, who is member of the DS leadership, was finance minister in Vojislav Kostunica's government.
He has an economics degree and has worked in the World Bank structures in India and Pakistan.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Five people were injured when a bomb exploded in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Friday (June 15th). 
The time bomb was left at a bus stop on the busiest street in town, but apparently went off earlier than planned, when fewer people were on the street. 
Police suspect a group associated with the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party may be responsible.
On Friday meanwhile, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer called a referendum to decide whether voters or Parliament should elect his successor. 
He opposes an election by popular vote, as proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party.

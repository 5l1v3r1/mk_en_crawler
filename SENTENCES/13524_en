SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski voiced strong concern over the Kondovo case Wednesday (24 August), calling for full clarification.
A statement issued by his office said Crvenkovski wants relevant authorities to provide precise information about the latest developments, particularly media allegations that a local court lifted an arrest warrant against extremist leader Agim Krasniqi, whose heavily armed group has barred police from patrolling the village of Kondovo for months.
Crvenkovski warned "if this information proves true, it would mean complete neglect of the rule of law and violation of the constitution and Macedonia's laws." (Macedonian Government Web site - 25/08/05;

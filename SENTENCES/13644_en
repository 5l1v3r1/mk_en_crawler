IASI, Romania -- In their first bilateral meeting, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin and his Romanian counterpart Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu agreed Saturday (22 October) on the need for their countries to increase co-ordination of their efforts towards EU membership. 
The two ministers held talks in Iasi ahead of Tuesday's expected release of a European Commission (EC) progress report on the accession process of the two Balkan states.
On Friday, Reuters cited EC officials as saying the report would hold out the possibility of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU on 1 January 2007, as planned, provided they accelerate reforms. 
Membership in 2007 is "doable â¦ but very serious effort will be needed," Reuters quoted an unnamed official as saying. 
Corruption, an inadequate fight against organised crime, weak courts and ineffective administration, and lack of border control are among the "areas of serious concern" the EC will reportedly outline in the document.

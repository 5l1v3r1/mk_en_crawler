ZAGREB, Croatia -- A new forest fire broke out on Croatia's Hvar Island on Wednesday (13 August) and threatened to reach inhabited areas. 
About 100 firefighters and four aircraft were trying to save one of the country's top tourist attractions. 
Soaring temperatures and high winds were hampering efforts. 
Last month, a fire on Hvar consumed 1,500 hectares of pinewood and brush. 
In all, summer fires along the Adriatic coast have devastated 4,400 hectares of land.

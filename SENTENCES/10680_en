ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Wednesday (10 November) that he had called Greek counterpart Petros Molyviatis to discuss an incident in which Greek aircraft apparently followed two Turkish F-16s at very close range during a NATO-supervised military exercise.
Gul said he urged his "Greek friends" to avoid situations that raise tensions.
In other news, at least nine illegal immigrants drowned when their boat sank in the Aegean on Wednesday.
There might have been as many as 20 people from Somalia and Mauritania aboard the vessel.
Four survivors managed to swim to the Turkish coast.

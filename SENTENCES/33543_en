ATHENS, Greece -- Labour and Social Insurance Minister Dimitris Reppas announced on Monday (22 September) that the employment commission is amending the national employment action plan for 2003-2006.
The new strategy would focus on converting unemployment benefits into employment subsidies, hoping to stimulate private companies to increase the number of work places.
It is also aimed at improving the labour market's flexibility, curbing unofficial employment, and reducing discrimination in the recruitment of women.
Reppas added that the government would recruit 25,000 jobless persons for part-time work at the beginning of next year.

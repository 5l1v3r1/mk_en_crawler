BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic denounced on Thursday (May 27th) EULEX's decision to ban unauthorised visits by Serbian officials to Kosovo.
The decision targeted Serbian officials campaigning in the former province ahead of Sunday's unauthorised elections in northern Kosovo.
On Wednesday, Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic warned the ban could affect Serbian co-operation with EULEX.

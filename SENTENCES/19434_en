BUCHAREST, Romania -- Lawmakers approved on Tuesday (September 25th) a preliminary report which concludes that the restitution of the famous structure known as "Dracula's Castle" was illegal.
Last year, the key tourist attraction was returned to Archduke Dominic von Habsburg, heir of Romania's royal family, five decades after it was seized by the former communist regime.
The handover included an agreement under which the fortress would be kept as a museum for three years.
Tuesday's report, while not disputing the Habsburgs' right of ownership, said errors were made in the restitution procedure.
It said the castle should have been transferred to private ownership before being returned to its former owners.
Lawmakers also said four other heirs -- besides Dominic von Habsburg -- are eligible to inherit the property.

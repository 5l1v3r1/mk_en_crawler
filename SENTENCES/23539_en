ATHENS, Greece -- The farmers' protest that has blocked Greece's main roads and border checkpoints for more than ten days is over, Agriculture Minister Sotiris Hatzigakis announced on Thursday (January 29th).
"The farmers returned to their farms and houses and the biggest protest in the agricultural sector so far ended in the best possible way," Hatzigakis said.
The farmers had demanded higher state subsidies for the sector, among other things.

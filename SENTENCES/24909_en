PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Sunday (March 1st) that there was no place for smugglers in Serb-dominated northern Mitrovica and that the rule of law must command respect across the country. 
"Integration is the only way forward. 
The future of Mitrovica is the future of Kosovo," Thaci told Voice of America after meetings with top US officials last week. 
"This was the first visit by an official delegation of the Republic of Kosovo to the new US administration," Thaci said, adding he assured his hosts that Kosovo was a functional state in the process of building efficient, democratic and multiethnic institutions.
On Monday, the first trial in northern Mitrovica since Kosovo declared independence a year ago began. 
According to local media reports, EULEX judges will hear the case, involving an October 2007 robbery in the Leposavic region.
In other news, the International Steering Group (ISG) met in Vienna on Friday and welcomed all efforts by institutions in Kosovo to promote the rule of law and transparent governance. 
The ISG was assessing the progress made in Kosovo's development over the last three months and praised government efforts to strengthen judicial structures, especially in establishing constitutional courts. 
The group also welcomed the decision by International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith, who supported President Fatmir Sejdiu's proposal to skip general elections this year, allowing the government to complete its current mandate.

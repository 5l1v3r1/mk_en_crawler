THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte is disappointed that Serbia was invited to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme during the Riga summit Wednesday (November 29th), according to del Ponte spokesman Anton Nikiforov. 
Talking to Belgrade's B92 Radio later in the day, he said the tribunal was surprised that the invitation was extended to Serbia though it has not met its obligations in terms of war crimes co-operation.
Commenting on the same issue, Serbian President Boris Tadic said Wednesday that the admission to NATO's PfP programme did not mean that the problem of ICTY co-operation had been solved. 
He said Serbia must close this chapter and that all ICTY indictees must be arrested and brought to justice.

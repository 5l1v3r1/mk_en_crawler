LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- During a meeting in Ljubljana on Wednesday (April 8th), Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said Belgrade has no plans to apply for NATO membership. 
The issue was raised in light of neighbours Croatia and Albania joining the Alliance last week. 
Sutanovac told Slovenian counterpart Ljubica Jelusic that Serbia's parliament adopted a declaration of military neutrality in 2007 and there is no shift in that position. 
Serbia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace programme in 2006. 
He and Jelusic signed a defence and military co-operation agreement and discussed specific forms of potential co-operation.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Mayor Stefan Sofianski was charged on Friday (9 July) with procedural discrepancies in a deal to build a business centre in Sofia.
This is the third time he has been charged with violating the best interests of Sofia in large-scale business deals involving municipal property.
If convicted, Sofianski faces an eight-year prison sentence.
He was just reinstated as mayor on Wednesday after being cleared of charges stemming from the 1998 sale of a downtown shopping mall.
Prosecutors have appealed that reinstatement.

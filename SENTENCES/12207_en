SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Presidency member Sulejman Tihic and BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Adnan Terzic, who are also the respective chairman and deputy chairman of the main Bosniak party, SDA, met with party representatives in the RS National Assembly on Thursday (13 January) to discuss the latest developments in the Serb entity. 
RS President Dragan Cavic has said that no Bosniak party will be invited to join the new cabinet. 
The SDA leaders say that the situation in RS is being radicalised and that the Serb parties' unwillingness to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal is damaging the country's efforts to join Euro-Atlantic structures.
In other news Thursday, the outgoing RS government appointed an eight-member taskforce to implement the conclusions of the Srebrenica Commission's final report. 
The workgroup must identify those whose names appear in confidential parts of the report and who remain on the government payroll.

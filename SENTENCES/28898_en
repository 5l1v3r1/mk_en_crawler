PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX and Kosovo Police have boosted their presence in the northern Serb-dominated part of Mitrovica following an incident that left four Albanian youth hospitalised.
The four, between the ages of 17 and 21, say they were attacked on Wednesday (June 9th) by a group wielding metal bars.
Kosovo Police announced the arrest of five Serbs, two of whom have since been released, according to Belgrade-based media.
EULEX says an investigation is under way.
In other news, Pristina media reported on Friday that a Serbian policeman has "escaped" from Kosovo Police.
Dragisa Antic was spotted on Thursday evening in northern Mitrovica, but ran off when police ordered him to stop.
They say they found papers, including a Serbian Police identity card and a card indicating membership in the Serbian Radical Party.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The anti-corruption office, USKOK, charged former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic and former assistant Ivo Bacic with abuse of power Wednesday (October 28th) over a 2004 procurement deal involving military trucks.
According to prosecutors, the contract cost the state millions of kunas.
Earlier this month, colleagues in parliament voted to strip Roncevic of his immunity as a lawmaker.
He is a member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union.

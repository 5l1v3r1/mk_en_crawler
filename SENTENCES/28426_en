BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Belgrade court on Wednesday (June 16th) acquitted six anarchists charged with causing general danger by attacking the Greek Embassy in the capital. 
The judge said that accusations were not proved. 
Initially, the six were charged with international terrorism, before prosecutors amended the indictment. 
The defendants had spent six months in custody for the August 2009 Molotov cocktail attack on the embassy.

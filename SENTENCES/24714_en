ATHENS, Greece -- A far-left group calling itself Armed Revolutionary Action claimed responsibility Friday (June 5th) for the bombing of a tax office in the northern Athens suburb of Psychico, media reported. 
The explosion outside the office early Friday caused property damage but no injuries. 
About ten minutes earlier, an anonymous caller phoned in a warning to the daily Eleftherotypia.

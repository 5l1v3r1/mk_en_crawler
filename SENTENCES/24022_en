BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities have launched an operation to relocate about 25 brown bears at the Sinaia Mountain resort, in an effort to ensure tourists are safe. 
Sinaia Mayor Vlad Oprea announced on Wednesday (June 17th) that several bears have already been moved to forests in the Arges region, about 100km west. 
Increasingly, bears in the Carpathian Mountains are heading down to towns looking for food. 
Tourists have been snapping photos of them and in some cases, even offering them food, which has led to scattered attacks over the years.

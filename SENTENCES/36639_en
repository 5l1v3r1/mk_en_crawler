SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer congratulated Branko Crvenkovski on Sunday (2 May) on his victory in last week's presidential run-off.
Scheffer also expressed satisfaction with the progress of the army's reform and modernisation plan.
Meanwhile, the opposition VMRO-DPMNE party continues to dispute the election returns and is now threatening to bring in independent experts from the EU and the United States to verify the results.
VMRO-DPMNE has filed dozens of complaints with the State Electoral Commission, claiming irregularities led to the defeat of its candidate, Sasko Kedev.

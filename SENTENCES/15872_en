ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis urged an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East on Wednesday (19 July).
He condemned the escalation of violence, appealed for the release of Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah militants, and called for the disarmament of paramilitary organisations and the full, speedy restoration of the Lebanese government's sovereignty throughout the country's territory.
Karamanlis also appealed for joint international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Lebanon and to protect unarmed civilians who wish to leave.
A Greek military ship has already evacuated 600 foreign nationals from Beirut.
Another Greek ship, Kriti II, hired by the Swedish government, has left the Lebanese port for Cyprus with 500 people of Greek, Scandinavian, French and British nationality.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic announced on Friday (January 28th) he has decided to resign after nine years at the post.
Milosavljevic said the reasons behind the move are "deeply personal", adding that from now on he will dedicate his time to his work as a doctor and professor.
He did not take questions from reporters after his announcement.
Milosavljevic is a senior official in the G17 Plus party, a government coalition partner, but was not re-elected during party elections in last May.
He has served in five governments under four prime ministers.

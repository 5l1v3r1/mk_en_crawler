BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraqi militant group "Brigades of the Lions of Righteousness" said Saturday (26 August) that it kidnapped a Turkish worker, who, according to a militant web site has been identified as Yildirim Tek of Istanbul. 
Tek is employed by Ankara-based construction company Vinsan. 
The kidnappers demanded that the firm close, and asked Ankara to sever all ties with the Iraqi government. 
There was no immediate comment from the Turkish government.
In other news, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer on Friday denounced his country's plan to join the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon. 
Sezar stated that he disagreed with the proposed rules of engagement for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and that he believes Turkey should confine itself solely to humanitarian assistance. 
Sezer stressed that Turkey has its own security problems in its fight against the Kurdistan Workers' Party, and that participation in UNIFIL would be ill-timed.

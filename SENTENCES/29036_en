ATHENS, Greece -- Several thousand civil servants gathered in Athens on Thursday (October 7th) to protest austerity measures as part of a 24-hour strike by the public sector.
The demonstrators marched to the parliament without incident.
Their walk-out affected air traffic, as airspace was closed for four hours during the afternoon.
Media in neighbouring Tirana reported border crossings with Greece were closed during the day, leaving hundreds of travellers stranded.
The only way people were able to cross was on foot.
A series of strikes in Greece have had a direct effect on the Albanian customs sector and the amount of revenue it has been able to collect.

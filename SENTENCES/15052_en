SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Parliament's House of Representatives Friday (30 September) passed on second reading the two key laws related to the restructuring of the BiH defence sector -- on defence and on service in the BiH armed forces.
The legislation is considered crucial for the establishment of a single chain of command and a single, professional army in the country starting in 2006.
The BiH House of Peoples is also expected to endorse the two laws on Wednesday.
NATO's HQ Commander in BiH, US Brigadier General Louis W. Weber welcomed the parliamentary vote.
He said the Alliance would continue assisting the implementation of defence reforms in BiH, including support for the social re-integration of laid-off soldiers.

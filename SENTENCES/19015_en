SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Environmental groups launched protests Monday (July 2nd) in Sofia against a ruling by the High Administrative Court, which abolished the natural park status of Strandzha Mountain, clearing the way for construction there. 
Police detained more than 30 people who blocked a central juncture in Sofia and caused traffic problems. 
Last Friday, the top court invalidated a 1995 decision by the Ministry of Environment and Waters that made Strandzha a natural park and protected territory. 
The judges cited administrative shortcomings.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Over 25,000 Turkish Cypriots joined a rally Wednesday (March 2nd) in the northern part of Nicosia against austerity measures supported by Turkey. 
This was the second such protest in a month and is believed to be the biggest ever held in the Turkish-dominated part of the divided island.

ATHENS, Greece -- An Airbus A320 belonging to the Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling was held up for several hours Thursday (August 6th) at the airport in Athens after a terrorist threat.
The plane, with 155 people aboard, was scheduled to take off at 3.30 pm and land in Barcelona at 6.00 pm.
It eventually departed at 7.00 pm, after a thorough search.
No bomb was found.
Vueling made headlines Wednesday when an engine caught fire aboard one of its planes taxiing for take-off in Paris.
Eight people were hurt while evacuating the plane.

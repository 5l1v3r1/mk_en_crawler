NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos invited Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to hold new talks aimed at reunification of the ethnically-divided island, the government in Nicosia said Monday (July 9th).
Papadopoulos suggested that he and Talat meet to discuss the implementation of the so-called July 8th accord, which envisages restarting negotiations.
The Turkish Cypriots confirmed that they received the invitation, but have not yet responded.

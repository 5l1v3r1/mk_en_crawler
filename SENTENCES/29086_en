SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov and Alexander Medvedev, vice president of Gazprom, arrive in Sofia on Tuesday (July 6th) for negotiations with the Bulgarian government on big bilateral energy projects, as well as new natural gas delivery contracts. 
In particular, they will discuss the future of the second nuclear plant in Belene, and the South Stream natural gas pipeline. 
The Bulgarian cabinet maintains that construction at Belene should continue only after a strategic European investor joins the project. 
As for South Stream, the project is part of the cabinet's long-term energy plans, but is less of a priority than Nabucco, which will carry natural gas from Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iraq, providing an alternative to Russian supplies. 
Still subject to negotiations is the capacity of the pipeline. 
Gazprom has said it wants to double it to 63 billion cubic metres per year.

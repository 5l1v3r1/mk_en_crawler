ATHENS, Greece -- Farmers ended their blockade of the bridge connecting the Peloponnese peninsula and Corinth late Tuesday (January 27th), restoring one of Greece's most important road links. 
But the massive protest by farmers entered a tenth day Wednesday, halting traffic on main highways across the country and at crossings at borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia and Turkey. 
The farmers are demanding higher subsidies, better pensions, guaranteed minimum prices for their products, a reduced refundable VAT and lower fuel prices.
Meanwhile, air traffic controllers launched a 24-hour strike Wednesday in a show of solidarity with the farmers, despite a court ruling that declared the walkout illegal. 
Airports cancelled dozens of international flights Wednesday morning, though domestic flights operated normally.
In other news, police arrested 25 people Tuesday, including a priest, two doctors and an army officer, for allegedly downloading child pornography. 
The arrests followed a co-ordinated police operation in seven major cities, including Athens, Thessaloniki and Patras. 
Police said they acted on a tip from Interpol.

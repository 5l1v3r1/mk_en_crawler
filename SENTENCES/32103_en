TIRANA, Albania -- Doris Pack, chairwoman of the Parliamentary Delegation for Southeast Europe, participated in a parliamentary conference in Tirana on Tuesday (15 October). 
The topic of the conference was strengthening security and political security through economic co-operation. 
Pack noted that, two weeks ago, the Foreign Affairs and Human Rights Committee of the European Parliament presented a report on the association and stabilisation process for five Southeast European countries not included in the EU membership process. 
The report recommends that the EU suspend financial aid to these countries if they do not fulfil the following political criteria: effective co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, implementation of policy for the return of refugees and displaced people, an active policy against organised crime and corruption, and reforms in the judiciary.

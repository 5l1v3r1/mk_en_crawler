ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged voters on Tuesday (October 2nd) to support the constitutional amendments proposed by his ruling Justice and Development Party. 
"I believe that the election of president by popular vote will be the best model for direct democracy," Erdogan said on Tuesday. 
The changes will be put before the electorate at a referendum on October 21st.
Until now, parliament has picked the president. 
Other changes include reducing the president's term from seven years to five, allowing the president to seek re-election, holding general elections every four years instead of five, and reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions.

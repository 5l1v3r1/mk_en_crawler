ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Speaking on the sidelines of a two-day meeting of the Southeast European Co-operation Process in Istanbul on Tuesday (June 22nd), Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu urged all countries confronting terrorists to join forces and act in solidarity.
He also noted that Ankara has talked to officials in Iraq and regional officials in its north about border co-operation.
"We need them to work with us to remove the threat of terrorism," Davutoglu said after meeting with Bosnian counterpart Sven Alkalaj and Serbia's Vuk Jeremic.
Davutoglu urged the EU and NATO to leave their doors open to all Balkan countries, describing the two organisations as the engines of political and economic progress in the region.
These trilateral meetings among Turkey, Serbia and Bosnia began last year.

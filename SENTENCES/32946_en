ANKARA, Turkey -- Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters on Tuesday (27 May) that recovery teams have found the flight data recorders of the Ukrainian YAK-42 aircraft which crashed Monday near Trabzon, killing all 75 people aboard.
The dead include 62 Spanish peacekeepers, who were heading home from duty in Afghanistan.
The recorders are expected to show why the aircraft went down in heavy fog on its third landing attempt.
Spain sent two aircraft to take the bodies home.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has sent condolences to the victims' families.

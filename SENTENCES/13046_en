ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish government will try to help Iraq put an end to the recent surge in sectarian violence, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday (26 February).
He told the ruling Justice and Development Party that Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari plans to visit Ankara on Tuesday, while Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr -- whose Mehdi militia has been involved in violence against Sunnis -- plans a separate visit.
In other news Sunday, local media reported that Turkey has ratified Protocol No.13 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which bans the death penalty in all cases.
Ankara signed the protocol two years ago.

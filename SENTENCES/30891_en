BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Admission of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area, originally planned for the end of March, will be delayed until October at the earliest, Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter said on Thursday (January 6th). 
He explained that the two countries still have a number of criteria they have to meet before they can be granted entry into the border-free zone. 
The criteria in question will likely become clearer by June.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Voters who plan to participate in the November 15th municipal elections are not getting the information they need from the Central Election Commission, the NGO coalition Democracy in Action warned on Wednesday (October 28th). 
The coalition also noted a series of violations since campaigning began two weeks ago, including posters being ripped down, official vehicles being used for campaigning, officials participating in election activities during work hours and using public areas for campaigning. 
The coalition of NGOs was appointed to monitor the upcoming elections.

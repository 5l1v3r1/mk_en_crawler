WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell announced on Monday (31 March) that he will travel to Turkey, the first of several trips he intends to make around the world to discuss the future of Iraq.
During Wednesday's visit, he says he would try to persuade the Turkish leaders that "it is unnecessary for them to consider any incursions" into northern Iraq.
He is expected to ask Ankara to allow US aircraft to make refueling stops in Turkey.Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, are considering a proposal by President George W Bush for $1 billion dollars in aid to Turkey.

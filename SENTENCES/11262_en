TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu said Thursday (23 June) that the Western Balkans should be more committed to joint development. 
During a two-day conference in Tirana on millennium development goals, Moisiu acknowledged the region's dramatic past and said even now, one fifth of its inhabitants live in poverty. 
He urged for all governments to collaborate and assist each other in the path towards the Euro-Atlantic integration, which would reduce poverty and boost employment. 
Representatives from Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro attended the conference, which was organised by the UNDP and European Commission.

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) says the failure of a European Parliament (EP) initiative to resolve the political crisis in Albania puts the responsibility squarely in the hands of the two main political parties -- the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party. 
Angela Filote, spokeswoman for EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, said on Thursday (June 17th) "A solution is necessary for the citizens of Albania, who aspire to become European citizens." On Wednesday, EP officials acknowledged that despite their help, Albanian leaders still wrangle over the transparency of the June 2009 general elections. 
The stalemate has delayed EU-related reforms.

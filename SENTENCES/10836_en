BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria is determined to accelerate constitutional changes that would lead to judicial reforms, Justice Minister Anton Stankov told EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen during a meeting Thursday (2 September).
His statement followed one by Verheugen, who urged Bulgarian EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva to intensify judicial reform and the fight against organised crime.
Stankov said efforts would be made to transfer investigative powers from the judiciary to law enforcement.

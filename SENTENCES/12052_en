SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva warned on Monday (16 May) that delaying EU entry by a year might cost up to 800m euros.
Such losses would result from activation of the so-called safeguard clause included in the EU Accession Treaty signed by Bulgaria and Romania.
Kuneva added that any delay beyond 2007 would increase the potential losses for Bulgaria, as the gap between the country and EU members would expand.

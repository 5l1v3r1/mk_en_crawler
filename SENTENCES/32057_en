BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Local media is reporting that the Montenegrin side has accepted in principle a compromise solution on electing members of the future federation's parliament. 
Press reports suggest that Montenegro softened its position during Tuesday's (19 November) meeting of the commission responsible for coming up with a constitutional charter. 
Sources say the parties discussed four options for electing the new legislature. 
Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists reportedly approved a proposal by Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's Democratic Party. 
It calls for electing the constituency assembly through republican commissions, followed by direct elections for future parliaments.

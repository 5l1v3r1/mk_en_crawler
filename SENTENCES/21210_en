BUCAREST, Romania -- Authorities issued an alert Sunday (June 29th) at Romania's nuclear power station Cernavoda, following a hydrochloric acid leak in a parking area.
Employees neutralised the acid and sealed the leak.
An official described it as a minor incident that posed no threat to plant security.
In other news, two people died on Saturday and another was hospitalised after spending more than seven hours trapped in an old gold mine in the western county of Hunedoara.
Police say the three entered the restricted mine to steal scrap iron.

WASHINGTON, United States -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (June 4th) the EU should not give up plans for further enlargement in the Balkans.
"There is a certain degree of enlargement fatigue which has spread through Europe in recent years.
...
However, it is important to understand that enlargement must not be the scapegoat of the economic recession," he told the Reuters news agency.
Rehn was in Washington, meeting with US State Department and World Bank officials to discuss a range of issues, including Turkey.
Regarding Ankara's EU accession process, he said Turkey has "a lot of work to do" in terms of freedom of expression and media.
Turkey must speed up pro-EU reforms to keep its bid on track, Rehn noted.
On Friday, Turkey criticised European parties campaigning against its EU membership bid ahead of the European Parliament elections.
The foreign ministry issued a statement saying "Turkey rejects such rhetoric, which has nothing to do with good will and only fuels xenophobia." (Reuters, Hurriyet, NTV, Tanjug, B92, AFP - 05/06/09)

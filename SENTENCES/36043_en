THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced Thursday (25 March) that it would consider "in the interest of justice" whether Slobodan Milosevic's trial should continue, following the resignation of Presiding Judge Richard May.
Milosevic was summoned to the court and asked whether he agreed with the appointment of Patrick Robinson as May's replacement.
Robinson is one of the three judges hearing the case against the former Yugoslav President.
Milosevic refused to answer the question and instead asked to be released.
The court must now decide between a retrial and continuation of the case.
Judge May's resignation for health reasons takes effect on 31 May.

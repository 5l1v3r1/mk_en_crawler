NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders ended the first round of talks on the reunification of Cyprus on Monday (22 March), acknowledging they failed to make significant progress. 
The second round of negotiations begins in Switzerland on Wednesday with the prime ministers of Greece and Turkey participating. 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to take part in the talks towards the end of the week. 
The two sides have failed to agree on territorial and property claims and security arrangements. 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash is insisting on limits to the number of Greek Cypriots who can settle in the north of Cyprus, a demand which runs counter to EU rules on the free movement of people. 
Denktash says he will not travel to Switzerland; Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat will represent the Turkish Cypriots instead.

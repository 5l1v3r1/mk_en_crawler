BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU plans to offer Turkey an accession road map, Hurriyet reported on Friday (22 November).
According to the newspaper, the European Council of Ministers will draft the road map at its December session in Copenhagen, but will not set a date for starting accession talks until after a six-month monitoring period.
That would coincide with the European Council's June meeting in Thessaloniki, when Greece will preside over the EU.
Justice and Development Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Greece earlier this week where Prime Minister Costas Simitis pledged to support Turkey's EU membership bid.
In other news, the government announced Thursday that state TV and radio networks will begin broadcasting in Kurdish.
The decision is in line with EU requirements that every ethnic minority in the country be represented in national transmissions.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Parliament (EP) rapporteur for Croatia, Hannes Swoboda, said on Friday (September 26th) that if everything goes according to plan, Croatia will be able to complete its EU accession talks by the end of 2009 and join the bloc in 2011.
Speaking in Zadar at a two-day conference on various Southeast European countries' EU prospects, Swoboda said that the completion of the EU accession talks depends both on the government in Zagreb and on the EU and added that Croatia should do more to fight corruption and reform its judiciary.

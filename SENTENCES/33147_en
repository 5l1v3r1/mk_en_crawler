ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday (17 May) that his country would lift entry restrictions for Greek Cypriots.
Starting Thursday, residents of the Greek part of the divided island will not need visas to enter Turkey.
He called on Greece to adopt similar measures for Turkish Cypriots.
Erdogan said the measure was designed to boost confidence further, following the lifting of travel restrictions between the two parts of the island in April.
Rauf Denktash, president of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", said Turkey's decision was timely and appropriate.

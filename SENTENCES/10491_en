LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- During a joint news conference Wednesday (17 November) with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said Luxembourg is in favour of setting a date for the launch of accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU by June 2005 at the latest. 
He added, however, that it is more realistic to expect the date will be set during the second half of the year. 
Luxembourg assumes the rotating EU presidency in January.

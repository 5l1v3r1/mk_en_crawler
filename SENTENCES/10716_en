SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana visited Skopje on Tuesday (9 November), two days after the failed referendum on Macedonia's new decentralisation laws. 
After meeting with President Branko Crvenkovski, Solana told reporters that Macedonia is firmly on the path of European integration. 
The referendum showed that most Macedonians want to look to the future rather than the past, Solana said. 
He also paid a short visit to Athens.
In other news, Greece has cancelled the signing of a labour agreement with Macedonia that was scheduled for next week. 
Labour Minister Panos Panayiotopoulos said the decision was tied to US recognition of the country's constitutional name.

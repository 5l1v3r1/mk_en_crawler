SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Berlin-based NGO Transparency International announced on Friday (July 11th) that it is temporarily closing its office and withdrawing its staff from BiH for security reasons. 
"It is one of the few times in Transparency International's history that a national chapter has been intimidated to the point of having to suspend operations," Managing Director Cobus de Swardt said. 
He alleged that the organisation had come under pressure after Republika Sprska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik accused TI employees of involvement in blackmail and organised crime.
TI angered RS officials after last year it criticised the lack of transparency in some privatisations and concession deals in the Bosnian Serb entity and demanded declassification of all information related to them.

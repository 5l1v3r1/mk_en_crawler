SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Justice Minister Georgi Petkanov annouced on Wednesday (May 30th) that he is stepping down due to health issues. 
He made the announcement after a session of the Supreme Judicial Council, but declined to say when exactly he would leave the cabinet. 
He did indicate however that cabinet changes are imminent.
The European Commission denied on Tuesday that it has pressed Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev to fire some of his ministers in light of an ongoing corruption scandal. 
It has already resulted in the dismissal of two deputy ministers and the suspension of Deputy Prime Minister Rumen Ovcharov.

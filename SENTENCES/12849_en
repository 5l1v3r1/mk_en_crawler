BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic told reporters Wednesday (1 December) that the alleged assassination attempt against Serbian President Boris Tadic was actually a case of road rage.
Jocic said the US Embassy in Belgrade has informed him that one of its employees, security guard Miroslav Cimpl, accidentally hit a car in Tadic's motorcade and has now turned himself into police.
"He had never experienced that kind of driving;
he got very aggravated and started manoeuvring with his car.
When he spotted the blue police lights, he got scared, and that's how the events we described today took place," Jocic explained.

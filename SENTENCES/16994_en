SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Voters will go to the polls Wednesday (5 July) in an election that could have a major impact on its ambitions to join the EU and NATO.
The election campaign has been marred by shootings and other incidents, prompting stern warnings from both international alliances.
EU envoy Erwan Fouere said Macedonia's general election was "a crucial test for the capacity of the country to demonstrate its political maturity and to show it is a serious candidate for joining the EU".
While Skopje has been granted the formal status of a candidate, the EU has not yet scheduled a date for beginning accession talks.

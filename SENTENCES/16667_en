BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday (7 September) backed the planned reduction of the international community's role in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and the transfer of more responsibilities to BiH institutions.
It is high time for the country "to get on its feet", she said during a meeting with visiting BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.
They also discussed the 1 October general elections in BiH, the reform processes, and the requirements BiH must meet to seal the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Merkel assured Ivanic that the Western Balkans would remain one of Germany's top priorities.

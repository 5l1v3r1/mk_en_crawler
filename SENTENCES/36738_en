TIRANA, Albania -- Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has confirmed his country's support for Albania's bid to join the EU. 
Meeting with Albanian counterpart Kastriot Islami and Prime Minister Fatos Nano in Tirana on Friday (23 July), Bot emphasised that the integration of Albania and other Western Balkan countries into Euro-Atlantic structures is a priority for the Netherlands. 
He said considerable progress to that end has been achieved in recent years, adding it is crucial that Albania and neighbouring states demonstrate the necessary political will for reforms.

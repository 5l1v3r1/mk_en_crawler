PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Italian Ambassador to Kosovo Michael Giffoni does not rule out the possibility of co-operation between the EU presence in the north and Serbs representing parallel structures there. 
In an interview with the Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore on Monday (March 29th), Giffoni said he will implement an EU plan aimed at improving the quality of life in the Serb-dominated region. 
The Italian diplomat, who has taken over the role of EU facilitator in the north, said the Union is only trying to establish institutional authority there. 
Meanwhile, Kosovo institutions, in co-operation with the International Civilian Office, are preparing a strategy to establish Pristina's control in the north.

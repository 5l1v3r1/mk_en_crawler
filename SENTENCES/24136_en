TIRANA, Albania -- An ongoing investigation into last year's deadly ammunition blasts in Gerdec has revealed the name of the company that was running the dismantling depot, investigators said on Tuesday (April 14th).
Running Trans Digging Construction were businessman Mihal Delijorgji, the main suspect in the Gerdec case, and Fahri Balliu, a close aide to Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
Balliu registered his 20% share in the company under his daughter's name, investigators determined.
The defence ministry and the army are investigating the explosions, which killed 26 people and injured 300 others in March 2008.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS)-led For a European Belgrade coalition, which includes the Serbian Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, reached a power-sharing agreement Saturday (August 16th) regarding the Belgrade city council. 
The accord focuses on economic aspects of city management, particularly depoliticising city government. 
The parties continued talks on the last remaining details, and assuming all goes smoothly, the first Belgrade Assembly session could occur on Tuesday. 
The members' first task will be to elect a mayor, a deputy mayor and members of the city council. 
DS whip Dragan Dilas is the most likely candidate for mayor.

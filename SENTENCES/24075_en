NEW YORK, United States -- The UN on Wednesday (April 15th) urged the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus in Cyprus to take advantage of the momentum provided by ongoing reunification talks.
"They really have to succeed, because I think the alternative is a fairly dark future for Cyprus," UN special envoy Alexander Downer told Reuters.
He added that the two communities are making "steady progress" but refused to speculate on any time frame for ending the talks.
"It would be a mistake to set actual deadlines," Downer said, adding however, "Dragging things for an unspecified time means death." (Reuters, Hurriyet, Famagusta Gazette - 15/04/09)

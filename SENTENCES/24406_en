ATHENS, Greece -- At least 14 people were injured Saturday (May 9th) in clashes between police, neo-Nazi protesters and immigrants in Athens, media reported. 
Violence erupted after a group of about 300 members of the neo-Nazi group Chrysi Avgi (Golden Dawn) gathered in central Athens for an anti-immigrant protest. 
They threw rocks at an old courthouse housing illegal immigrants awaiting expulsion. 
Left-wing and immigrants' rights groups staged a counter-demonstration but riot police managed to keep them from clashing with the far-right protesters. 
Nine policemen and five immigrants were injured when it was all over.

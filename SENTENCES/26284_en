BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's army should be fully professionalised by 2011, President Boris Tadic said in an interview with army magazine Odbrana on Saturday (February 13th). 
Serbian Army and Statehood Day is February 15th. 
"I believe that we will achieve this goal," Tadic, who is also the chief commander of the country's armed forces, stated. 
He vowed to continue reforms despite the economic crisis in order to turn the army into an institution that meets international standards.

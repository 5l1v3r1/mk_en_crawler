Registering a business in Macedonia takes an average of 48 days, according to studies by the World Bank.
That is expected to change after a new, streamlined registration system -- part of a larger package of economic reforms put forward by the government -- goes into provisional operation on 1 September.
Under the "One-Stop Shop" system, announced by the government earlier this year, firms in Macedonia will be able to register at one location for a fee of 33 euros -- a fraction of the current 250 euros.
"Introducing this system is only a small rock in the mosaic called improvement of the business climate," Deputy Prime Minister Minco Jordanov says.
In addition to facilitating registration and lowering its cost, the system will also establish a quality database, the minister notes.
"I hope that as of 1 September we will deny all those who say a one-stop-shop system could not possibly function in Macedonia," says Central Registry Director Nake Stojanovski.
According to him, the system is necessary because the accuracy of the current partial database -- which consists of information received from various sources -- is dubious.
Although it will be launched in the fall, the system won't be fully operational until early next year.
Amendments to 16 laws, including the Law on Companies adopted last year, will need to be made.
Two by-laws and a separate single-counter system law must also be adopted.
The first step will be to complete the digitised recording of companies in the Central Registry.
Out of 97,000 companies currently registered in Macedonia, information on half of them -- around 50,000 companies -- already has been converted to digitised registry folders.
After the e-filing process is completed, the firms will confirm the accuracy of the data.
Implementation of the system will cost around 1.2m euros, and is being funded by the UNDP, USAID and European Agency for Development.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith said on Tuesday (February 9th) that the strategy for Serb-dominated northern Kosovo will be forwarded to Belgrade authorities, though not for consultation.
Austrian news agency APA reports that Feith expects it will take time for Serbia to accept it the strategy, which has the EU's backing.
The strategy seeks to put the north under the control of Kosovo institutions, rather than Belgrade-backed parallel structures.

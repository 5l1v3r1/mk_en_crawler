WASHINGTON, United States -- The US administration wants to speed up the resolution of Kosovo's final status and sees 2005 as the "year of decision," Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns told Congress Wednesday (18 May). 
Keeping Kosovo's future undecided was "not sustainable or desirable", he said. 
"We, and our allies, are entering a new stage in our policy towards the Balkans, one that will accelerate the region's integration into the European family and Euro-Atlantic institutions," Burns said, adding that US forces would remain in the province "until the job is done".
Also Wednesday, international media carried unconfirmed reports that Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has written to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and expressed confidence that Ratko Mladic would be arrested and transferred to The Hague before 11 July, the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.
In other news, Kosovo's Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi and President Ibrahim Rugova are prepared to meet with their Serbian counterparts Vojislav Kostunica and Boris Tadic, according to releases from their offices Wednesday. 
Kosumi repeated that the date and place of Kostunica's proposed meeting should be changed. 
A spokesman for Rugova said the Kosovo president would convene with Tadic during an international conference in Geneva next month.

ANKARA, Turkey -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (14 July) that he sees no reason to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey. 
Despite some recent negative developments related to freedom of speech and expression, the reform process in Turkey generally has been revived, proving the country's loyalty to its commitments, Rehn told the Finnish news agency STT. 
He reiterated, however, that Ankara must accelerate implementation of set reforms, strengthen the rule of law and commit itself to resolving the Cyprus issue.

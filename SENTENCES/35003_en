SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Political will is a key factor in determining the fate of those missing since the 2001 military conflict, says Jeffrey Binger, chief of the International Commission for Missing Persons in Macedonia.
In an interview for Radio Free Europe on Sunday (7 December), Binger said the government should not just hope the problem would disappear itself but should show the will to find out what happened to these people.
He also urged President Boris Trajkovski to form a state-level body, to co-ordinate work on the cases.
Twelve Macedonian civilians are missing, along with six ethnic Albanian civilians.
In other news, Trajovski met on Friday with the heads of the customs administrations of Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro to discuss the re-opening of a transit corridor via Kosovo.
Transit has been suspended since the Kosovo crisis in 1999.

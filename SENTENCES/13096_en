BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government on Friday (28 October) approved a cost-cutting 2006 budget that it said would meet conditions set by the IMF.
Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said the $6.9 billion draft budget reduces spending for health services, cuts subsidies to state-run companies and lowers salaries in the government administration and public services.
The IMF had threatened to withhold further loans to Serbia if its conditions were not met.
This would have also voided Serbia's agreement with the Paris Club of creditors, under which Belgrade's debt was cut substantially.
In other news, Serbian's Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica began a two-day visit to Greece on Monday.
Talks are expected to focus on bilateral ties, upcoming talks on Kosovo's final status and regional developments.

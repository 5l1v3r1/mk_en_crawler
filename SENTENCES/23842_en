SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Tuesday (July 21st) that the double formula -- "one name for communication with Greece, while the constitutional name to be valid for all other countries" -- is Macedonia's position in the longstanding name dispute.
In an interview with Forum magazine, Gruevski said Greece's proposal is for Macedonia's constitutional name be changed to Republic of Northern Macedonia, for use both internationally and domestically.
He stressed, however, that Skopje wants to resolve the matter.
"We want to become members of NATO and the EU, and we don't want to be blocked.
We don't want to have a problem with our southern neighbour [Greece]." (Makfax, MIA - 22/07/09)

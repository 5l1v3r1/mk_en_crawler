THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch public prosecutors say their investigation into the death of Slobodan Milosevic showed that he died naturally of a heart attack.
"There is not a single indication that the death was the result of foul play," prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday (5 April).
The former Yugoslav leader, on trial for war crimes, was found dead in his cell in The Hague on 11 March.
Earlier autopsy results also showed a heart attack as the cause of death.
Those findings have been confirmed by investigators with the National Forensic Institute, Wednesday's statement noted.
Milosevic supporters had been claiming he was poisoned.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The outspoken chief secretary of the interior ministry tendered his resignation on Friday (25 April) during a meeting with Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg.
Boyko Borisov's flamboyant style made him the most popular figure in the country.
He did not reveal the reasons for his resignation, but it is speculated that he may have been forced out after he made public comments about alleged ties between politicians and the underworld.
His remarks were prompted by a car bombing a week ago in Sofia, which targeted a businessman with alleged underworld links.
Saxe-Coburg is to decide whether to accept Borisov's resignation by Tuesday.

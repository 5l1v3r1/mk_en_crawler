SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leading Bosniak politicians demanded on Monday (March 12th) that Srebrenica -- a city where genocide against Bosniaks was committed in 1995, according to the recent ruling of International Court of Justice in The Hague -- should receive the status of a district.
Srebrenica Mayor Abdurahman Malkic organised the meeting after Bosniaks threatened to leave the city. 
Meeting participants, including the Bosniak and Croat members of the country's tripartite presidency, Haris Silajdzic and Zeljko Komsic, insisted Srebrenica should be under state jurisdiction, rather than that of the entity, Republika Srpska. 
Neither international community representatives nor Serb politicians took part in Monday's meeting. 
RS President Milan Jelic and RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said it violated the Dayton Peace Agreement.

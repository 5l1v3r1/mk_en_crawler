SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Justice Minister Barisa Colak approved on Wednesday (February 24th) the extradition of Serb Bojan Guduric to Croatia, where he is wanted in connection with the murder of prominent Croatian publisher and journalist Ivo Pukanic.
A week ago, the BiH Court decided that Guduric should be handed over to Zagreb.
He turned himself in to police in Banja Luka on February 1st.
Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional, died in a car bombing in downtown Zagreb on October 23rd 2008, along with the newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic.
Four other suspects in the case are on trial in Croatia.
On a related note, the trial of Serb underworld boss Sreten Jocic and members of his group over Pukanic's murder will start on April 20th at the Belgrade's Special Court for Organised Crime, media reported on Wednesday.
Prosecutors say Jocic masterminded the murder, striking a deal with "an unidentified for the time being person" to kill the journalist for 1.5m euros.

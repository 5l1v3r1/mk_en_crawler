BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (PSD), threatened on Thursday (March 22nd) to hold a no confidence vote unless Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu restructures his cabinet within days. 
PSD leader Mircea Geoana said he would be willing to support a new cabinet. 
The opposition Conservative Party (PC) agrees, saying that -- along with President Traian Basescu's resignation -- would resolve the current crisis. 
But Basescu's ruling Democratic Party accused fellow coalition member, the Liberal Party, of negotiating with the PSD and PC without consulting its partners.

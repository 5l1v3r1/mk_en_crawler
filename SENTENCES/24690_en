BELGRADE, Serbia -- Recognising Kosovo's independence and joining NATO are not preconditions for Serbia's EU accession, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac told the Vecernje Novosti newspaper on Sunday (June 7th).
He added that he was assured of this "during conversations with people holding the highest possible positions" in the bloc and the Alliance.
According to him, Serbia's highest priority is EU integration.

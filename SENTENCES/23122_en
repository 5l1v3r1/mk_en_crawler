TIRANA, Albania -- A delegation of prosecutors from the UN war crimes tribunal is expected to visit Albania shortly to investigate allegations hundreds of captured Serbs and Romas were murdered for their bodily organs, according to media reports Thursday (October 2nd).
Former chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte levelled the allegation in her book "The Hunt".
She says the murders and organ removals occurred during the Kosovo conflict in the northern Albanian village of Gur.
The Hague tribunal says the Council of Europe has already formed a committee and a team of investigators to handle with the case.
Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha and others insist the claims are "groundless".

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Monday (19 May), Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic firmly denied statements he allegedly made regarding the independence of Kosovo and the possible accession of Republika Srpska (RS), the Bosnian Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Serbia.
Local press quoted him as saying in an interview for the German weekly <I>Der Spiegel</I> that should Kosovo become independent, RS should become part of Serbia.
Zivkovic said his words were misinterpreted and insists that he actually said "Kosovo's secession and the RS' accession would be dangerous precedents." (BBC, Tanjug, FoNet - 19/05/03;

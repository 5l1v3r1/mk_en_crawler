TIRANA, Albania -- The domestic media is not prepared to inform the public about the reforms society and the economy must undergo on the road to NATO and EU integration, according to Musa Ulqini, the head of parliament's Media Commission. 
In an interview with the national news agency ATA on Tuesday (28 January), Ulqini said "Albanians are not yet clear about the benefits of the integration process; many of them have a concept that is far from reality about this issue." He says the media needs to adopt European standards, adding "much should be done to create a class of professional journalists, who should be maximally objective in the information they offer to the public."

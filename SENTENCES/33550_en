SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former US President Bill Clinton visited former Chairman of the BiH presidency Alija Izetbegovic in hospital Saturday (20 September), according to the Belgrade-based Beta agency and AFP. 
Clinton helped open the memorial centre for victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre the same day. 
His official itinerary did not include a visit to Izetbegovic, whose condition has deteriorated since he first suffered broken ribs on 10 September. 
The 78-year-old Izetbegovic was a key figure during the 1992-1995 war.

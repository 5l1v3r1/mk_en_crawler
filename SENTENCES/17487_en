BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police officers killed a suspected Islamic militant after they came under attack in the predominantly Muslim area of Sandzak on Friday (April 20th). 
Police were attempting to search a house near Novi Pazar when a hand grenade was thrown at them, injuring one officer. 
Ismail Prentic, 28, was killed when police fired on the house. 
Another man was injured and a third was arrested. 
Prentic was described as the leader of a local Islamic terrorist group. 
Last month, police arrested six other men, charging them with planning terrorist attacks.

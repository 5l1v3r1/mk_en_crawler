BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Cristian Diaconescu vowed Thursday (1 April) that the fight against corruption among magistrates and all other state institutions would be a priority.
Diaconescu added that for the government to succeed in this effort it must first introduce a clear legal framework and establish strong anti-corruption institutions.
He plans to ask that the staff of the National Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office be increased to work more efficiently.

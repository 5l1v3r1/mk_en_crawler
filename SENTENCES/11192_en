BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- In separate statements issued Friday (28 January), the OSCE Mission to Serbia-Montenegro and the US State Department welcomed news of retired Serb General Vladimir Lazarevic's decision to surrender to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). 
The OSCE Ambassador to Belgrade, Maurizio Massari, called on the Serbian authorities to fully realise their obligations towards the ICTY and redouble efforts to transfer all indicted individuals to The Hague. 
The US State Department's European affairs bureau also stressed the need for full co-operation.
According to reports over the weekend, a second indicted general, Sreten Lukic, will depart for The Hague in February, after he receives the results of an ICTY medical exam. 
Meanwhile, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic suggested that General Nebojsa Pavkovic is also considering surrender. 
The fourth general, Vlastimir Djordjevic, is thought to be residing in Russia.

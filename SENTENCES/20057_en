BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraq is asking Turkey to give it more time to implement measures against the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
A government spokesman told reporters in Baghdad on Saturday (November 17th) that Iraqi Kurdish authorities have set up roadblocks to stop the flow of supplies to PKK militants.
However, he said, the restrictions have been in place for only two weeks and more time is needed for them to work.
Iraqi President Jalal al-Talabani, a Kurd, admitted on Friday that a Turkish operation against PKK bases appeared "almost inevitable".
He added that all indications pointed toward limited military action against PKK camps that would not affect areas under the control of the Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq.
With 100,000 Turkish troops massed at the border with Iraq, several Turkish lawmakers from the ruling Justice and Development Party called on Friday on the PKK to lay down its arms.
Such action, they argued, would eliminate the threat of a military operation and would open the way for democratic reforms in Kurdish-dominated areas of Turkey.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski indicated on Sunday (9 April) that he expects the next parliamentary elections to be held on 5 July. 
In a statement, Buckovski said that if members of the new State Election Commission (SEC) are tapped and endorsed by the end of this week, the vote could take place as early as 5 July. 
Late last week, the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE hammered out a compromise on appointment of the new SEC head, agreeing on the nomination of Parliamentary Secretary Jovan Josifovski.

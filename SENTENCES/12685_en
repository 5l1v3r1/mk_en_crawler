LONDON, United Kingdom -- Western intelligence agencies believe former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic may be hiding in Montenegro, the BBC reported Saturday (2 July).
According to anonymous sources interviewed by Channel Four, the fugitive is living near his hometown of Niksic.
Peacekeeping troops are aware of this information but have no authority to carry out an arrest in an independent country, the report said.
Speaking to the Beta news agency, the head of the town's security centre, Dusko Koprivica, said Montenegro police have no information suggesting that Karadzic is in Niksic.

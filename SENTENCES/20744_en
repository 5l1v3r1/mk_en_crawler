BRUSSELS, Belgium/ANKARA, Turkey -- Unnamed senior diplomats said on Saturday (December 8th) that the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was prepared to revise an article in the penal code that allows persecution of anyone who offends the Turkish character. 
Turkey, the sources said, was also planning to ease property restrictions on non-Islamic religious institutions. 
The reforms hinged on the opening of new chapters in Ankara's delayed accession talks with the EU.
Meanwhile, the new constitution will treat the ban on wearing headscarves in public institutions and universities in a more libertarian spirit, ruling Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) Vice-President Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat said on Friday. 
He also accused opponents to the measure of trying to artificially strengthen fears among secularists, who view the headscarf as a symbol of political Islam and as a direct threat to the separation of religion and state in the country.

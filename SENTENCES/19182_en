ANKARA, Turkey -- A ceremony Thursday (August 30th) to commemorate the 85th anniversary of a key victory in the 1922 Turkish War of Independence seemed to ease tension between the country's military leaders and newly elected President Abdullah Gul.
At the ceremony, Gul, who by law becomes supreme commander of Turkish armed forces, sat next to the Chief of General Staff Yasar Buyukanit and other senior army officers, then chatted with them at a reception afterwards.
The army had opposed Gul's nomination, suspecting him of pursuing a hidden Islamist agenda.
Senior military officials did not attend Gul's swearing-in ceremony earlier this week.
Separately Thursday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso was asked about Gul's election.
"Islamic or secular, we should not let down the democrats in Turkey," he said.
Barroso was in Paris, meeting with President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Turkey's EU bid was a key topic of the talks.

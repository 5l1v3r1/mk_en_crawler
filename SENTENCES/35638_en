SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Wednesday (4 February) that the country is ready to carry out the reforms and restructuring necessary to NATO membership before the Alliance's June summit in Istanbul. 
Parliament must adopt three crucial documents:the strategic defence review, the law on classified information, and the crisis management bill. 
The army, in turn, must transfer responsibility for control of security of the border with Greece to police, destroy dozens of outdated T-55 tanks and increase participation in the international peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan.
Also Wednesday, Brigadier General Georgi Bojadziev was appointed new chief of staff of the Macedonian Army, succeeding the retiring General Metodi Stamboliski.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In progress reports released Wednesday (November 8th), the European Commission has urged Western Balkan countries to take significant measures that would bring them closer.
Albania was praised for its continuing contribution to stability in the region and efforts to curb corruption.
However, the EC called on the opposition and government to reconcile their differences and work together on important political and economic reform and on human rights.
The Commission acknowledged progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina but urged Sarajevo to reform its police force, accelerate the privatisation of state-owned assets, and implement reforms in other areas.
Montenegro was told to fix its weak judicial system and to address problems with organised crime and corruption.
The Commission praised Serbia for its handling of the split with Montenegro and for the administrative reform and the adoption of strategies against corruption.
The EC noted, however, that Serbia is still not co-operating fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Belgrade was also urged to adopt a constructive approach to talks on the future of Kosovo.
Kosovo was the subject of strong criticism by the EC, which said little progress has been made in the fight against crime and corruption and in turning the province into a viable market economy.
The report on Macedonia, meanwhile, criticised the country for a slowdown in reforms.
While new legislation has been adopted to guarantee equal rights for the ethnic Albanian minority, the government must do more to heal a rift with the opposition Albanian parties and to revamp its judiciary and police, the EC said.

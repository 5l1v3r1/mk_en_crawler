BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Netherlands will agree to the European Commission's (EC) proposal to unblock the interim trade agreement with Serbia, Henk Jan Ormel, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Dutch lower house, was quoted as saying Friday (December 4th).
Parliament, he suggested, views the latest report by UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz as positive and had earlier authorised Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen to vote to implement the interim accord in such case.
Ormel also said he is optimistic that another positive report by Brammertz in June would convince the Netherlands to allow for the ratification of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) to begin.
He added however that he believes Serbia should not hurry to submit an EU membership application before the whole SAA is unblocked.

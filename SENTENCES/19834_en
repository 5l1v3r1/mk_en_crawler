SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Education Minister Daniel Valchev announced on Monday (August 20th) that teachers' wages would rise as early as 2008, by a "sensible and balanced" rate. 
There are looming issues in the sector, including demands for better salaries immediately. 
A warning strike is planned for the first school day, September 15th, with a full-scale strike to follow. 
Though budgetary concerns would seem to rule out raises this year, analysts say strikes just weeks before the October 28th local elections could be effective.

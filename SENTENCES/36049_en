SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency adopted a decision Wednesday (24 March) on the size and structure of the BiH armed forces.
According to the document, the army will include 12,000 professional soldiers:
8,000 from the Federation of BiH and 4,000 from Republika Srpska.
The presidency also decided that none of the 12 generals who are to lead the armed forces would come from the current staff.
According to the presidency's Serb member, Borislav Paravac, the decision would help "lift the burden of the war past".

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul began hearing a case Tuesday (November 23rd) against 39 former military conscripts charged with killing 12 prisoners during a riot ten years ago. 
During the 2000 incident at the Bayrampasa prison in Istanbul, the defendants were serving in a paramilitary force, which transferred political prisoners to new, maximum-security facilities. 
The inmates were protesting being moved to smaller cells. 
The former conscripts are also accused of trying to kill 29 other inmates by using excessive force, including higher than permitted amounts of tear gas.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- All efforts Serbia and Montenegro make on their way to Euro-Atlantic integrations are pointless if fugitive war crimes indictees are not arrested and extradited, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot told Serbian-Montenegrin counterpart Vuk Draskovic in Belgrade on Thursday (14 July).
Bot confirmed that he communicated the same message to Croatia regarding fugitive Ante Gotovina and to Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding Radovan Karadzic.
According to Bot, such cases must be resolved to prove the countries are willing to accept the values and standards of the EU.
As for Kosovo, Bot said it is still too early to comment on its future status, as he is awaiting UN special envoy Kai Eide's report on implementation of democratic standards there.

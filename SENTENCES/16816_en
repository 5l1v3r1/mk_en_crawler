SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Friday (5 May) approved changes to the defence law, clearing the way for the abolition of compulsory military service and the introduction of a fully professional army starting in October.
According to press reports, the move is expected to free some 50,000 recruits, between the ages of 18 and 27, from mandatory military service this year.
The legislation also transfers the responsibility for deciding on deployment of troops in NATO peacekeeping operations abroad from parliament to the government after 2008.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A key witness in the trial of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's alleged killers has himself been murdered, a special court judge announced Tuesday (9 March).
Officials say Belgrade businessman Kujo Krijestorac was shot to death on 1 March.
His testimony was considered important because he saw the prime minister's suspected killer leave the scene of the shooting.

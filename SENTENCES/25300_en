PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The opposition Movement for Changes filed a no-confidence motion against the government on Friday (March 26th).
The opposition accuses Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's cabinet of failing to fight corruption and organised crime and addressing the economic situation.
At least two other parties support the initiative, the opposition Socialist People's Party and the New Serbian Democracy party.

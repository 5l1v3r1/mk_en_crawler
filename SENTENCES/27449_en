PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Gracanica Monastery does not believe that Kosovo police can secure its premises and has therefore hired a private security company to guard it. 
The Raska-Prizren Dioceses has already placed a guardhouse on the grounds, just outside Pristina, media reported Saturday (August 28th). 
Police took over security duties there from KFOR last week, in a move criticised by both diocese and Belgrade officials. 
Kosovo police say they are not aware of the church authorities' initiative to provide private security, but added that the monastery has the right to establish rules inside its own walls.

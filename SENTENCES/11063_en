BUCHAREST, Romania -- The abductors of three Romanian journalists in Iraq extended by 24 hours Tuesday (26 April) an ultimatum on the fate of the hostages, in a new video broadcast on Al-Jazeera TV. 
The terrorists have threatened to kill the three and their Iraqi American translator unless Bucharest withdraws its troops from Iraq. 
The four were abducted on 28 March. 
Romania has not responded to the ultimatum.
Also Tuesday, authorities declared a state of emergency in the flood-stricken western Timis region of Romania. 
Ten days of rain triggered what one official described as the worst flooding in 100 years there and in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.

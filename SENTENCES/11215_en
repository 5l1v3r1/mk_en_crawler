ZAGREB, Croatia -- Campaigning for Croatia's municipal elections formally began on Sunday (24 April), ahead of the 15 May vote. 
According to the results of a poll by the Metron/Vectura agency published in Sunday's Vecernji List, the top contenders for municipal council seats are the ruling Croatian Democratic Union and the major opposition Social Democratic Party. 
However, about 61 per cent of voters said they are undecided about participating at all.
In other news, President Stipe Mesic said Saturday after a meeting with the National Security Council that the organisation will tackle all open cases related to co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Mesic added that authorities have intensified activities to close all outstanding cases and track down all fugitives, not just retired General Ante Gotovina.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon told reporters Monday (17 November) that his country is willing to take command of a future EU mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
He noted that any such effort should be closely co-ordinated with NATO.
Experts in Brussels are talking about the possible deployment of up to 6,000 EU troops in BiH.
In other news, Sulejman Tihic, the Muslim member of BiH's tripartite presidency, said he would support the sending of a military unit to Iraq.
He expressed hope that this would persuade the United States not to withdraw all of its forces from his country.

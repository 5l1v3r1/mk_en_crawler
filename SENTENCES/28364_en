PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police and the Kosovo police's anti-corruption task force arrested a senior Health Ministry official Tuesday (July 13th) for suspected abuse of office.
Media reports identify him as Ilir Tolaj, a political adviser to Health Minister Bujar Bukoshi.
EULEX and the Kosovo police searched three locations in Pristina, including an office of the University Clinic, as part of the operation.
The EU rule of law mission said the suspect was detained in connection with a tax evasion investigation.
The raids follow a similar operation in April at the transport ministry, though no arrests were made that time.
In other news, EULEX arrested a man Wednesday as part of an investigation into politically motivated murders in Kosovo.
Local media identify him as Fahredin Gashi and say he was detained based on a request by a EULEX special prosecutor.
"The person has been charged with war crime offences committed in June 1999 in the Lipljan municipality," EULEX said in a press release.
Gashi's name was mentioned by Nazim Bllaca, who has claimed involvement in a Kosovo murder and implicated several senior state, party and police officials in criminal cases.
Gashi denies the allegations.

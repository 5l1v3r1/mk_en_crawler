SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH State Court issued the first war crimes sentence ever handed down by the institution on Friday (1 July), sentencing Iraqi-born Abduladhim Maktouf to five years in prison.
Maktouf, who led a unit of foreign Islamic volunteers during the conflict in BiH, was convicted for his role in the kidnapping of three Croatian and two Serb civilians in Travnik in late 1993.
The hostages were humiliated and abused, and one of the Serbs, Dragoljub Popovic, was beheaded.
Maktouf, who holds Bosnian citizenship, has been in custody since June 2004.
In other news, Livno Cantonal Court Chairman Nedim Begic said Saturday that a procedure has been launched for the extradition of Pero Radic, a Bosnian Serb charged with crimes against Croat prisoners of war in 1992, from the United States.
He was detained two months ago on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by BiH.

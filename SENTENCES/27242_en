TIRANA, Albania -- The new parliament will hold its first session on September 7th, according to a decree President Bamir Topi published Monday (August 31st).
The 140 lawmakers were elected to four year terms in late June.
Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama stepped up his criticism of the election, accusing the government of manipulating the results by allowing prisoners out on Election Day to vote for the rival Democratic Party.
He said that the SP is considering a boycott of the new parliament because "it cannot tolerate a government based on crime." On Monday, media published a list of prisoners sentenced for serious crimes, who went to the polls to vote.

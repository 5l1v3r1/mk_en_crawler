LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Janez Jansa warned on Wednesday (April 9th) that his country may veto Croatia's EU bid unless a positive dialogue on a border dispute between the two countries is established. 
"If the border dispute is not settled or the process of looking for a solution does not begin to at least approach a realistic perspective to achieve a good compromise, everything is possible in Slovenia," he said. 
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader downplayed the statement Wednesday, suggesting it may be posturing ahead of upcoming elections in Slovenia.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The parliament of Vojvodina on Saturday (November 7th) supported the harmonisation of the province's draft statute, passed more than a year ago, with the bill on transferring powers to Vojvodina. 
Amendments to the draft statute were passed by a vote of 84-20, with Socialists proposing some of the changes. 
They include mentioning Vojvodina as an integral part of Serbia and of Novi Sad as the main administrative centre, rather than the capital of the province. 
Vojvodina will be able to conclude inter-regional agreements only, and to be represented in Brussels with the consent of the Serbian government. 
Vojvodina will have its own Academy of Sciences and Arts, as well as a development bank that will support small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
The draft statute and the bill on transferring powers move next to the Serbian parliament for approval.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- War crimes convict Branimir Glavas, who was stripped of his status as lawmaker representing the Croatian Democratic Party of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB), is being replaced in parliament by Dinko Buric. 
HDSSB President Vladimir Sisljagic announced the move on Tuesday (August 24th). 
Glavas' term in parliament was ended a week ago, as required by law, after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for war crimes. 
In late July, his prison sentence was reduced from ten to eight years for crimes committed against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek in 1991.

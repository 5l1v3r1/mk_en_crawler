ANKARA, Turkey -- Police clashed on Wednesday (January 5th) with about 500 students demonstrating against the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. 
The students had gathered at the entrance of the Middle East Technical University's campus in Ankara, intending to hold a rally near AKP headquarters. 
Riot police, however, used tear gas and water bombs to disperse the protestors, who threw stones at the security forces. 
One journalist was injured. 
The planned protest was in reaction to the strong police response to a December 4th demonstration in Istanbul, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with a group of university rectors to discuss reforms in higher education.

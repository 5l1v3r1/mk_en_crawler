ZAGREB, Croatia -- Local elections are being repeated Sunday (29 May) in six Croatian counties, according to the State Electoral Commission. 
The panel ruled last week that a re-vote should be held due to irregularities in the number of ballots cast and the number of registered voters.
In other news, Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic said Friday that NATO is happy with the pace of reforms related to Croatia's bid to join the Pact. 
Roncevic held a news conference with Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, following their meeting with members of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels earlier in the day.

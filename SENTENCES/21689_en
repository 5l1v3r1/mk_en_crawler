ANKARA, Turkey -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the German newspaper Die Welt on Monday (April 21st) that he expects Turkey to join the EU within ten to 15 years if it keeps up its current pace of reform. 
In June, the Union plans to open two new negotiating chapters -- business law and intellectual property. 
As of now, six of the 35 chapters have been opened. 
Rehn also discussed a court battle under way to close down the ruling Justice and Development Party, which he says would harm the reform process.
In other news, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik visited Ankara on Monday and said that while the EU's doors should remain open to Turkey, Ankara should consider alternative ways to join the bloc. 
"I could imagine a tailor-made Turkish-European community as another rational, realistic alternative," Plassnik told a joint press conference with her Turkish counterpart, Ali Babacan. 
Babacan reiterated that Turkey's goal is full membership.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) endorsed on Tuesday (April 17th) the accession of Montenegro as the 47th member of the Council of Europe (CoE), a year after the country proclaimed independence from the former state union with Serbia. 
The PACE deputies praised the progress achieved in various fields and urged officials to implement remaining reforms. 
Montenegro was particularly urged to adopt a new constitution within a year, as well as to ratify a number of CoE conventions. 
The PACE decision awaits final approval from the CoE Committee of Ministers next month.

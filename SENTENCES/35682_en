SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) plans to table a proposal in parliament next week for a national referendum on closing two units at the Kozloduy nuclear power station. 
BSP leader Sergei Stanishev said Thursday (3 June) the proposed question would be "do you agree with closing down the 3rd and 4th units of the plant before Bulgaria enters the EU and before the lifespan of the units expires?" A simple majority in parliament must approve the referendum idea. 
The president then has two months to organise it. 
The government has pledged to shut down the units in 2006 to bolster Bulgaria's chances of entering the EU.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A meeting between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu scheduled for Tuesday (December 28th) has been postponed due to Eroglu's health. 
Their respective aides, George Iacovou and Kudret Ozersay, however, will meet on Tuesday to continue ongoing reunification talks. 
Eroglu is recovering from heart surgery he underwent on December 20th to fix a partially blocked artery.

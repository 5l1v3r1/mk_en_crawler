ANKARA, Turkey -- Voting began in Turkey on Sunday (October 21) on a constitutional reform referendum.
If passed, the president would be elected directly by the people instead of by the parliament for a five-year term, with the possibility of being re-elected for one more term.
The reforms would also reduce parliament's tenure from five years to four and reduce quorum from 367 to 134 members.
The ruling Justice and Development Party called for the referendum after the opposition temporarily blocked the election of President Abdullah Gul earlier this year.
Analysts expect the majority of voters to back the amendments, but some forecast turnout to be very low.
Muammer Aydin, head of Turkey's Electoral Council, said that low turnout would not invalidate the results of the referendum but could undermine their legitimacy.

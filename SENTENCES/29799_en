PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister-designate Igor Luksic unveils his proposed cabinet and government programme on Tuesday (December 28th). 
Luksic is expected to replace six current ministers, though Foreign Minister Milan Rocen and Defence Minister Boro Vucinic will likely keep their posts. 
All new nominees are from the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists. 
President Filip Vujanovic officially proposed Luksic as the new prime minister following Milo Djukanovic's resignation a week ago.

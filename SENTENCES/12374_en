BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission has proposed that Greece be given another year to bring its budget deficit into line with provisions of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.
Athens would have to bring its deficit to 3 percentage points of GDP by the end of 2006 in order to avoid financial sanctions.
It is also expected to draft an action plan for cutting the deficit.

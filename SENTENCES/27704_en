BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) police director Gojko Vasic said on Thursday (November 25th) that security around RS President Milorad Dodik has been raised to the highest level after Dodik received a threatening letter.
Vasic added an investigation is ongoing.
Dodik received threats repeatedly when he was RS prime minister.
The latest death threat was faxed to his party -- the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats -- on November 8th and signed by the so-called BiH Patriotic Front.
The letter also included threats against SNSD officials Nebojsa Radmanovic, Nikola Spiric, Milica Markovic and Dusanka Majkic.

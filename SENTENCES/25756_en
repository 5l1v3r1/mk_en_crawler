PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Leaders are again urging Kosovo Serbs to take part in the November 15th local elections, stressing that institutional integration is the only way to protect their interests. 
Deputy Prime Minister Rame Manaj predicted on Monday (September 21st) that more Kosovo Serbs will participate in the process compared to past elections, since these are the first held in post-independence Kosovo.
Serbia's Ministry for Kosovo is predicting a low turnout for Kosovo Serbs and says candidates elected as heads of municipalities or other municipal offices will no longer benefit from Belgrade-financed institutions within Kosovo.

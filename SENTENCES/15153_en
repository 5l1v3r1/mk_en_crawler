PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Serbs will be part of Kosovo's future regardless of what decision is made on the status of the province, Daniel Fried, US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said on Thursday (28 September).
Fried was on a two-day visit to Kosovo for talks with international and local officials.
He made the statement at a meeting with Serb political leaders in the divided city of Mitrovica.
Oliver Ivanovic, a prominent local leader, said guarantees from Washington and the Contact Group for Kosovo would be vital to the survival of the Serb community.
Also Thursday, UN police reopened a bridge dividing Mitrovica's ethnic Albanian and Serb quarters.
Briefly reopened earlier this week, it was closed again after a group of ethnic Albanians attacked a Serb man.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities must provide evidence of the efficiency of the action plan for co-operation with the UN tribunal by mid-September, Rasim Ljajic, head of the national council for ties with ICTY and one of the officials in charge of the plan's realisation, said on Friday (18 August).
Speaking at a news conference, Ljajic explained that Serbia was following the so-called Croatian model for war crimes co-operation, which allowed Zagreb to begin EU accession talks before one of the tribunal's top indictees, Croatian General Ante Gotovina, was actually arrested.
"I think that we have a good chance to do this here, to give concrete evidence that we put enormous efforts for the location and arrest of [Ratko] Mladic," said Ljajic.
Earlier this year, the junior government partner G17 Plus announced that it would leave the coalition cabinet, if Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks between Serbia and the EU -- blocked in May over the Mladic case -- did not resume by the end of September.

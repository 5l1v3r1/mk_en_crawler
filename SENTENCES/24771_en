BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Belgrade court on Friday (July 3rd) found 12 members of a radical Islamic movement guilty of planning terrorist attacks and illegally possessing weapons and explosives.
The group's leader, Senad Ramovic, was sentenced to13 years in prison.
The other 11, all Serbian Muslims, got terms ranging from six months and eight years.
Three co-defendants were acquitted.
All 15 people, described as followers of the radical Wahhabite sect of Islam, were arrested in 2007 near Novi Pazar in the southern Sandzak region.
Prosecutors say the group operated a terrorist training camp on Ninaja Mountain in Sandzak, where police found a large cache of weapons, explosives, and ammunition.
According to the indictment, members planned to kill Mufti Muamer Zukorlic, leader of the Muslim community in Sandzak, and planned to attack the US Embassy in Belgrade.

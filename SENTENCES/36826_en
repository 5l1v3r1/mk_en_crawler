BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu's office issued a statement Tuesday (13 July), describing his disappointment with the refusal of the major opposition parties -- the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party (PD) -- to participate in political consultations he had initiated.
Last week, the president invited major political powers to talks related to the country's EU accession bid.
Consultations with the ruling Social Democrat Party and two opposition parties -- the Humanist Party and the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania -- took place.
But PNL and PD rejected the idea, accusing the president of exceeding his constitutional mandate.

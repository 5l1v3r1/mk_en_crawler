SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After two days of discussions in Skopje, Albanian and Macedonian experts agreed on Tuesday (February 5th) to fully liberalise the visa regime between the countries.
Citizens of both countries will thus be able to travel freely and stay in the other country for a period of 90 to 180 days.
The official document is expected to be signed later this month.
This cancels Macedonia's previous plan to apply new visa regulations to Albanians, which would have obliged those travelling to Macedonia to apply for a visa at Skopje's Embassy in Tirana instead of at the border.
In other news, a fight broke out in the Macedonian parliament on Tuesday, only four months after a similar scuffle between members of the Democratic Party of Albanians and the Democratic Union for Integration prompted serous warnings from the EU and NATO.
This time, the fight was between members of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party and the main opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM).
It started when VMRO-DPNE lawmaker Cvetko Grozdanov switched off the microphone as SDSM member Vlatko Serafimovski was making a procedural remark.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Despite international appeals for ethnic tolerance in Kosovo, UNMIK was forced to close the main bridge in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica on Tuesday (26 September), only a day after its re-opening.
Monday night, a group of Albanians attacked 41-year old Serb, injuring him slightly.
The bridge had been closed for almost a month, after an ethnic Albanian youngster threw a bomb into a cafe in the northern part of town, injuring ten Serbs.
Meanwhile, Slovak Foreign Minister Jan Kubis said in Washington Monday that UN-sponsored talks on Kosovo must resolve the territory's future status because "the status quo is impossible".
The region risks becoming destabilised if Kosovo remains in its present "limbo", Kubis said.

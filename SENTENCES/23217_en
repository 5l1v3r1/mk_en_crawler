TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Thursday (July 31st) called on the High Court to observe the most professional standards. 
At a ceremony marking the appointment of six new court members, Topi said justice requires a reformed system with a high professional commitment and no political involvement. 
The appointment of the new High Court members triggered a political crisis in June after parliament rejected the president's original nominees. 
The public views the judiciary as one of the most corrupt institutions in Albania.
Also Thursday, local media reported that foreign diplomats have warned the government it is jeopardising NATO membership by pressuring democratic institutions, including the courts and election commissions. 
Sources say at a recent informal meeting, foreign diplomats expressed concerns over moves that seemed to weaken institutions including the general prosecutor's office, the High Court and the secret services.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Congress has decided to tie economic aid to Turkey to Ankara's policy regarding northern Iraq. 
According to the final draft of the bill presented to US President George W Bush on Friday (11 April), Turkey should not deploy troops across the border without co-ordinating its actions with Washington. 
Furthermore, Turkey is obliged to continue to allow the transport of humanitarian aid from its borders into Iraq if it is to receive the $1 billion from the United States. 
According to the final draft, Secretary of State Colin Powell would determine whether Turkey is meeting the conditions.
In other developments, Turkish State Minister Ali Babacan met on Sunday with US Treasury Department Undersecretary John Taylor. 
Babacan is in Washington to attend the spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank.
Also Sunday, the Turkish newspaper <I>Radikal</I> reported that the quick success of the US-led operation to disarm Iraq bodes well for tourism in Turkey. 
The Hoteliers Union of Turkey was quoted as saying that bookings were down in March and April but are expected to pick up in May.

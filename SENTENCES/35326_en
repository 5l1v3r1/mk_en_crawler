ANKARA, Turkey -- Police detained four suspected Islamic militants on suspicion they were planning to bomb the upcoming NATO summit.
A source says the four were detained late Wednesday (16 June) in Istanbul and are suspected of being members of the Ansar al-Islam, a group linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network.
Bomb-making materials were also seized, the official said.
Also Wednesday, parliament adopted a law amending the Code of Criminal Procedure and providing for the abolition of the State Security Courts.
It is another move towards the Copenhagen political criteria for EU membership.

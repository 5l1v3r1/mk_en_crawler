SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski has launched a fresh effort to pressure Greece into recognising the existence of an ethnic Macedonian minority, media reported on Saturday (August 16th). 
Veljanovski has written to his counterparts from the EU member states, the United States, Russia and China, as well as to the presidents of the parliamentary assemblies of NATO, OSCE, Council of Europe and other international organisations.

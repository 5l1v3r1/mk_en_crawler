SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The last 130 peacekeepers from the Bulgarian contingent in Iraq were due to return to Sofia Friday (30 December), after having been transferred to a US base in Kuwait earlier this week.
The rest of the 380-strong contingent flew home before the Christmas holidays.
Bulgaria began withdrawing its troops from Iraq immediately after the 15 December general elections there, in line with an earlier decision by parliament.
Their responsibilities were handed over to Iraqi forces in Divania.
Next year Bulgaria will continue to contribute to stabilisation efforts by participating in some training missions.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A NATO mission will arrive in Macedonia on January 24th, for a three-day visit focused on political dialogue.
According to diplomatic sources cited by A1 TV, the NATO officials will deliver a message from Brussels that progress on Macedonia's membership bid depends on constructive co-operation between the government and the opposition.
Last Friday (January 5th), a scheduled round of political dialogue failed when leaders of the main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia and the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration, refused to attend the meeting.
In other news, Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski spent the weekend in Iraq, meeting with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and with Macedonian troops deployed as part of the multinational coalition in Iraq.

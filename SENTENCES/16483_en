ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The Greek and Turkish foreign ministers, Dora Bakoyannis and Abdullah Gul, agreed Saturday (10 June) to adopt a package of confidence-building measures meant to prevent incidents such as the recent midair collision between two warplanes over the Aegean. 
The measures include a new hotline for the chiefs of the general staffs of the two armies, as well as joint exercises. 
Soldiers from the two armies will learn how to deal with floods and other natural disasters together. 
The two countries will also build a new bridge across their border.
Bakoyannis, who is on an official visit to Turkey, also reiterated Greek support. 
But she also said Ankara must implement its pre-accession commitments and improve the situation regarding human rights and religious freedoms.
In other news, Cyprus moved Friday to block the start of practical negotiations on Turkey's EU accession. 
The country said Ankara was failing to meet EU obligations, particularly the recognition of Cyprus under a 2005 extended customs union protocol.

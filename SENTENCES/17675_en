SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) Parliament's House of Peoples (HoP) finally held its constituent session Thursday (January 25th), almost four months after the BiH general vote.
During the session, the mandates of the 52 elected deputies were officially verified.
By law, the upper house has 58 seats -- 17 Bosniak, 17 Croat, 17 Serb and seven representing other groups -- but due to a lack of candidates, three seats each in the Serb and others' quota are empty.
They will be filled later.
As expected, the first session did not result in the election of HoP speaker or deputy speakers.
But members did endorse an important draft, regarding temporary entity financing for the first quarter.

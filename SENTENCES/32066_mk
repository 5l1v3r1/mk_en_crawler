SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Thursday (17 October), High Representative Paddy Ashdown formally reaffirmed the BiH government's decision to house the Court of BiH in a former barracks near Sarajevo. 
Last week, the BiH Council of Ministers announced that the newly incorporated institution would be located in the Ramiz Salcin barracks. 
That sparked strong protests from some Republika Srpska parties, which argued the barracks had been a detention camp for Bosnian Serb prisoners during the war. 
Ashdown said that if crimes had been committed there, it would "strengthen the case for giving this building to an institution whose function will be to protect individual human rights and punish these most heinous crimes." (OHR Sources - 17/10/02; RTRS, PBS BiH - 16/10/02)

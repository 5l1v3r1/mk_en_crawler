MITROVICA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- KFOR plans to cut back its activities in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica due to a significantly improved security situation, according to Lt Gen Alain Bidard. 
He stressed, however, that the reduced activity - fewer street patrols for example - would not translate into a reduction of KFOR troops.
In other news, SFOR troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) announced Tuesday (10 December) that they discovered a secret arms depot in Duzi near Trebinje. 
It is the largest weapons cache to have been confiscated by SFOR in southeastern BiH.

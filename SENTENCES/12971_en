BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Accession talks with Croatia will not begin unless the country improves its record of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said at a press conference Monday (31 January), adding that Zagreb has so far not shown the political will to arrest fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina. 
Rehn said the EU has reliable information that Gotovina is either in Croatia or in Croat-dominated areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, both within reach of the Croatian government. 
Accession talks are slated to begin 17 March.

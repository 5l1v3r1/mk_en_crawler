TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Wednesday (December 3rd) refused to ratify the newly adopted election code and asked lawmakers to revise one provision.
It requires the president to call national elections nine months in advance, which Topi says violates the constitution.
Parliament passed the controversial election code in mid-November with the votes of the two main parties, the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party.
Smaller parties criticised the changes, saying they excluded small parties' representatives from election committees.

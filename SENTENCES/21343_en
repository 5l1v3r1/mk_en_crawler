BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Thursday (June 26th) asked parliament to hold an extraordinary session next week to approve the launch of a criminal inquiry against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and former Transport Minister Miron Mitrea.
The lack of a quorum thwarted the effort earlier this week.
Prosecutors need parliamentary approval before investigating former ministers for actions while in office.
Anti-corruption prosecutors say Nastase accepted bribes and forged official documents while acquiring his current house, which is worth an estimated 1.5m euros.
Separately, he faces charges of money laundering in the so-called Quality Trophy case, related to how he financed the 2004 electoral campaign.
Parliament does not have to approve that investigation.
Mitrea allegedly allowed an exchange of valuable land in northern Bucharest for less valuable land, despite a lawsuit that was already in progress.
In other news, the Supreme National Defence Council (CSAT) decided on Wednesday to reduce the number of Romanian troops participating in foreign missions next year by 541.
The country currently has 1,425 troops serving abroad, half of whom are with NATO missions.
Last year, the CSAT increased the number of troops for international missions by 346.

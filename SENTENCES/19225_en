SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Leaders of the right wing Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) met on Wednesday (August 29th) and agreed to support one candidate in the October 28th local elections for mayor of Sofia.
No specific name was mentioned, though the candidate will not be a member of either party.
Incumbent Boyko Borisov may be tough to unseat, as he is the most popular politician in the country.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Branislav Medic, one of the five former Scorpions members on trial before the Special War Crimes Court in Belgrade, pleaded not guilty Monday (23 January) to charges related to the execution of six Bosnian Muslim captives near Srebrenica in July 1995. 
Medic admitted that he was at the scene, but said he did no shooting. 
He and the four others were arrested last June, after a video of the executions surfaced.
In other news Monday, the Mostar Cantonal Court sentenced Bosniak Miralem Omanovic to 14 years in prison for war crimes against Croatian civilians. 
Omanovic was convicted of murdering three people at the Potoci camp in 1993.
Also Monday, the United States said it would deport a Bosnian Serb man charged with lying to immigration officers when he applied for the status of refugee. 
Rajko Ninkovic is among 13 Serbs living in the Phoenix area who were indicted last September for failing to disclose their service in the Bosnian Serb Army during the 1992-1995 conflict.

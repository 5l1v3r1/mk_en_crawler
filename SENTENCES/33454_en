SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Through a spokesman, President Boris Trajkovski on Wednesday (30 April) denied a report suggesting he had recalled or dismissed seven ambassadors from their posts abroad.
The spokesman, Borjan Jovanovski, said Channel 5 TV's report damaged the country's diplomacy efforts.
In a related development, however, Macedonian Ambassador to Russia Dimitar Dimitrov submitted his resignation Wednesday.
It was a formality, as he had been recalled for performance reasons.
In other news, 285 more police cadets from minority ethnic communities in Macedonia graduated Wednesday from the police academy in Idrizovo.
A total of 1,000 are to join the force by July, under the terms of the Ohrid peace accord.

ROME, Italy -- Foreign Minister Franco Frattini reiterated on Monday (January 10th) Italy's support for Albania on its path to European integration. 
Albanian counterpart Edmond Haxhinasto was in Rome to sign an agreement on a mutual diplomatic representation in countries or organisations. 
"This gives Albania a possibility to get representation where it was missing until now," Haxhinasto said afterwards. 
He also thanked Frattini for his role in lifting the visa regime between Albania and EU countries.

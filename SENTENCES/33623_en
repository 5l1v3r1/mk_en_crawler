SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ambassadors of countries in the Peace Implementation Council steering board called Friday (12 September) for urgent adoption of the bill on indirect taxation. 
They said the law drafted by the indirect tax policy commission mirrored the consensus reached on this crucial issue and would contribute to creating a single economic space in BiH. 
If the draft were adopted by year's end, BiH would have passed a milestone on its road to the EU, according to the statement.

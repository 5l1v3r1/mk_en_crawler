ATHENS, Greece -- Turkey and Greece agreed on Friday (12 December) to build a highway linking Igoumenitsa with Istanbul.
The four-lane road will follow the route of Roman Via Egnatia, which linked Constantinople with the Western Roman Empire.
About 450 km of the road has already been built in Greece and is known as the Egnatia Highway.
In other news, Bulgaria and Turkey will get EU financing for their joint cross-border co-operation projects, Zhenya Dinkova of the Bulgarian Finance Ministry said on Saturday.
The funds will be disbursed under the EU's Phare programme and will cover three priority areas.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Friday (16 May), Prime Minister Ivica Racan denied speculation he intends to step down due to persistent conflicts with the Croatian Peasant Party, a partner in the ruling coalition. 
Racan had been quoted earlier as saying he would rather become the opposition than continue to be thwarted in his efforts towards EU accession.
Also Friday, Racan insisted the government has no knowledge of the whereabouts of war crime indictee Gen Ante Gotovina, despite claims to the contrary by chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte. 
Racan said if the government knew Gotovina's whereabouts, it would arrest him.

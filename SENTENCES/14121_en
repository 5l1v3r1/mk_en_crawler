NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Friday (14 October) that his special envoy in the name dispute between Maceodnia and Greece has no plans to come up with another proposal for the time being. 
His comments came after Greece rejected his latest proposal. 
It reportedly called for "Republika Makedonija" to be used by the 106 countries that have recognised the country under that name. 
Greece would use the formula "Republika Makedonija -- Skopje", while international institutions and organisations would use the name "Republika Makedonia" in a Latin transcription. 
Macedonia had described the idea as a good basis for talks.

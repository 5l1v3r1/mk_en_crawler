SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (December 20th) invoked a safeguard clause against Bulgaria regarding aviation safety.
An EC press release cited "deficiencies concerning the capacity of the Bulgarian Civil Aviation Authority to exercise correctly the oversight of aircraft personnel and maintenance organisations".
The main effect is to exclude Bulgarian carriers from the benefit of being considered a "Community carrier".
They may continue, however, to operate as "third country operators" to and from member states in accordance with existing bilateral agreements.

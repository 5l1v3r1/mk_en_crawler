BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also is chairman of the national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said on Wednesday (21 December) that Belgrade must provide a response to the tribunal's latest request for several documents within a couple of days.
Prosecutors have said three key pieces of information are missing.
Ljajic stressed that meeting these demands would prove Belgrade's determination for full co-operation.
In other news Wednesday, a new poll by Marten Board International suggests the opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) remains the single most popular party in Serbia.
If parliamentary elections were held now, SRS would get 33.7 per cent, compared to 24.5 per cent for the opposition Democratic Party, led by President Boris Tadic.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's ruling Democratic Party of Serbia would be third with 12.7 per cent.

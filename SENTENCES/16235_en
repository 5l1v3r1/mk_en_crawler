PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Former Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic has been approved as the new Montenegrin ambassador to the United States, MINA reported on Tuesday (November 14th).
He is expected to go to Washington early next month.
Vlahovic has been a fixture of Montenegrin politics since the early 1990s.
Also Tuesday, the Council of Europe (CoE) parliamentary session in Paris concluded that a country must adopt a new constitution to be accepted as a CoE member.
While the Council praised Montenegro for its successful referendum on separation from Serbia and smooth parliamentary elections, it suggested that the panel established to draft the new constitution accelerate efforts.

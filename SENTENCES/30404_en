SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- People headed to the polls on Sunday (January 16th) in eight municipalities where early snap elections are taking place. 
A total of 145,266 people can vote in the municipalities of Bihac, Srbac, Vukosavlje, Srebrenica, Osmaci, Sekovici, Donji Zabar and Vogosca. 
The Central Election Commission made the decision after the mayors of Osmaci and Sekovici were recalled in a referendum. 
In the other six municipalities, the mandates of the mayors were terminated because they won lawmaker mandates in last year's general elections. 
A total of 25 candidates are running in the vote.

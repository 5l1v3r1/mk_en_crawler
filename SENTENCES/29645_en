SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition ethnic Albanian New Democracy (ND) will boycott parliament's work as of Monday (January 31st), the party's central board decided on Sunday. 
ND leader Imer Selmani announced that his party does not want to legitimise the government's "discriminatory, division-minded and isolation policy" and said the decision was prompted by the ruling parties' decision to ignore ND's objections related to the population census, constitutional amendments and the Skopje 2014 project. 
The party has four representatives in the parliament. 
On Friday, the opposition SDSM, the New Social Democratic Party, the New Alternative and the Liberal Party walked out of parliament to protest the freezing of the private A1 television channel's bank accounts.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar briefed government officials Wednesday (June 17th) and parliament's Foreign Policy Committee regarding EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's latest proposal to resolve the border dispute with Croatia.
Prime Minister Borut Pahor told journalists that Zbogar, in turn, was given instructions for his meeting with Croatian counterpart Gordan Jandrokovic in Brussels on Thursday.
Pahor said it is unlikely the two sides can strike a deal on international arbitration by June 26th, when the EU is to hold an accession conference on Croatia.
Croatian media speculated on Wednesday that Pahor and Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader could meet in Brussels on Thursday.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS) and the coalition led by the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) -- including the Pensioners Party [PUPS] and United Serbia [JS] --reached a coalition agreement. 
DS and SPS leaders President Boris Tadic and Ivica Dacic endorsed the accord on Friday (July 4th). 
Under the agreement, the SPS-led coalition will have five out of 27 cabinet posts, which will include the first deputy prime minister who will also be interior minister, a deputy minister for labour and social policy and the ministers of mining and energy and infrastructure and education. 
Dacic refused to name any candidates for the positions, but observers widely anticipate he will take over the interior ministry. 
Dacic also announced that the new ruling coalition would operate on several key principles, such as preserving territorial integrity, advancing EU integration and economic development and achieving social justice. 
Tadic and Dacic said the vote of confidence in the new cabinet is expected next week.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister-designate Vojislav Kostunica formally presented to parliament his new cabinet and its priorities. 
Membership in the EU would be the key task for his government, he said. 
The proposed 19-member cabinet is comprised of representatives of Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, the G17 Plus party of liberal economist Miroljub Labus, and the Serbian Renewal-New Serbia Coalition led by veteran politician Vuk Draskovic. 
Labus will serve as deputy prime minister. 
The Socialist Party said that it would vote for the new cabinet.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Tuesday (19 November) appointed Bulent Arinc as its new speaker. 
His margin of victory indicates that several independents supported him, in addition to members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
That additional support might prove crucial when voting on planned amendments to the constitution. 
One potential amendment would enable AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to serve in the government. 
Currently, he cannot assume a top post, due to a 1999 conviction for promoting religious intolerance.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The government on Tuesday (29 June) said three Turkish hostages held under threat of execution by an al-Qaeda-linked militant group in Iraq had been freed.
"We only know they have been released," a Turkish government official told Reuters, saying he had no other immediate details.
Al-Jazeera television, monitored in Dubai, said a group led by suspected al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had freed the three.
The group had kidnapped the three civilian workers last week and threatened to behead them on Tuesday unless Turks stopped working for US-led forces in Iraq.
State-run Anatolian news agency says Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul confirmed the release of the three hostages.

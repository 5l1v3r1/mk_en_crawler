TIRANA, Albania -- Defence Minister Pandeli Majko says a broad political consensus is needed to approve draft legislation on the transit of foreign troops through Albania and on sending Albanian troops abroad. 
He made the statement during a parliamentary discussion on Thursday (17 March). 
In light of Majko's comments, lawmakers decided to delay a vote on the legislation in order to pursue a broader agreement. 
Majko says the law is crucial to Albania's bid to join NATO.

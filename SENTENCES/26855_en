SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans Tanja Fajon says BiH has made significant progress in implementing conditions in its EU visa liberalisation road map. 
In an interview with the Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz on Sunday (February 7th), Fajon said she expects the country to get a positive evaluation and recommendation from the European Commission, which means being added to the so-called Schengen White List in early April. 
If so, she said, the EP and the EU could complete procedures required to scrap visa requirements sometime in July. 
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro were included in the EU visa liberalisation regime in December.

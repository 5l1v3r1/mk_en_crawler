SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The IMF is ready to provide a 400m-euro loan to BiH to help mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis, the head of the IMF delegation, Costas Christou, said on Tuesday (April 14th).
The IMF and BiH started talks on a new standby agreement this week and should finalise them by the end of the month.
Christou stressed this is the maximum amount BiH could receive in one year, as its quota with the IMF is 200m euros and IMF rules permit only doubling of the quota at most.
Central Bank Governor Kemal Kozaric has said the country would seek up to 1 billion euros.

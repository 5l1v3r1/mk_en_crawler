ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court meets on Tuesday (July 22nd) to set a date for debating the closure case against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), according to NTV.
The court members have examined a report on the case submitted by rapporteur Osman Can, who recommended against banning the party.
Setting a date for debate is the final step in the process.
At least seven of the 11 court members are expected to support closure, the daily Hurryiet reported.
The AKP faces charges of undermining Turkey's secular character.
In other news, Trabzon Governor Nuri Okutan is allowing an investigation into two gendarmerie officers suspected of neglecting their duties and of thus playing a role in the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, local media reported on Monday.
The probe will target former provincial gendarmerie commander Colonel Ali Oz and former intelligence office director Lieutenant Metin Yildiz, who allegedly became aware of a plot against Dink months before his murder in January 2007.

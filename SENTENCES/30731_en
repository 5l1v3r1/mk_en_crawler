KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Arab nations on Tuesday (January 11th) to ignore differences that have strained ties with Ankara and to work together to boost co-operation.
Speaking at a Turkish-Arab Relations Conference in Kuwait, Erdogan said that "Regardless of what some say, we will continue to develop brotherhood and co-operation with our Arab brothers and sisters.
On one hand, we will continue EU negotiations and, on the other hand, we will not turn our back to regions with which we have been sharing friendship and brotherhood for centuries.
He added.
"We are being criticised by certain people when we talk about Baghdad, Kabul, Gaza, Jerusalem and Palestine.
The same individuals question Turkey's presence in the EU.
No one should be insulted, but we determine our own foreign policy," he said.

ATHENS, Greece -- The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday (November 30th) it is eager to proceed with a visit by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. 
A trip scheduled for next week was postponed briefly due to a hastily arranged UN Security Council session focusing on the Middle East. 
That session was later rescheduled for the following week. 
In view of that, Greece says it hopes Gul can visit as initially planned on December 7th.

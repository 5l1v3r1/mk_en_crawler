SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak met on Tuesday (July 17th) with BiH State Court President Meddzida Kreso, thanking Kreso for the co-operation last week that allowed Lajcak to impose measures against war crimes suspects evading capture. 
Lajcak said that strengthening the criminal justice system and BiH's strategy for handling war crimes cases are among his priorities. 
The new measures were imposed against 93 people suspected of helping fugitives evade capture. 
This forced Slobodan Zupljanin, a close relative of fugitive Stojan Zupljanin, to resign as chairman of the BiH Foreign Trade Chamber, though he denies any wrongdoing.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Bulgarian and Romanian legislatures will prepare a joint action plan for EU accession, in support of their planned entry in 2007. 
The move was announced in Bucharest on Tuesday (22 November), following a visit by Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Policy Solomon Passy, who is also a former foreign minister.
Also Tuesday, during a visit to Paris, Romanian President Traian Basescu said his country would no longer accept the perception that it is a corrupt state. 
Basescu maintains that lately, Romania has been no worse -- perhaps even better -- in fighting corruption than some EU member states.

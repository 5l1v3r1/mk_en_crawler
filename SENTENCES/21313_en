THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Culture Minister Astrit Haracia travels on Monday (April 28th) to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague to face contempt-of-court charges. 
He will be joined by his co-worker and former editor-in-chief of the newspaper BotaSot, Bajrush Morina. 
They received indictments on Friday for allegedly trying to intimidate a protected witness into withholding testimony against former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who won acquittal on war crimes charges earlier this month.

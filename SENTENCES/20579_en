ANKARA, Turkey -- The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is facing a major rift after its defeat in the July 22nd parliamentary elections.
Underscoring the split were two separate rallies held on Sunday (September 9th) to commemorate the 84th anniversary of the party's establishment.
One was organised by party chairman Deniz Baykal, the other by a faction within CHP, led by SisÅli Mayor Mustafa Sarigul.
He called on Baykal to resign and take responsibility for the July defeat.
Also Sunday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Nationalist Movement Party leader Devlet Bahceli and cabinet members attended ceremonies in the Sogut district of Bilecik marking the 126th anniversary of the death of Ertugrul Gazi.
He was the father of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire.
Political analysts say the joint appearance may signal rapprochement in parliament.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) on Tuesday (May 12th) criticised local leaders for delaying a decision on when municipal elections will be held. 
AAK official Ardian Gjini insisted on the appointment of an executive head of the Secretariat of the Central Elections Commission (CEC), saying delays benefit the ruling coalition parties and harm the overall election process. 
Earlier this week, President Fatmir Sejdiu announced he will meet all political party leaders to decide on the exact date of the autumn elections.
In other news, CEC head Zait Xhemajli resigned on Tuesday citing "personal reasons". 
Local media reports described it as an example of the chaos within the CEC.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Electoral Commission announced Tuesday (8 June) that it would delay until Friday the release of official results from last weekend's local elections. 
Commission chairman Petre Similean said "counting difficulties and irregularities" had made it impossible to complete work earlier. 
The election was cancelled in the town of Costinesti because the number of ballots cast exceeded the number of registered voters. 
A second round of voting will take place on 20 June in at least 1,500 out of 3,300 municipalities, according to Similean. 
Partial returns suggest that the ruling Social Democratic Party won the most seats in county councils, followed by the opposition National Liberal Party.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Senior Deputy High Representative Martin Ney said on Monday (19 September) that the Republika Srpska (RS) government's Srebrenica Commission should complete its work within ten days. 
He met with senior representatives of the RS cabinet and with commission chairman, Jovan Spajic, in Sarajevo. 
Ney reminded them that in April, High Representative Paddy Ashdown gave the panel until the end of September to provide full information about individuals' involvement in the July 1992 activities of Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica. 
Ney voiced concern that no significant progress has been made in recent months.

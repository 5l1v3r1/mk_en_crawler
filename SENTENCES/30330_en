BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police raided on Friday (March 18th) a house in the central municipality of Despotavac in a search for former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. 
The suspect has been on the run since The Hague tribunal charged him in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

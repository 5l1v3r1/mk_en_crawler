VIENNA.
Austria -- The territory of Kosovo should not be divided, UNMIK chief Soeren Jessen-Petersen told OSCE representatives in Vienna on Thursday (10 February).
He described calls for division as a step towards the past rather than a move towards integration into Europe.
As for developments in the province, he said the past year was one of progress, especially in terms of security.

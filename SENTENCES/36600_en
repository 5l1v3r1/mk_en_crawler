BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Outgoing US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond and Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic met on Monday (2 August) in Banja Luka.
Their talks focused on issues related to The Hague war crimes tribunal, with Bond stressing that co-operation is a key condition for BiH's accession to the EU and NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Bond praised the progress achieved in defence reform, reform of the intelligence service and the tax sector, but added that RS's collaboration with the tribunal remains unsatisfactory.
He said a person with credibility among the police structures must be appointed as the new interior minister.

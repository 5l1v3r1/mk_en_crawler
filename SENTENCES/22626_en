PRISTINA, Kosovo -- There are no secret negotiations between UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier and Belgrade on issues proposed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, UNMIK spokesperson Aleksandar Ivanko said on Wednesday (August 6th).
Stressing UNMIK's transparency, Ivanko rejected concerns raised by officials in Pristina and said UNMIK was not negotiating "behind anyone's back".
Also Wednesday, the biggest opposition party, the Alliance for New Kosovo (AKR), accused UNMIK of trying to legalise Serb parallel structures in Kosovo.
"Zannier should go home if he continues in this manner.
He should sit and read the constitution of Kosovo, not violate it," the AKR said.

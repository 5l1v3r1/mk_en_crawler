WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States announced on Monday (19 September) that it has frozen the assets of a Jordanian-born Albanian citizen who is suspected of organising terrorist groups in the Balkan country. 
The US Treasury Department said that Abdul Latif Saleh received $600,000 from Osama bin Laden to set up an extremist organisation in Albania "to destabilise the internal situation in Albania by fomenting conflict among the different religious groups".

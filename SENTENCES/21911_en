SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sonja Jovicevic, daughter of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, announced on Friday (September 19th) that her family has received notice of a court ruling that releases their assets.
A freeze was first imposed in November 2007 and covered the house of Karadzic's wife in a suburb in Pale, and a flat in Pale owned by Sonja and her husband, Branislav Jovicevic.
Karadzic was arrested in July near Belgrade, after more than a decade on the run from war crimes charges.

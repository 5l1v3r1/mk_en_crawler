PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A Kosovo Serb who was arrested two weeks ago for suspected involvement in war crimes has been released, his lawyer announced on Friday (August 28th). 
Goran Vuckovic was freed after a court decided evidence against him was insufficient. 
He was arrested after threatening a neighbour but was detained due to the war crimes allegations. 
Lawyer Fatmir Selina says his client will have to report to Kosovo police every day until September 11th, to avoid being taken back into custody.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan predicted on Sunday (July 16th) that his Justice and Development Party (AKP) will win between 310 and 315 seats in the 550-seat parliament in Sunday's general election.
A poll published last week showed the AKP winning 298 seats, down from its current 350 seats.
Hundreds of thousands of AKP supporters gathered in Istanbul on Sunday to give Erdogan and his party one last push before the election.
It was one of the biggest rallies of the year.
In other news, two small bombs went off Sunday morning within ten minutes of each other in Izmir.
The first exploded in front of offices of far-right Nationalist Action Party.
The second was in front of a building housing offices used by the AKP.
Police said percussion bombs were used in both cases, causing minor damage but no casualties.
No group has claimed responsibility.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Tuesday (December 8th) that the government has not yet decided when to submit the formal application for EU membership, adding they want to consult with EU partners first.
B92 quoted Tadic as saying Belgrade must wait until it is certain it will receive a positive response to avoid "blockades and slow actions [seen] thus far".

BERLIN, Germany -- The customs office in Bavaria announced on Thursday (January 13th) it has dismantled a cigarette smuggling group from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The operation involved 130 customs officials and police officers.
It resulted in the arrest of eight people and the seizure of 1,500 boxes of cigarettes.
The cigarettes were illegally imported from Serbia and BiH in buses carrying citizens of the two countries who work in Germany.
Authorities suspect the group smuggled more than 3.5 million cigarettes to Germany over the past four months, causing losses to the state of at least 500,000 euros.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal agreed to allow a meeting between former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Bosnian Serb politician Momcilo Krajisnik at the prison facility in Scheveningen, the Dnevni Avaz newspaper reported on Wednesday (August 20th).
Krajisnik wants to talk to Karadzic about summoning him as a witness in his appeal hearing, the newspaper reported.
Krajisnik has until September 15th to appeal the verdict and will conduct his own defence.
He received a 27-year prison sentence in 2006 on charges of crimes against humanity, murder and persecution of civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of a former commander of the Bosnian Muslim army started in The Hague on Monday (31 January). 
Sefer Halilovic, 53, is charged in connection with the killings of 62 Bosnian Croat civilians and a prisoner of war during a military operation in 1993. 
Prosecutors say that in Grabovica alone, soldiers under Halilovic's command killed 33 people, mostly women and children. 
The indictment says that the general failed to stop the killings and never punished those responsible for them. 
Halilovic surrendered to the war crimes tribunal when he was indicted in 2001.
In other news Monday, the UN tribunal convicted Yugoslav General Pavle Strugar of two of six counts of war crimes stemming from the bombardment of Dubrovnik in December 1991. 
He was sentenced to eight years in prison.

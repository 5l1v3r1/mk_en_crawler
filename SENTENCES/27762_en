NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian President Tadic discussed his country's EU bid and relations with Pristina during a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton late Thursday (September 23rd).
Tadic said afterwards that he and Ashton agreed on some "important elements" of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina that could start soon, possibly next month.
Ashton said the talks will mostly be led by authorised officials and experts.
Media in Belgrade report that negotiations will focus first on the easiest issues to resolve including the movement of goods across the Kosovo border, transportation, energy and regional co-operation.
However, Pristina authorities still refuse to discuss Kosovo's status, so Ashton anticipates problems on that front.
The EU would like to help frame the agenda and actively moderate the talks.
Turkey is also offering to act as mediator.
US Ambassador to Pristina Christopher Dell told RTK on Thursday that Serb-dominated northern Kosovo will be among the issues discussed.
He added, however, that Kosovo and Serbia will focus on practical issues rather than on Kosovo's status.

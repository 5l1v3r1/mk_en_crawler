COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Six Muslim men have been detained in Denmark over the past several days in a operation which police say is connected with an ongoing antiterrorism case in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Four men between the ages of 16 and 20 were arrested Thursday (27 October) in the Danish capital, while another two were brought in Saturday.
"We suspect the four young men of being participants in preparation of terrorist acts somewhere in Europe," the BBC quoted police spokesman Joern Bro as saying after the initial arrests.
Bro confirmed that the move is linked to the Bosnian case, in which BiH police arrested three men -- nationals of Turkey, Sweden and BiH, respectively â on suspicion of plotting suicide bomb attacks on the British or American embassies in Sarajevo.
Explosives, firearms and other military equipment were reportedly found as the arrests were made.
One of the men, the Bosnian national, has since been released.

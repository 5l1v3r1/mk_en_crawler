PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- War crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Tuesday (2 September) she does not have enough evidence to bring former Kosovo Liberation Army members to justice. 
She expressed a readiness to step up efforts to acquire more evidence and to investigate former guerrilla members more actively. 
To that end, Serbian Justice Minster Vladan Batic has offered del Ponte access to state archives.
In other news Tuesday, the Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Ministry sent a protest note to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, objecting to a declaration adopted by the Albanian Parliament last week regarding Kosovo. 
That declaration, in turn, was a response to one adopted by the Serbian Parliament. 
Albanian MPs described the Serbian Parliament's declaration as a nationalist effort to unilaterally decide the status of Kosovo.

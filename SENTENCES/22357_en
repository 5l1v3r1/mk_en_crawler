BELGRADE, Serbia -- The chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal, Serge Brammertz, arrived in Belgrade on Monday (November 17th) for a two-day official visit. 
On Sunday, Brammertz expressed confidence regarding Belgrade's intention to bring all remaining war crimes fugitives -- including Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic -- to justice. 
Brammertz meets with the chairman of Serbia's national council for ties with The Hague tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, and war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic on Monday. 
Tuesday includes meetings with President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, among others. 
Brammertz is due to present his regular semiannual report on Serbia's co-operation with the tribunal to the UN Security Council in mid-December. 
His assessment remains a key condition for eventual EU membership.
In his previous report about a month ago, Brammertz acknowledged major progress made by Serbian authorities, especially with the arrest of former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic.

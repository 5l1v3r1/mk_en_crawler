TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the Democratic Party, was due to join Ilir Meta, leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration, at the negotiation table Friday (13 January) to launch talks about electoral reform. 
The main opposition Socialist Party reportedly refused the invitation to attend the meeting. 
Earlier this week, Meta organised a preliminary meeting with a group of journalists, analysts and others to discuss flaws in the current system and possible changes.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) will not consider ending supervision over the Brcko District at its meeting next week, High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Wednesday (June 23rd).
He noted there is one remaining condition for the completion of the Brcko Final Award, that RS make a legal commitment to guarantee the power supply to the district.
Inzko praised Brcko authorities for turning the town into a symbol of success and co-existence.
He stressed that authorities did it by focusing on the economy and education, rather than on politics.

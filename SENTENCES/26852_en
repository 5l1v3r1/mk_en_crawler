BUCHAREST, Romania -- As many as 800,000 civil servants are expected to join a general strike Monday (October 5th) to protest the planned downsizing of the public sector, as well as the so-called single wage bill, which will in effect freeze pay in the sector for an indefinite period. 
According to union leader Vasile Marica, Monday's protest will be the country's largest in recent history. 
He vowed it will continue until workers' terms are met. 
Police officers are wearing white ribbons on their uniform sleeves, since, by law, they cannot walk off the job. 
The unions participating in the strike represent more than half of the 1.4 million civil servants in Romania.

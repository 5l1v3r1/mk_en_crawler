SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku paid a surprise visit to Macedonia on Thursday (20 July), while en route to Slovenia. 
During his short stay, Ceku called on the leaders of the main ethnic Albanian parties in Macedonia to contribute to the country's stability and to respect the results of the 5 July parliamentary elections and the will of the citizens. 
The most important thing for local politicians is to ensure the peaceful formation of a new government, regardless of which ethnic Albanian party joins the cabinet, Ceku said.

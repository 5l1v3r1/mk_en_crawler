BUCHAREST, Romania -- A French citizen convicted in a 600,000-euro bank fraud case has been arrested in Romania and will be handed over to his country's authorities soon, court spokesperson Claudia Ilies announced on Tuesday (August 10th).
Charle Philippe Jacques Paul was detained in a village in western Romania last week, based on an international arrest warrant issued by France in June.
A court there sentenced Paul to seven years in prison in 2007 for using fake ID papers to open 37 bank accounts and request bank loans totalling 600,000 euros.
He had managed to escape during his trial.
In other news, seven people, including a local official, have been arrested and charged with smuggling cigarettes from Serbia, Romanian border police spokesman Ciprian Gaic announced on Tuesday.
He says four members of the group were caught smuggling 18,000 packs of cigarettes by horse drawn cart.
Local official Zoran Vertopan, from the town of Deta, was also arrested as the suspected leader of the group.
Vertopan is a member of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party.

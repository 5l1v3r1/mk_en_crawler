SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Agron Buxhaku withdrew his name from consideration for the new government Sunday (12 December), two days after Prime Minister-designate Vlado Buckovski submitted his list of new cabinet members to parliament. 
The junior government partner, Democratic Union for Integration, insisted that Buxhaku be retained as transport and communications minister. 
Buxhaku said he decided to withdraw his nomination amid an intense media campaign and attacks by former Prime Minister Hari Kostov over alleged corruption.
In other news, parliament's defence and security committee meets on Monday to discuss armed militants in the village of Kondovo, just west of Skopje. 
Some MPs are calling for taking urgent measures to prevent a repetition of events in 2001.

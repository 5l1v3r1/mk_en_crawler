PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A new poll released on Wednesday (July 2nd) suggests that 73% of Montenegrin citizens support their country's bid to gain EU membership, and 51% support NATO entry. 
According to the survey by the Centre for Monitoring, nearly two-thirds of respondents believe that joining NATO would facilitate EU entry. 
Yet most people failed to name a more concrete benefit the country would gain from NATO membership.

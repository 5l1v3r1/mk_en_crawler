ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Monday (7 April) that his country would not send troops into northern Iraq unless there is a threat to national security. 
"Entering northern Iraq will not be on the agenda as long as Iraq's territorial integrity is preserved and there is no move aimed at seizing the oil of Mosul and Kirkuk," he said. 
Turkey is afraid that a Kurdish advance on the oil fields could embolden the Kurds to declare independence. 
US Secretary of State Colin Powell promised the Turkish government last week that the Iraqi Kurds would not advance beyond a certain line near Kirkuk and Mosul.
Also Monday, Erdogan met with his Polish counterpart, Leszek Miller. 
At a news conference afterwards, Miller pledged support for Turkey's EU aspirations and promised to send a regiment to Turkey able to identify and neutralise any chemical contamination in northern Iraq.

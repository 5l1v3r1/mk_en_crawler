TIRANA, Albania -- An internationally backed training project aimed at enhancing police management in Albania in accordance with EU standards was officially launched on Tuesday (18 April). 
It envisions three weeks of training for senior police staff. 
The initiative is being run jointly by the Police Assistance Mission of the European Community to Albania, the US International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Programme and the Albanian State Police General Directorate.
In other news, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) submitted a request to Parliament Speaker Josefina Topalli, seeking the establishment of an ad hoc committee to investigate chief prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku. 
The DP move came as part of its campaign to sack Sollaku, who they say has links with organised crime. 
Sollaku denies the accusations as politically motivated. 
The main opposition Socialist Party says the DP-led government is trying to divert public attention from real problems, such as poverty.

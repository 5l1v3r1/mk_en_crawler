BELGRADE, Serbia -- National air carrier JAT Airways announced on Wednesday (September 30th) it has cancelled all flights until further notice due to a strike by the airplane maintenance company JAT Tehnika. 
JAT says the mechanics are refusing to check the planes before take-off. 
JAT Tehnika, which is owed 1.07m euros by JAT, says it's been forced to stop paying its 900 employees; wages are already one month late. 
Infrastructure Minister Milutin Mrkonjic said his ministry is negotiating with both firms and hopes the issue would be resolved by the end of the week.

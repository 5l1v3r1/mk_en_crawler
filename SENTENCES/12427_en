LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- Addressing EU officials meeting on Monday (10 January), Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, expressed confidence that membership talks with Croatia would begin on 17 March, as scheduled. 
He gave a positive assessment of Zagreb's will to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal, the major condition for starting negotiations. 
Juncker added that he does not expect the recent resignation of Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul to affect the negotiations.

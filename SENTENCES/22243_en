ATHENS, Greece -- About 10,000 protesters marched through central Athens to the US Embassy on Monday (November 17th) to mark the 35th anniversary of the 1973 student uprising at Athens Polytechnic University. 
Dozens died in that student revolt against the military dictatorship that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974. 
On Monday, about 8,000 police officers tried to maintain order, though clashes erupted when youths threw stones, firebombs and water bottles at riot police deployed in front of the embassy.

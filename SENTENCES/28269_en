TIRANA, Albania -- City Hall wants to build a Museum of Religious Tolerance in Tirana, documenting the country's history of religion. 
The idea was presented on Wednesday (November 17th) by Mayor Edi Rama and a group of researchers, historians and representatives of religious communities. 
"This is a museum that Tirana needs. 
A museum that is missing," said Rama, explaining that City Hall will be the initiator and facilitator of a long process in which experts will contribute ideas. 
The building itself would be located in downtown Tirana, surrounded by the Orthodox Cathedral, the Catholic Cathedral and a future mosque.

VIENNA, Austria -- In a speech Monday (June 21st) to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said he expects that after the International Court of Justice delivers its opinion on the legality of Kosovo's independence, the UN General Assembly will urge all sides to find an agreement on open issues through consensus and dialogue. 
He also reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Pristina's independence. 
Jeremic assessed regional co-operation as good. 
"Key bilateral relationships in our part of the world have begun to visibly improve," he said.

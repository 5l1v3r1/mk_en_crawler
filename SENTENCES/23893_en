THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Vojislav Seselj, who is on trial at The Hague for war crimes against non-Serbs committed in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) between 1991 and 1993, faces a new charge:
revealing the identity of witnesses.
According to a filing by the tribunal Wednesday (January 21st), Seselj revealed significant information in one of his books about three protected witnesses, including their names, professions and locations.
Prosecutors say this amounts to contempt of court.
If convicted, Seselj faces up to seven years in prison or a fine of up to 100,000 euros.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The family of war crimes fugitive indictee Stojan Zupljanin urged him on Saturday (December 1st) to surrender to The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
In a letter to the Belgrade-based newspaper Blic, the family called on Zupljanin to stop hiding and to "sacrifice" himself for the nation. 
"The decision is yours," the family said.
Zupjanin's son, Mladen, told Blic that police have raided their house several times. 
"We cannot have normal lives, we cannot get jobs," he said. 
Stojan Zupljanin, a former head of the Republika Srspska police in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is charged with the ethnic cleansing of Muslim and Croats in the 1992-1995 conflict.

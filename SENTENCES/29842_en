BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade convicted 14 people on Tuesday (January 25th) charged with the deadly beating of a French soccer fan, sentencing them to a total of 240 years in prison.
The victim, Brice Taton, was attacked by fans of the Partizan team in downtown Belgrade on September 17th 2009.
He died about two weeks later.
Two men, Djordje Prelic and Dejan Puzigaca, who prosecutors said organised the attack, got 35 and 32 years in prison in absentia, while defendants Ljubomir Markovic and Ivan Grkovic were sentenced to 30 years each.
The other ten Partizan fans will serve terms of four to 14 years.
Vladimir Boskovic, charged with aiding the assailants, got a two-year suspended sentence.
Prosecutors and Taton's family hailed the verdicts while families of the convicts vowed to appeal.

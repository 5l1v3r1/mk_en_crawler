NEW YORK, United States -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu asked the UN to accelerate the Kosovo status settlement process, during meetings with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the US and French ambassadors to the UN, Alejandro Daniel Wolff and Jean-Marc de La Sabliere on Tuesday (March 20th).
Sejdiu reportedly insisted that the most viable solution would be independence, with firm guarantees for the rights and freedoms of all citizens and ethnic communities.

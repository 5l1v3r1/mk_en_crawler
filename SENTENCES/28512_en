PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) is working to validate lists of eligible voters ahead of the December 12th snap elections, head Valdete Daka said on Sunday (November 14th). 
About 6,000 dead people have been removed from the rolls and intensive work is ongoing to update the lists as quickly as possible, given the short window for preparations. 
That has raised questions about how successful the CEC can be in weeding out ineligible voters. 
Daka says these will be the most strictly watched elections ever held in the country, as thousands of local and international observers will be engaged in the process.

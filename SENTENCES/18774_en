SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister-designate Nikola Spiric cited on Friday (January 5th) the acceleration of BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration process, including the sealing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, as his top priority. 
Spiric, a Serb, also said he believes that a solution to the stalemate over police reforms can be found. 
On a different subject, he said he is already consulting with the seven parties that form the parliamentary majority in the BiH House of Representatives. 
He predicted that the cabinet take office in early February.
The leader of the multiethnic opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), Zlatko Lagumdzija, complained on Friday that his party had not been invited to join the new state-level ruling coalition. 
That, he indicated, could affect SDP's support for a draft constitutional reform package hammered out last April.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors charged 15 people Tuesday (January 19th) in connection with the murder of French soccer fan Brice Taton.
According to the prosecution's office, 14 were charged with first-degree murder, and the other with aiding them.
Taton, who was in Belgrade to watch a match between Toulouse and Partizan Belgrade on September 17th, was attacked and beaten by a group of hooligans just before the event.
He sustained multiple head and chest injuries and died about two weeks later.

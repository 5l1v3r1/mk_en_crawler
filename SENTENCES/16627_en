BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu's National Liberal Party (PNL), the senior partner in the ruling coalition, is sticking to its proposal for withdrawing Romanian troops from Iraq, according to a PNL statement issued on Friday (7 July).
It followed a meeting of the party's permanent board, which decided that PNL would continue to seek the pullout despite rejection of the idea by the Supreme Defence Council last week.
The Liberals say they intend to launch a public debate on the issue, which has exacebated tensions within the ruling coalition.
Romania's president, Traian Basescu, staunchly opposes the withdrawal.

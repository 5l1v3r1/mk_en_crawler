ATHENS, Greece -- Police plan to tighten security measures in the capital due to a recent wave of crime and street violence, local media reported on Monday (March 16th).
Deputy Interior Minister Christos Markoyiannakis has proposed establishing a special police unit to co-ordinate anti-crime efforts.
The ministry has also invited experts from the UK's Scotland Yard to help local police battle street violence and crack down on radical leftist militant groups.
Meanwhile, media reported on Sunday that the US State Department has urged its citizens to remain vigilant while travelling to Greece.
Last week, the State Department posted a warning on its web site regarding the risk of terrorist activity and street demonstrations in Greece.

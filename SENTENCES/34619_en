BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (26 August) that "preliminary criminal proceedings" have been opened against Gen Vladimir Lazarevic, former deputy chief of staff and Pristina Corps commander.
He was among several top army officials dismissed by the Supreme Defence Council earlier this month.
Tadic said that if the country really wants to join Euro-Atlantic structures, it must fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal and rid its ranks of possible war crimes suspects.
The Hague has said nothing about Lazarevic.

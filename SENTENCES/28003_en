ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested 27 people Wednesday (June 23rd) for suspected involvement in the attack on a military bus in Istanbul that killed five people Tuesday. 
A separatist Kurdish group called Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, with links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), has claimed responsibility for the attack. 
According to initial information, a bomb planted by the road was activated by remote control as the bus passed. 
During a regional summit in Istanbul Wednesday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused some European countries of failing to provide Turkey sufficient support in its fight against the Kurdish rebels. 
He also criticised those countries, without naming names, for refusing to extradite wanted militants and for failing to stop their sources of funding.

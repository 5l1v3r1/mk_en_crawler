TIRANA, Albania -- Police seized a large amount of ammunition Saturday (October 18th) in an abandoned military storehouse on the outskirts of the town of Corovoda.
They found 90 boxes containing over 83,000 bullets for automatic weapons.
Thieves reportedly stole the ammunition from military storehouses during the 1997 riots.
In other news, police in the town of Gjirokastra destroyed 1,346kg of marijuana and 18kg of heroin seized between 2005 and 2007.
They had kept the drugs as material evidence in six drug-related cases.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament adopted further changes to the referendum law on Tuesday (April 24th), in a bid to prevent suspended President Traian Basescu's return to office, even if a nationwide poll helps him avoid impeachment. 
On May 19th, voters will participate in a referendum to confirm or reject the legislature's recent decision to suspend Basescu for alleged constitutional violations. 
But according to amendments passed on Tuesday, the referendum might be repeated, if voter turnout is not high enough.

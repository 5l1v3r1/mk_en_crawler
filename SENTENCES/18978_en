BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, confirmed that Zdravko Tolimir was in charge of hiding top fugitive Ratko Mladic. 
In an interview published Monday (June 4th) in the Belgrade daily Blic, Ljajic said that Tolimir -- who was arrested in a joint action by Bosnian Serb and Serbian police in a border area last week -- was the logistical chief in the effort to conceal Mladic's whereabouts, and the two are believed to have shared shelter. 
He added, however, that Tolimir and Mladic have not been together recently, and the information does not guarantee that authorities are any closer to locating Mladic.
In other news, tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte kicked off a four-day visit to Belgrade on Monday. 
She will meet with senior Serbian officials for talks aimed at reviewing the Balkan country's progress in co-operation with the tribunal.

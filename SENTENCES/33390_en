SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR Commander Lt Gen William Ward has requested that BiH authorities wrap up planned military reforms within the set deadlines.
According to a report Sunday (4 May) by the BiH Public Broadcasting Service, Ward sent a letter last week to the country's senior leadership at the central and entity levels, insisting that efforts be made towards creating a single army in BiH.
He asked that authorities submit their proposals and plans to SFOR command by 5 June.

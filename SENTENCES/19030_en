WASHINGTON, United States -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is still not strong enough a state to prevent terrorists from using its territory, the US State Department said in an annual report.
Muslim extremists could fairly easily use it as their hub in plotting attacks on other nations, the document said.
At the same time, it praised BiH for progress in fighting terrorism in 2006.
Washington pointed out that 50 individuals, including three with ties to al-Qaeda, were deported from BiH last year.

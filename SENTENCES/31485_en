TIRANA, Albania -- On Monday (21 April), the foreign ministry condemned a statement by Arber Xhaferi, a politician in neighbouring Macedonia. 
Xhaferi, who is chairman of the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians, said last week that the multiethnic states had failed. 
His comment followed an earlier one by opposition leader Ljubco Georgievski, advocating ethnically "clean" states. 
The ministry described the statements as "worrying" and "regressive", adding they contradicted regional integration policy and compromised the efforts of Southeast European states to join the EU and NATO.

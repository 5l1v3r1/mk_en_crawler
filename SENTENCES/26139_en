ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay met on Sunday (August 16th) with the families of Turkish soldiers killed in the long-running conflict with the Kurdish minority, as the government works to end hostilities. 
"Those who came today are mothers, fathers, spouses and siblings. 
You must appreciate that they have sensitivities," Atalay told a press conference after meeting with representatives of families from 12 provinces. 
"We have taken note of their expectations, requests and sensitivities. 
We respect them," he added. 
Representatives of the families, however, oppose making any concessions to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been launching attacks against Turkey from bases in northern Iraq for years. 
The families want PKK members sent to prison.
Meanwhile, a young police officer who was stabbed during a Kurdish demonstration Saturday died of his wounds later in the day. 
It happened during a rally organised to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of the Kurdish insurgency. 
The officer was responding to a riot by Kurdish youths in Adana.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A BiH war crimes court on Wednesday (October 22nd) sentenced a former Bosnian Serb policeman to six years in prison for crimes against humanity committed in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
The court convicted Vaso Todorovic, 40, of aiding and abetting the execution of Bosnian Muslim men and the forced resettlement of Bosnian Muslim civilians from the UN-protected zone of Srebrenica.
Trial chamber President Senadin Bektasevic said the court took into account Todorovic's deep remorse for his actions, as well as his willingness to testify in related cases.
Also Wednesday, Bosnian Muslims marked the 16th anniversary of the 1992 Sjeverin massacre in which Bosnian Serb soldiers kidnapped and killed 15 men and one woman from the village of Sjeverin.
Relatives and friends of the victims held a commemoration ceremony in the village of Mioce and threw flowers into the Lim River.
Later, a procession of cars travelled to Visegrad to place flowers at the purported site of their deaths.
A Belgrade court convicted four people of the massacre.

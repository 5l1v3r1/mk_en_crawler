ANKARA, Turkey -- The army criticised on Wednesday (April 6th) the arrests of over 100 active-duty officers as part of an investigation into an alleged plot to topple the government. 
"The Turkish Army has difficulty understanding the arrest of 163 active-duty and reserve officers," the General Staff said in a statement on its website after a court rejected a second appeal against the officers' arrests Tuesday. 
A total of 196 active and retired army members stand accused of involvement in the so-called Sledgehammer plot of 2003. 
In February, prosecutors requested that 163 of the accused remain under arrest, most of them active duty officers.

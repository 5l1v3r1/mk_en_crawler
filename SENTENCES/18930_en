THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has decided to delay the trial of three Croatian generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac -- which was scheduled to begin on May 7th.
Judge Bakone Justice Moloto said on Tuesday (April 3rd) that several procedural issues must be resolved first.
He indicated the delay would be brief.
The three are charged with war crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians during the Croatian military's Operation Storm in 1995.
In other news Tuesday, the Croatian media reported that local journalist Domagoj Margetic completed a three-month jail term handed down by the tribunal in February for revealing the identity of protected witnesses.
The tribunal took into account the 34 days he spent in custody in Croatia before going to The Hague.

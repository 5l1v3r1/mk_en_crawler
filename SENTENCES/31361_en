ANKARA, Turkey -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou arrived in Turkey Thursday (30 January), heading the EU Troika mission.
The visit was in line with the programme of Greece's EU Presidency, which plans to step up integration of the candidates for membership.
Papandreou held meetings with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul, ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis.
Papandreou said it was the EU's wish that Turkey be able to enter the Union as soon as possible.
EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenther Verheugen also joined the EU delegation.
He said that Cyprus would surely be accepted as member of the EU and that an agreement would be reached by the UN deadline of 28 February.
Verheugen also commended Turkey's efforts in pursuing a peace agreement for the divided island.

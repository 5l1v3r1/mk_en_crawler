ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the far-right opposition Nationalist Action Party (MHP) agreed on Monday (January 28th) to lift the ban on women wearing headscarves in universities.
The two parties issued a joint statement announcing they agreed to amend the constitution and the law on higher education.
The proposed changes would require support from two-thirds of parliament.
Together, the AKP and the MHP have enough seats.
Monday's consultations on the headscarf issue prompted the AKP to cancel plans to submit amendments to controversial Article 301 of the penal code, which makes perceived insults to "Turkishness" a criminal offence.
Meanwhile, a Turkish political science professor received a 15-month suspended sentence Monday after a court found him guilty of insulting the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Atilla Yayla, a professor at Ankara's Gazi University, had said that the state was less progressive in its early stage of development than described in official texts.

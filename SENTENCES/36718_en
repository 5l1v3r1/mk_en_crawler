BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The senior Republika Srpska (RS) government party, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), is urging RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic to appoint Dorde Lajsic as the new minister of industry and energy, acting SDS leader Dragan Cavic said Monday (26 July). 
The post was left vacant after High Representative Paddy Ashdown dismissed former Industry Minister Milan Bogicevic in a sweeping action to remove 59 senior officials for obstructing co-operation with The Hague tribunal.

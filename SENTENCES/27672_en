SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz reiterated on Tuesday (April 27th) that the two remaining war crimes fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic -- must be arrested.
During a visit to Srebrenica, Brammertz said that Serbia is the key to their arrests.
He urged every country in the region to help in efforts to detain the suspects.
Brammertz visited the Potocari Memorial Centre and met with relatives of those killed in Srebrenica in July 1995.
His June report on Serbia's co-operation with the court will be crucial to whether the EU begins ratifying its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade.

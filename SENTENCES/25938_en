BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic signed an agreement Thursday (September 17th) on 100m-euros in budgetary assistance to Serbia.
The funds are part of the Instrument for Pre-Accession funding Serbia is entitled to this year.
It will help Belgrade launch the economic and legislative reforms needed to accelerate its EU integration process and cope with the consequences of the current financial crisis.
"Serbia has the potential to rapidly advance towards the EU, and the [European] Commission stands ready to continue assisting Serbia," Rehn said after the signing ceremony.
Djelic said the assistance would be used for priorities such as paying pensions, housing subsidies and making infrastructure investments.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Tuesday (March 29th) that Serbia should speed up reforms in view of its EU integration process. 
After talks with Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic in Belgrade, Fuele reiterated that co-operation with The Hague tribunal is vital and Belgrade should arrest the remaining war crimes fugitives. 
Fuele stressed that rather than speculating about receiving EU candidate status by the end of the year, authorities should focus on the reform process. 
Djelic said that Serbia will meet all tasks in its EU membership action plan.
Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) has followed up with 629 additional questions stemming from Belgrade's answers to the original EC questionnaire, the EU integration office announced on Tuesday.

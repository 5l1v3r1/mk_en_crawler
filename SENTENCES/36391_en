ANKARA, Turkey -- The trade deficit jumped a steep 80 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003, reaching 5.9 billion euros, the government's statistical office reported on Tuesday (18 May). 
Imports climbed 40.7 per cent to 16.8 billion euros, while exports rose by a more modest 25.5 per cent, reaching 10.8 billion euros. 
The Turkish business community attributes the falling exports to the steep rise in the value of the national currency in the wake of the 2001 recession.

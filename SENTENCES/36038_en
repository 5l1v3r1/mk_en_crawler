SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government adopted a national plan Thursday (25 March) to fight terrorism, in light of the recent attacks in Madrid. 
However, the cabinet decided not to declassify the stepped-up security measures for the time being, saying only that it has instructed the finance ministry to locate funds necessary to finance the programme.

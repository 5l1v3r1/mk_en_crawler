PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A hand grenade exploded late Sunday (April 10th) at a border crossing between Kosovo and Serbia in Brnjak, also known as Gate 31.
The blast damaged the building of an insurance company, but caused no injuries.
Government co-ordinator for the northern Kosovo strategy Ylber Hysa says EULEX police are investigating.
Pristina institutions lost control of the two gates, 31 and 1, in northern Kosovo in March 2008, a month after Kosovo declared independence.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Tensions were high in parliament Monday (June 14th), after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) manoeuvred to get its candidate, Stefan Minea, appointed as a new Constitutional Court supreme judge. 
The opposition Social Democratic Party had pushed through its own candidate, Valer Dorneanu, to the post two weeks ago and even formed a human chain around the ballot box late Monday in an effort to prevent the second vote. 
The second one was required because Roberta Anastase, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, has refused to validate Dorneanu's appointment. 
Anastase is a member of the PDL.

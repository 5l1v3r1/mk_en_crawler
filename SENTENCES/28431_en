ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlement (BIS) has refused a request to mediate the dispute between Croatia and Slovenia regarding foreign currency savings by Croats held in the now-defunct Slovenian Ljubljanska banka (LB), local media reported on Monday (November 15th). 
BIS reportedly does not believe it can achieve anything more, after its arbitration efforts between June 2001 and September 2002 proved unsuccessful. 
Last month, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor decided to ask the BIS to try again. 
Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic confirms a response has been received, but refused to comment on its contents yet.

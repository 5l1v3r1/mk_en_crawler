BELGRADE, Serbia -- At an emergency session on Saturday (December 29th) the Serbian government decided to continue negotiations with Russia on a controversial energy pact. 
Among other things, it includes the sale of a majority stake in the Serbian oil and gas monopoly NIS to Russia and Serbia's inclusion in the Russia's South Stream gas pipeline. 
In a statement, the cabinet said more talks would be held in order to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides. 
It insisted that the deal had the potential to solve Serbia's energy problems.
The session followed intense criticism by Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic, who said the 400m euros being offered by Moscow was too little. 
He also warned that the pact would make Serbia energy dependent on Russia. 
"I am in favour of negotiations with the Russians -- but for negotiations, and not to go with our hands up," the minister commented after the session.

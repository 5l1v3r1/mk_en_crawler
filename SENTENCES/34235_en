PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Outgoing UNMIK head Michael Steiner urged world leaders Saturday (5 July) to become more involved in resolving the status of Kosovo. 
He told reporters that the past four years have resulted in little progress on that front. 
Steiner leaves his post on Monday.
Meanwhile, officials of the Serbian Orthodox church St Nikola in Pristina complained that rock-throwers broke three windows Friday night. 
Father Miroslav added that it took hours for police to respond to his call.

BRDO PRI KRANJU, Slovenia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Turkey's Constitutional Court Saturday (March 29th) not to ban the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Speaking on the sidelines of the EU meeting in Slovenia, Rehn called on the judges to consider Ankara's "long-term interests" in delivering their verdict.
He added that the European Commission is closely monitoring developments with "growing concern and frankly, disbelief".
Two weeks ago, a Turkish prosecutor accused the AKP of undermining secularism in Turkey and asked the Constitutional Court to rule on the issue.
The court convenes on Monday.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission (EC) issued a statement Monday (May 10th), concluding that while Romania has broadly met conditions to receive aid from the EU, the country needs more progress in terms of fiscal reforms, particularly by adopting laws on pension and state wages. 
The statement came after the end of a joint mission by the EC and the IMF, which extended a 20 billion-euro aid package to Romania last year.

ATHENS, Greece -- Unknown attackers shot and seriously injured two policemen while they talked to a suspect in downtown Athens early on Friday (April 3rd), police said. 
It is not clear whether the shooting is politically motivated. 
Earlier this year, two terror groups, Sect of Revolutionaries and Revolutionary Struggle, claimed responsibility for three armed attacks in the past four months targeting a police station in Athens, an individual officer and a police bus. 
The groups published statements that threaten new attacks on "anyone wearing a uniform" in response to the killing of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos by a police officer last December, which triggered nationwide street riots.
In other news, 20,000 Greeks protested the government's decision to freeze wages in public and state-run companies. 
The main trade unions, the Civil Servants Supreme Administrative Council (ADEDY) and the General Confederation of Workers of Greece (GSEE), organised a 24-hour nationwide strike that closed public utility services and halted air, train and sea transport on Thursday. 
Greece's Olympic and Aegean airlines cancelled about 100 flights as air traffic controllers staged a four-hour walkout. 
The print, radio and broadcast media also joined the strike.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry asked the international community to assist Turkey in efforts to curb illegal migration, according to a statement issued on Thursday (December 13th). 
The ministry's request comes after a boat overloaded with immigrants capsized off Turkey's western coast on Saturday, claiming 50 lives. 
The ministry pointed out that the accident demonstrates once again the need for international attention and co-operation to combat illegal immigration.
In other news Thursday, Turkish police arrested 69 people in an anti-terror operation in several different parts of Istanbul. 
Police said 53 of the men participated in illegal rallies in support of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party and some threw Molotov cocktails. 
Reportedly, 24 of those arrested are minors.

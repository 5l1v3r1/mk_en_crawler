BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Serbian President Boris Tadic discussed Kosovo during their talks Wednesday (27 October), saying afterwards they had agreed on the importance of finding a compromise solution to the issue of Kosovo's final status. 
At a forum organised by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Tadic said he wants to visit Kosovo and meet with members of the Serb community there. 
He asked international organisations to assist him in ensuring a safe visit, adding that he has been hitherto advised not to go because of security concerns.

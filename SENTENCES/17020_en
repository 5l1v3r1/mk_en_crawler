SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Authorities introduced emergency measures on Monday (October 2nd) after a huge oil slick oozed into the country's territory along the Danube River, moving from the Vidin region towards Kozloduy, site of a nuclear power plant.
The slick is roughly 70km long and 400m wide.
Teams of the Bulgarian Civil Protection service were deployed in Kozloduy on Monday to build special fences to prevent infiltration of oil into the nuclear station's channel system.
Authorities say there is no risk to the plant's cooling system.

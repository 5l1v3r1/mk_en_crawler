WASHINGTON, United States -- The US State Department has removed Greece from the list of countries that are not doing enough to tackle human trafficking, although its compliance with anti-trafficking standards is still termed insufficient.
In its 2006 Trafficking in Persons report, released on Monday (5 June), the State Department says Greece has "increased its capacity to protect and assist victims in 2005" and improved co-operation with NGOs.
At the same time, the report urges Athens to demonstrate its "political will" by punishing traffickers, most of whom are released on appeal.

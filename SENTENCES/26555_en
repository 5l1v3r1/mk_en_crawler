BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced Wednesday (February 10th) that he will resign if senior ministry officials are linked to organised crime.
The catalyst was another failed attempt to arrest alleged criminal Darko Saric who is suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.
Saric has managed to evade authorities twice -- in Paris and in Vienna -- prompting speculation that leaks from the interior ministry aided him.
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic is among those accusing Serbian authorities of complicity.

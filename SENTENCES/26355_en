BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Rumiana Jeleva's nomination to serve as an EU commissioner is in jeopardy, local media reported on Tuesday (January 12th).
During confirmation hearings on Jeleva as International Co-operation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response Commissioner-designate, she allegedly provided inadequate answers concerning her resume.
This was followed by a controversial interview outside the European Parliament.
At issue was a potential conflict of interest amid allegations that Jeleva served as managing director of a firm called Global Consult until April 2009.
If true, this is in violation of parliament protocol, which forbids EP members from participating in corporate management boards.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has 24 hours to reconsider her nomination.

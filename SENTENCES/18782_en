BERLIN, Germany -- German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country currently holds the rotating EU Presidency, has highlighted the Kosovo status issue as a top problem in 2007.
In an interview published in the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag on Sunday (January 7th), he said the issue was closely related to the stability of the Balkans and that Germany and the EU must work to ensure peace and security in the province.
Also on Sunday, Remi Dourlot, a spokesman for UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, told the Pristina daily Koha Ditore that Ahtisaari's status blueprint would offer "good opportunities" to Pristina and Belgrade.
He expressed the belief that the package would be accepted by both, but did not elaborate further.
Meanwhile, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Ahtisaari to delay presenting his blueprint until a new government is formed in Belgrade.
He said an unfavourable proposal could jeopardise Serbian coalition negotiations.

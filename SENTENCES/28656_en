BELGRADE, Serbia -- An Appeals Court in Belgrade on Tuesday (October 12th) upheld the prison sentences of three former Serbian policemen convicted of killing 50 ethnic Albanians in Suva Reka during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. 
In April 2009, defendants Sladjan Cukaric, Miroslav Petkovic and Milorad Nisavic were found guilty and sentenced to 20, 15 and 13 years in prison respectively. 
The court also confirmed the first-instance acquittal of three other police officers, but overturned the 20-year prison sentence of Radojko Repanovic, former police commander in Suva Reka, and ordered his retrial.

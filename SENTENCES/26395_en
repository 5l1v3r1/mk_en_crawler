ANKARA, Turkey -- Eight members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) based in Iraq have surrendered to authorities in southeast Turkey, in support of a government initiative to give more rights to Turkey's Kurdish minority. 
A prosecutor in the city of Diyarbakir has interrogated the rebels, court officials said on Thursday (November 12th). 
The PKK members surrendered on Wednesday in the town of Silopi, near the Iraqi border. 
Security forces say the rebels claim many others want to return to Turkey. 
This is the second "peace group" to surrender. 
The first one turned in October.

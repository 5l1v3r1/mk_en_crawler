TIRANA, Albania -- The EU is not pleased with the progress that has been achieved in reforming election laws in Albania, Reinhard Priebe, head of the EU's Task Force Consultative Group, said at a press conference Thursday (24 February). 
"We are aware that changes do not happen overnight. 
We do not expect drastic changes from the last elections, but at least you must guarantee standards," Priebe said after the group wrapped up talks with Albanian authorities on the country's political situation. 
The Union acknowledged that there is progress, but said it is extremely slow. 
Albanian Integration Minister Ermelinda Meksi said the standards would be met. 
Conducting free and fair elections is a key requirement for Albania's EU integration.

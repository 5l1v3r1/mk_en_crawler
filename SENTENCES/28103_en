TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha urged the cabinet Wednesday (August 18th) to put a high priority on tourism when compiling their respective budgets. 
He wants them to support the development of tourism areas, including archaeological parks. 
For the first time ever, the number of tourists visiting Albania this year will be higher than the country's population, according to government forecasts, which suggest that tourism numbers have increased 12 fold since 2004, due largely to investments of about 1 billion euros along the coastline.
The opposition Socialist Party, however, expressed scepticism about the tourism figures, saying "the prime minister considers every Albanian immigrant coming home as a tourist".

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar, head of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs committee in the European Parliament (EP) is asking the European Commission (EC) to speed up the visa liberalisation process for Balkan countries. 
Progress reports from these countries were supposed to be presented to the European Parliament by April, said Aguilar in a March 6th letter to the EC. 
However, no such request for a presentation has been made, he added, warning that any delay in the reports would lower the chances the EP can complete the visa liberalisation process for the remaining Balkan countries before the summer travel season.

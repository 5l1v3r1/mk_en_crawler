BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament's security and judicial committees have concluded that Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic is not involved with the Zemun Clan. 
Jovanovic testified before the committees Monday (23 June) about a visit two years ago to the central prison, where he allegedly met with Zemun Clan leader Dusan Spasojevic. 
Jovanovic admitted visiting the prison, but said the purpose was to meet Slobodan Milosevic. 
The committees also cleared Jovanovic of any involvement in the killing of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

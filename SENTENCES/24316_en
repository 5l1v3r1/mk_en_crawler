PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Ten members of the Kosovo Police Service suffered injuries on Sunday (May 10th) near Kamenica, eastern Kosovo, when an estimated 400 Serbs protesting power cuts pelted them with rocks.
Residents of three villages attempted to block the main road over several days' worth of electricity cuts to their communities.
Serb representatives in the area have refused to pay their bills for the past decade.
Protesters also demanded the return of Serbian police and the army to their region, chanting "This is Serbia".

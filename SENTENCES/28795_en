PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) has invited the EU Rule of Law mission in Kosovo, EULEX, to transport ballot boxes used in the December 12th snap elections. 
LDK leader Isa Mustafa made the request Thursday (November 11th). 
EULEX spokesperson Blerim Krasniqi was swift to respond, saying it will "support Kosovo Police ... 
through monitoring, mentoring and counselling. 
The primary role in providing a secure environment goes with the Kosovo Police." Concerns over manipulation are a mainstay of Kosovo elections, as are problems concerning outdated voters' lists and group voting.

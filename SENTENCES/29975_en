PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX is investigating alleged abuse by an international member of its staff and it will not make any judgments before the process ends, EULEX head Xavier de Marnhac said on Monday (April 18th).
The accused official, believed to be the head of personal security for de Marnhac, allegedly offended local mission staff.
Members who went public at the weekend also violated the Code of Conduct, de Marnhac said after discussing rule of law with government officials.
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci emphasised that individual cases do not harm relations with EULEX.
Kosovo Ombudsperson Sami Kurteshi says EULEX should clarify whether it launched the investigation as early as March as is stated in published documents, or took measures only after the case got media coverage.
He says that if it is proved that an individual's dignity was violated in the European mission, then the foreigner's native country should launch a separate investigation.

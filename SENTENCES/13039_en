SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A signing ceremony on accords reforming parts of the constitution was postponed on Sunday (26 February), due to objections raised by Croatian parties. 
The eight largest political parties had hammered out the accords over the past few months. 
But Croat Democratic Union (HDZ) leader Ivo Miro Jovic, chairman and Croat member of the BiH presidency, said HDZ would not sign the deal, which it considers detrimental to Croat national interests in BiH. 
Last autumn, BiH leaders pledged to reach an agreement by March.
In other news, the Office of the High Representative is urging the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Parliament to fully harmonise the entity law on public broadcasting with the state-level law adopted by the BiH Parliament last October. 
Public broadcasting reform was a major condition set by Brussels for progress in the negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the EU.

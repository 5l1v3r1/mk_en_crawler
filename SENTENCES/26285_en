BELGRADE, Serbia -- The new head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, voiced optimism on Sunday (October 11th) that Belgrade's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU could be unblocked by year's end. 
The SAA was signed in late April 2008 but its implementation has been stalled pending Serbia's full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Blic, Degert noted that a positive decision would depend on tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz's expected visit to Belgrade in November, as well as on a possible visit by Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen. 
The Netherlands is the only EU state that has conditioned Serbia's EU bid on capturing fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic.

Six Southeast European (SEE) countries are among 63 world nations with high levels of human development, according to the UNDP's annual Human Development Report, released on Thursday (November 9th).
The 440-page report ranks 177 countries according to their levels of human development, placing them into three clusters:
high, medium and low human development.
Except for Montenegro and Serbia -- including Kosovo -- all states in the region are listed on the report's Human Development Index (HDI), which offers a snapshot of progress on key development issues.
The HDI is a composite index, gauging countries' average achievements in three basic dimensions of human development:
life expectancy at birth, adult literacy and school enrolment, and income, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) in US dollars.
Most of the data used in the assessment are for 2004.
As in the 2005 HDI, the group of high human development nations is led by Norway, with an index score of 0.965.
It is again followed by Iceland and Australia, with scores of 0.960 and 0.957, respectively.
The six SEE countries placed within this group of 63 nations -- in descending order -- are Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Macedonia, Albania and Turkey remain among the countries with medium human development.
Greece has the highest ranking among the SEE countries -- it is placed 24th in the world with a score of 0.921, which is 0.009 points higher than the HDI value it was given in the 2005 survey.
Life expectancy in the country is 78.3 and the GDP per capita is $22,205, up from $19,954 in last year's survey.
In terms of education, an overall index of 0.97 also makes Greece the leading country in the region, although its adult literacy rate is lower than that of most of the other SEE nations, including Albania, where 98.7% of people above 15 are literate.
Despite its higher indices for life expectancy and GDP, Cyprus ranks five places below Greece.
Like in the 2005 HDI, it is again 29th, with a score of 0.903, 0.012 points higher than the one it was given last year.
Its GDP per capita rose by more than $4,000 over a year to reach $22,805, which is $600 higher than that of Greece.
Of the former Yugoslav republics, Croatia ranks highest with a score of 0.841.
A slight improvement in the country's HDI value has allowed it to move up a place.
It now ranks 44th among the 177 nations surveyed.
In terms of adult literacy, which is set at 98.1%, Croatia ranks second in the region after Albania.
As compared with last year's UNDP survey, the country's GDP per capita has risen by a little more than $1,000, reaching nearly $12,000.
Except for Greece and Cyprus, Croatia was the only SEE country ranking among the high human development nations in the 2004 HDI.
Bulgaria, which was first included in this group last year, has moved up a further step to 54th.
A 0.008 increase in its score, set at 0.816 in the 2006 HDI, reflects a 3% rise in the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary schools, as well as a $300 increase in the country's GDP per capita, now standing at $8,078.
Improvements in both Romania and BiH have allowed both countries to join the group of high human development nations for the first time.
Romania, which was 64th in the 2005 HDI, now takes the 60th place, with a score of 0.805.
Its GDP per capita has risen by $1,200 over a year, reaching $8,480.
Although the increase is four times higher than that of its southern neighbour, its lower indices for life expectancy and education place it six positions below Bulgaria.
A 0.014 point increase in BiH's score, now set at 0.800, has allowed it to move up six places, reaching the 62nd position, reflecting its higher education and GDP indices in this year's survey.
Although Turkey's GDP is higher than that of BiH, the country ranks lowest among the SEE countries.
A score of 0.757 places it 92nd in the world, two positions up from last year.
With a score of 0.796, Macedonia is ranked 66th, seven positions lower than the ranking it was given in the 2005 HDI.
With a GDP of less than $5,000 -- the lowest in the region -- Albania is ranked 73rd in the world, with a score of 0.784.

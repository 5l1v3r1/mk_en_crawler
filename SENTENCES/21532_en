TIRANA, Albania -- European Commission (EC) concerns over the country's election code and identity cards sparked reactions from parliamentary groups of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) on Thursday (September 25th).
The head of the SP's parliamentary group, Valentina Leskaj, said the ruling coalition is responsible for producing electronic ID cards and completing election reform.
"[Prime Minister Sali] Berisha is already campaigning to vote using ID cards, but he has not set any deadline to finalise this process," Leskaj said.
DP deputy leader Astrit Patozi says election reform is on the right track and the ruling majority is fully committed to completing it.
In other news Thursday, opposition parties remain divided over a strategy against the government after SP leader Edi Rama criticised Ilir Meta, leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration.
Rama described Meta's political moves Thursday as "incompetent and outdated".
The opposition cannot pressure the government into stepping down by boycotting parliament sessions rather by presenting alternatives, Rama said.

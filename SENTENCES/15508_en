ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court decided on Friday (November 24th) that Branimir Glavas, an independent in parliament, must remain in custody for another month, until December 26th.
He is accused of war crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991.
Prosecutors say he would pressure potential witnesses if released.
Glavas has been staging a hunger strike since his arrest on October 26th.
He insists the charges are politically motivated.

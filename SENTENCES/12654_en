SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The left wing and right wing opposition parties on Friday (4 February) succeeded in removing Ognyan Gerdzhikov as parliament speaker, because he refused to schedule a debate on a failed privatisation deal earlier in the week.
In all, 119 deputies voted to remove him, while 114 supported him.
There was one abstention.
The wrangling began when British American Tobacco pulled out of a deal to buy three cigarette factories from the government.
Gerdzhikov refused to summon the assembly to an extraordinary session requested by opposition lawmakers.
Following his ousting as speaker, the law professor said he would resign from parliament completely.
Fallout from the failed privatisation bid continues, with the government facing a motion on a no-confidence vote Thursday.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Parliament Speaker Zoran Sami suggested on Friday (18 March) that revising the state union's constitutional charter would be the only way to settle disputes about direct elections for the federal parliament. 
Sami expressed scepticism about the likelihood that such elections would be held at all, hinting that Montenegro does not embrace the idea. 
The mandate of the federal legislature -- as stipulated in the 2003 agreement between Belgrade and Podgorica -- expired on 3 March, but incumbent members have continued working because the two sides have failed to resolve the issue.

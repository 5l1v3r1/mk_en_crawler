ZAGREB, Croatia -- More than four million Croats are expected to vote today, Sunday (May 17th) in the fifth local elections since Croatia's independence in 1991, media reported.
For the first time, municipal heads, town mayors and county prefects will be elected by direct vote.
There are 866 candidates.

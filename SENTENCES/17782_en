BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police reform negotiations should start from the very beginning and under a new model, says Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
He was responding on Thursday (March 22nd) to a recent comment by EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who said the three main police reform principles, spelled out by the Union, allow for the drafting of new proposals.
RS has long refused to abandon its entity police force, stalling talks.
High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said on Thursday that one possibility under consideration would be putting all police units -- including RS police -- under the jurisdiction of a state-level security ministry.
Bosniak politicians reject this option.

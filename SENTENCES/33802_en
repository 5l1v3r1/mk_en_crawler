SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Sunday (23 November) that he would encourage the government to extend Macedonia's participation in the international peacekeeping mission to Iraq. 
In addition to the 30-strong contingent, Buckovski will propose sending a nine-member medical team. 
Macedonia's mandate in Iraq expires on 10 December.
On Friday, meanwhile, the interior ministry refuted speculation about possible terrorist threats. 
However, the ministry noted that it has tightened security following last week's events in Istanbul and is maintaining constant contact with security services in neighbouring countries.
On Saturday, the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE said the Ohrid Peace Accord no longer supports the development of Macedonia and should be scrapped in favour of a new national agreement. 
The opposition Democratic Party of Albanians agreed that the Framework Agreement is not working, but blamed it on the current coalition government.

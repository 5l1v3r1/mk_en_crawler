ANKARA, Turkey -- Local media reported on Monday (December 15th) that Turkish and Iraqi authorities have drafted a three-phase plan to end the activities of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.
Turkish Special Envoy to Iraq Murat Ozcelik prepared it after talks with officials from both the central Iraqi government and the northern Iraqi administration.
Under the first phase, the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq will declare the PKK an "outlawed organisation", to isolate it in the region.
In phase two, northern Iraqi officials will call on PKK members to lay down their weapons.
During the last phase, Iraq's central government, the Kurdish regional administration and US forces will join Turkey's military struggle against the PKK in the region.
Meanwhile, the Turkish government announced on Monday it would decide next year whether to end the solitary confinement of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Construction of a new detention facility is under way on the island of Imrali, where Ocalan is imprisoned.
Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin says after the construction is completed in May, the government will decide whether to send prisoners there.

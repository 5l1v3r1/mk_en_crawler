PODGORICA, Montenegro -- All campaign activities end at midnight, ahead of Sunday's (10 September) parliamentary and partial local elections.
This is the first general election since Montenegro split from its union with Serbia in May.
Voters will be electing members of parliament, as well as mayors and municipal councillors in 13 out of 21 municipalities.
In all, 170 foreign observers will be monitoring the vote.
Polls suggest the coalition led by Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic is the solid front-runner.

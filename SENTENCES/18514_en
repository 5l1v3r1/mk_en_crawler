THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbian nationalist leader and war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj abruptly ended his 28-day hunger strike on Friday (December 8th) after the UN tribunal's appeals panel reinstated his right to defend himself. 
The judges also agreed to Seselj's request that all court hearings held in his absence be annulled. 
They denied a number of other demands however, including a petition for the replacement of the three trial judges. 
Seselj also demanded that no documents should be provided to him in electronic form, as he does not use a computer, and that the court should recognise a group of 30 legal advisers who would help him handle his case. 
The defendant, chairman of Serbia's popular Radical Party, is accused of forming a militia that committed atrocities in a bid to expel non-Serbs from areas of Croatia and Bosnia. 
A party official says Seselj may need two months to regain enough strength to appear in court.

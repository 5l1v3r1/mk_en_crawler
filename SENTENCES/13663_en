BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Council of Ministers decided on Monday (19 September) to block a controversial 300m-euro military procurement deal.
The same contract prompted federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic's resignation earlier this month.
The cabinet now says further modernisation of the Serbia-Montenegro Army would be put on hold until authorities complete their investigations.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci signed agreements with the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, making Kosovo a full member of the two international financial organisations Monday (June 29th). 
"The membership strengthens the sovereignty, opens perspectives for economic development and creates jobs for an independent Kosovo," Thaci said. 
"Uniting with these important financial institutions will make Kosovo a functional state and will convince a lot of states to recognise it as the newest state on the globe," Finance Minister Ahmet Shala told press conference in Washington.

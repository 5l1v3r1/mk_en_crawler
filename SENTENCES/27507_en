BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Bozidar Djelic conceded on Thursday (April 29th) it is not certain whether the EU Council will ask the European Commission to start assessing Serbia's membership application in June. 
Speaking to Belgrade-based radio station B92, Djelic explained the EU now seems preoccupied with other issues such as Greece's debt crisis and early elections in Belgium and The Netherlands. 
Those countries, he acknowledged, may want to leave the decision regarding Serbia's candidacy to their new cabinets. 
Serbia hopes to get candidate status in the first half of 2011.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged the Montenegrin government Sunday (26 February) to accept the EU's proposed terms for the upcoming referendum on independence. 
The EU has suggested that the republic become independent if at least 50 per cent of registered voters go to the polls and 55 per cent of them back the motion. 
The Montenegrin government wants the vote to stand if turnout is 51 per cent and those in favour of independence amount to 41 per cent of all registered voters. 
The opposition in Podgorica, which wants the country to stay in a loose union with Serbia, has accepted the EU proposal. 
Solana says accepting the EU terms would ensure international support for the results.

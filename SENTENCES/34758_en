TIRANA, Albania -- A US military delegation arrived on Tuesday (12 August) to review the progress Albania has made in reforming its armed forces.
The delegation, headed by Lt Gen George Garret, will work to enhance co-operation in the field of defence.
According to a statement from the Albanian Foreign Ministry, the government's strategy is to gradually shift military co-operation into military-civil co-operation.
Garret, in turn, discussed the need for further planning in case of civil emergencies.

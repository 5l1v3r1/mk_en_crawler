ZAGREB, Croatia - The OSCE released a report Monday (1 March) that finds ethnic Serb defendants in war crime trials were subjected to discrimination at all stages of proceedings. 
The international organisation conducted a study of 75 war crime trials and found that 83 per cent of Serb defendants received guilty verdicts, compared to 18 per cent of Croat defendants. 
"There must be one standard of criminal responsibility applied equally to all those who face war crimes charges before the Croatian courts, regardless of ethnic of religious affiliation," OSCE mission head Peter Semneby said.
Also Monday, the Croatian government submitted a report to The Hague on the search for retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's top indictees. 
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte will use the report, along with one submitted in October 2003 by the previous government, to assess the level of co-operation.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is asking the Greek government to undertake additional measures within the pension reform bill that parliament will be debating soon, Employment and Social Security Minister Andreas Loverdos announced on Monday (May 24th). 
He says the EC sent a letter to the government on Thursday, insisting the reform should be completely implemented by 2015, instead of 2018 as under the current bill.
Meanwhile, IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard warned on Tuesday that markets will remain concerned until all doubts are resolved concerning the EU actually delivering its promised aid to Greece. 
"The markets are wondering if Greece will be able to repay its debt or not," Blanchard told the French newspaper La Tribune, adding that these concerns are understandable "given the behaviour of Greek governments in the past".

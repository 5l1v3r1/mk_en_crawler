PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said on Friday (August 1st) the country will apply for EU membership by the end of the year.
He said Montenegro could have applied in April, but wanted to meet all the criteria first.
"It is in Europe's interest for the Western Balkans to be in the EU, as much as it is in the Balkan countries' interest to be integrated into Europe," he told Montenegrin state TV.
Djukanovic also welcomed the formation of a pro-EU government in neighbouring Serbia.
"[Prime Minister] Mirko Cvetkovic's government will move forward its integration," he noted.

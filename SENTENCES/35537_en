BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Democratic Party (DS) has "closed the door" on joining a Serbian majority government, says Dragan Marsicanin, the Democratic Party of Serbia's deputy head.
He spoke Sunday (8 February), after Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Boris Tadic reiterated that the DS would not join a government with a socialist component.
G17 Plus has said much the same thing.
Marsicanin insisted, however, that a government would be formed within three weeks.
Tadic, meanwhile, met with US counterpart Donald Rumsfeld in Munich on Saturday.
They discussed the country's aspirations to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, as well as issues related to Kosovo.

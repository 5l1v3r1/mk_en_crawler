Ajvar is a popular Southeast European spread made of red peppers and eggplant that differs slightly from region to region and is traditionally homemade in autumn.
While it is found in many countries, the Macedonian government is trying to trademark the product under the brand name Macedonian Ajvar.
If the trademark is granted by the Institute for Industrial Property, the brand would receive protection as a product with a certain geographic origin.
Macedonia could then seek international protection through bilateral agreements with importing countries, according to the agriculture ministry.
The Institute, however, says a Slovenian company has already tried to patent the product in Germany.
The bid failed because ajvar was deemed a generic name for a spread and thus not subject to trademark protection as one country's property.
Nevertheless, Skopje is going ahead.
"The Macedonian government is attempting to make ajvar a world-recognised product," said government spokesman Ivica Bocevski.
"Branding would allow production to be standardised with the ingredients and its preparation listed on the labels.
This, in turn, will guarantee quality and competitiveness at home and on the world markets."
The government has formed a working group to draft standardised protocols for the ingredients, recipe and production.
Producers will have to comply with strict rules and deliver samples to the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy once a year for quality control.
Macedonian authorities acknowledge that ajvar is being produced in many countries under different names.
However, in the case of "Macedonian Ajvar", they claim to be seeking protection for a traditional, local variety that has had its quality verified by state institutions.

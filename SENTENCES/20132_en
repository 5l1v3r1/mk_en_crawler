ATHENS, Greece -- Two strong earthquakes struck southern Greece on Thursday (February 14th), but no casualties were reported.
The first struck at noon and had a magnitude of about 6.5 on the Richter scale.
It was felt as far away as Italy and Egypt.
The second one was nearly as powerful with a magnitude of 6.4.
The epicentres of both quakes were beneath the seabed southwest of Athens.
Some buildings sustained minor damage.

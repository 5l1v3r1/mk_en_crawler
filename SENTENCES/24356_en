ZAGREB, Croatia -- At its session Tuesday (March 10th), the government adopted a bill proposing a 10% wage cut for all state officials and forwarded the measure to parliament for approval. 
The move is part of an anti-crisis programme aimed at reducing spending.
In addition, the government approved changes to the law on tobacco, which will levy an excise tax on both domestic and foreign cigarettes as of June 1st. 
This decision is in line with requests from the European Commission, which believes the current treatment of foreign tobacco companies is discriminatory.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Addressing the annual meeting of Romanian diplomats in Bucharest on Tuesday (30 August), President Traian Basescu urged them to pursue an active foreign policy that would lead the country into the EU in 2007.
Basescu said their main priority must be to emphasise the country's diplomatic, economic and military potential.
He also listed other objectives, including the consolidation of Romania's position within NATO, development of the strategic partnership with the United States and Britain, and an increased role in the Black Sea region.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Bolivia and Brazil went on the record Friday (December 4th) as saying Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence contradicts international law.
Representatives of the two countries spoke at The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) in hearings on the matter initiated by Serbia.
Bolivia and Brazil warned that Kosovo's secession would have long-term consequences and would create a dangerous precedent in international relations.
Representatives for Bulgaria and Burundi spoke on Friday in support of Pristina's move, arguing that it does not violate international law, nor does it break UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
They maintain that regardless of the final ruling by the ICJ, Kosovo will continue to be an independent legal entity.
Hearings continue all week.

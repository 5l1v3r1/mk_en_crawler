ATHENS, Greece -- UN envoy Matthew Nimetz returns to Athens and Skopje this week to discuss the long-standing dispute over Macedonia's name.
In Athens on Thursday (June 26th), Nimetz will meet with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and other officials.
On Friday, he meets with Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje.
Nimetz recently held a series of talks with the two sides in an effort to reach a compromise but made little progress.
Meanwhile, Bakoyannis is expected to discuss the name dispute Tuesday during a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the sidelines of an international donors' conference in Berlin.
In other news, Greek businessman George Milonas, whom kidnappers released after holding him for 13 days, announced his resignation as president of the Federation of Industries of Northern Greece.
Milonas said he wants to "spend more time with his family".

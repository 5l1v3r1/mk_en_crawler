ZAGREB, Croatia -- Peter Semneby, the head of the OSCE mission in Zagreb, praised the Croatian government Tuesday (8 July) for the legal and administrative efforts it has made to facilitate the return of refugees, but said more must be done. 
"The practical implementation of many programmes remains slow and incomplete," Semneby said, adding that important parts of the new law on minority rights have yet to be implemented. 
He also said that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal continues to be a key condition for the country's Euro-Atlantic integration. 
He praised authorities for their efforts in property reconstruction and for the growing number of Serbs who benefit from the programme.

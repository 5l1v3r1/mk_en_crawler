LUXEMBOURG -- EU foreign ministers on Tuesday (October 27th) called on Bosnian political leaders to take greater responsibility and to seek compromise in order to secure Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) future in the EU and NATO.
They also urged them to seize the opportunity and continue dialogue on a US-EU proposed reform package needed to bring the country closer to the two organisations.
After their meeting in Luxembourg, the foreign ministers of the 27-nation bloc stressed the EU's readiness to continue working with Bosnian politicians.
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, warned them not to drag their feet, as the country could lag behind others in the Western Balkans.

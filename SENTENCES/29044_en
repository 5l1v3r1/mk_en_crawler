PODGORICA, Montenegro -- European Commission (EC) will present its opinion on Montenegro's readiness to acquire EU candidate status on November 10th, the news portal Analitika reported on Friday (August 6th), quoting unnamed international sources. 
The EC is expected to publish the opinion along with its annual progress report on the country. 
In its 2009 progress report, the EC said that Montenegro has achieved significant progress in political reforms, but needs to strengthen the fight against corruption and organised crime. 
Podgorica submitted its EU membership application in December 2008 and hopes for candidate status by the beginning of 2011.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sources cited in Wednesday's (5 April) edition of Nezavisne novine say BiH prosecutors plan to file charges against five people suspected of terrorism. 
Three BiH citizens -- Almir Bajric, Bajra Ikanovic and Senad Husanovic, along with Turkish citizen Cesur Abdulkadir and Swedish citizen Mirsad Bektasevic -- reportedly have been linked to a terror plot in Denmark. 
They were detained last November in the Sarajevo Canton.
In other news, the BiH Court's appeals chamber upheld on Tuesday a five-year sentence handed down to former Islamic militant Abduladhim Maktouf, stemming from war crimes committed in Travnik. 
The BiH Court issued the initial sentence in 2005. 
Maktouf, a former member of the Army of BiH's El Mudzahid unit, was convicted in the October 1993 abduction, imprisonment and torture of five Croat civilians.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and former army chief Metodi Stamboliski were sentenced on Tuesday (December 9th) to three and a half years in prison each for embezzlement and abuse of office. 
The charges stemmed from a 2001 defence contract that cost the country an estimated 2.4m euros in losses. 
Buckovski was defence minister at the time. 
Three co-defendants -- Aco Gjurcevski, Nelko Menkinovski and Mitre Petkovski -- received three years in prison each. 
Buckovski described the sentences as scandalous and said the state missed the chance to prove judicial independence.

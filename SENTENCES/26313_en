BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Social Democratic Party (PSD), the largest opposition party, on Tuesday filed a vote of no confidence against Labour Minister Mihai Seitan.
The arguments are related to the unpopular policies led by the ministry, such as limiting wages in the public sector, and its plans to do the same for pensions.
The two measures have created broad public discontent.
The motion should be reviewed by parliament, with a debate most probably coming on Friday, while the vote itself is expected early next week.

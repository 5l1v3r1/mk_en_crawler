SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) agreed on Sunday (July 11th) to continue its parliamentary boycott launched last August. 
DPA leader Menduh Thaci told a central committee meeting that the ruling parties continue to pass laws that are in their own interest and acknowledged that international organisations have been urging the DPA to return for months. 
The party started its boycott to protest what it describes as neglecting the rights of ethnic Albanians. 
One of the party's demands is to make Albanian a second official language in Macedonia.

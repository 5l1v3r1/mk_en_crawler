NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cypriot Foreign Minister George Lillikas warned British authorities late last week against any plans to launch direct flights to or from the Turkish-occupied northern part of the island. 
On Sunday (December 24th), regional media quoted Lillikas as saying that such a move would have serious consequences not only for Cyprus, but also for Britain's bilateral ties with Nicosia. 
Earlier this month during a visit to Ankara, British Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested that London was looking into the legalities involved in direct flights to Ercan Airport in northern Cyprus.

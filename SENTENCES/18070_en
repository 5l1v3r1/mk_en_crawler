BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police announced on Saturday (March 17th) that they had dismantled a camp that trained Wahabbi extremists near Novi Pazar, following several months of surveillance in the area.
Four men were arrested and a significant amount of plastic explosives, arms and uniforms were confiscated.
A fifth suspect escaped.
On Friday meanwhile, police detained former Yugoslav Customs chief Mihalj Kertes, who was charged earlier in the week with abuse of office and siphoning millions in state funds to accounts in Cyprus between 1994 and 2000.
The other man indicted in the case, Jovan Zebic, died two days after prosecutors announced the charges.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Workers' associations rejected a new government bill Tuesday (25 April) on the status of employees of insolvent enterprises.
According to media reports, association members are threatening to stage protests over the government's refusal to approve financial aid for such employees or those who lost their jobs due to industry restructuring.
Instead, the cabinet passed a draft law aimed at encouraging new employment for such personnel, offering incentives for potential new employers.

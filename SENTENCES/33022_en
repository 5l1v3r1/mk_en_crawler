BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Thursday (22 May) that all cabinet ministers who hinder rather than help the government should step down.
"I think it's high time that people who sit in the government but are unable to assist in its activities should either leave their posts or sit quietly and not obstruct its work." The international community expects political stability in the country, Zivkovic said.
He also said that during a trip to Brussels earlier this week, he assured EU and NATO officials that the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia is solid and the government is stable.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown and BiH Council of Ministers Chairman Adnan Terzic summoned BiH politicians on short notice for another round of talks on police reform Thursday (28 July). 
The move followed the receipt of letters supporting the reform talks from several Republika Srpska (RS) politicians who had boycotted an earlier meeting. 
The goal is to hammer out the next steps in the process, rather than to reach any binding conclusions, said Terzic before the meeting.
Participants included RS Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic, RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic, RS Finance Minister Svetlana Cenic, Federation of BiH Interior Minister Mevludin Halilovic, State Investigation and Protection Agency chief Sredoje Novic, and BiH Security Minister Barisa Colak. 
Police reform is a key requirement for beginning talks with the EU on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

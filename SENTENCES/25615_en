ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor met on Thursday (January 21st) with opposition leaders but failed to resolve differences over constitutional changes. 
The two sides continue to disagree about a referendum on EU accession, voting rights of minorities and voting by the Diaspora. 
They agreed to talk again in February. 
The amendments, required by the EU accession process, need support of two-thirds of all lawmakers.
Kosor also met with Zoran Milanovic, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), to discuss developments. 
Afterwards, Milanovic called for more fiscal restraint and said the SDP would support government steps in that direction.

NEW YORK, United States -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana expressed hope that the EU's EULEX mission would be deployed in Kosovo by early December. 
Solana's remarks came Friday (November 21st) after meeting in New York with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about refiguring UNMIK and deploying EULEX. 
Earlier this month, Ban proposed an amended six-point plan for EULEX's deployment that Serbia accepted but Kosovo rejected. 
The Beta news agency quoted international officials in Brussels as saying that talks are under way among the US, the UN and the EU to persuade Pristina to accept Ban's formula "in some form". 
Under the plan, there would be two separate chains of command for Albanian and Serb policemen in Kosovo. 
In predominantly Albanian areas, police would be under EU command, while police in the Serb-dominated north would report to UNMIK.
On Saturday, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci told Radio Kosova that the UN's six-point plan is "dead", and Pristina is ready to negotiate only on its four-point alternative proposal.

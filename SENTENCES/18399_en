TIRANA, Albania -- A convention held Monday (April 9th) to prepare for a party congress next month revealed potentially serious factions within the opposition Socialist Party (SP). 
According to media reports Tuesday, the meeting was marked by heated debates between two groups -- one backing SP leader Edi Rama and the other supporting former SP chairman Fatos Nano. 
Two issues reportedly are contentious: who should be elected to the helm of the party in May, and how will SP handle the presidential election later this year.

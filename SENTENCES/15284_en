SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Authorities announced on Tuesday (November 28th) that two Bulgarian nationals, suspected of belonging to an international cocaine trafficking ring, had been arrested at the Sofia Airport.
Each of the two, both aged around 20 and described as "drug mules", allegedly flew in from Frankfurt with a kilogram of cocaine in his body.
Also Tuesday, Bulgaria's Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev said investigations are under way to determine if notorious underground bosses have properties and bank accounts in London.
He confirmed that one of those being investigated is the late drug boss Konstantin Dimitrov-Samokovetsa, who was killed in Amsterdam nearly three years ago.

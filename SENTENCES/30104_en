BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council is meeting in Brussels on Thursday (February 24th) to discuss a series of issues, including a post-visa liberalisation mechanism for the Western Balkans countries.
The mechanism, drawn up by the European Commission, is expected to be approved by the foreign ministers.
Its goal is to serve as "an early warning system for EU member states, in case of a massive influx of asylum applicants," the Council said in a statement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti on Wednesday that the new mechanism does not mean that visas will be reinforced, explaining it would only be activated in case of emergencies.

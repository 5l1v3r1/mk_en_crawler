SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former King Simeon II's party, NMS-II, announced on Wednesday (October 25th) its support for incumbent Georgi Parvanov in Sunday's presidential run-off against Volen Siderov.
NMS is a junior partner in the current coalition government.
Party spokesman Stanimir Ilchev said the decision was for the sake of "Bulgaria's normal future".
He described Siderov, of the ultranationalist Attack coalition, as a xenophobe who spurs ethnic hatred.
Earlier this week, the leader of the European Peoples' Party at the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Potering, urged Bulgaria's right-wing parties to back Parvanov.
But the two main rightist formations, the Democrats for Strong Bulgaria and the Union of Democratic Forces, rejected the call, arguing that Parvanov is hardly a democratic choice.

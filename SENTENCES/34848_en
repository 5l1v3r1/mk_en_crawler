ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic urged the public to show determination in building a country based on social and legal equality and on the principles of democracy.
His appeal came on Friday (1 August), during a speech marking the national holiday, Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day, which will be observed Tuesday.
He also said Croatia is considered a respected partner in international relations and would become even more so if it continues to develop along democratic lines.
In other news Friday, employees of the ailing Viktor Lenac shipyard in Rijeka went on strike demanding payment of back wages.
Strike committee leader Damir Bacinovic said the walkout would continue until demands are met.
The protesters are also calling for greater government involvement in problems at the privatised shipyard.

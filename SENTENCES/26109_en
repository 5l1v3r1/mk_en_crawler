ATHENS, Greece -- Fire fighters continued battling a wildfire on the island of Evua on Wednesday (October 14th), a day after hundreds of tourists were forced to evacuate. 
Coastal guards said 500 to 600 French tourists staying at the Club Med near Aidipsos in the northern part of the island were ferried to safety. 
No injuries have been reported so far. 
Authorities suspect that faulty electrical wires at the main power station on the island touched off the blaze, which has been fuelled by strong winds.

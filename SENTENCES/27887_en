STRASBOURG, France -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele reiterated on Wednesday (May 19th) that Hague war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz's report on co-operation shown by Serbia and Croatia will be crucial to their respective EU integration bids.
Speaking at the European Parliament, he said that the European Commission is ready to prepare 'an opinion' about granting Serbia candidate status as soon as the Council of Ministers requests it.
A growing number of sources in Brussels suggest this will happen late in the year.
Brammertz is to report to the UN Security Council in June.

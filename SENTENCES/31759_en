ANKARA, Turkey -- On Thursday (9 January), investigators in Ankara will begin deciphering information from the two so-called black boxes, recovered after the fiery crash of a Turkish Airlines RJ-100.
Wednesday night's crash, several meters short of the runway at Diyarbakir airport, was blamed on heavy fog.
In all, 75 passengers and crew aboard were killed.
Five passengers survived.
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul attempted to visit the crash site Thursday, but his aircraft was diverted by fog.
The fog is also blamed for the collision Thursday morning of two Turkish RF-4 jets during a training flight in the same region of southeastern Turkey.
The pilots and navigators parachuted from the jets, but their conditions were not immediately clear.

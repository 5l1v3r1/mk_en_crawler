PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Thursday (October 1st) that the international community is becoming more interested in stabilising the situation in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo. 
His statement followed reports that the EU will appoint Italian Ambassador to Pristina Michael Giffoni as its special envoy for northern Kosovo. 
"It is important that there will be greater presence of international authorities, European and American, as well as presence of the Republic of Kosovo in the northern part of Mitrovica," Thaci said. 
Belgrade has significant influence in the northern part of the divided town of Mitrovica and the rest of northern Kosovo. 
The European Commission announced recently that it will send a mission to observe the situation at the border between Kosovo and Serbia.

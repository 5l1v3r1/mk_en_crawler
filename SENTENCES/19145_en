SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Doctors began a nationwide strike Wednesday (February 28th), seeking better compensation and more funding for healthcare. 
They plan to hold hour-long strikes every day, though their association insists hospital care would not be affected.
The strike coincides with debate in Parliament regarding a no-confidence motion against the government, filed by opposition parties. 
They blame the cabinet for serious issues in the healthcare sector, including large numbers of people without health insurance. 
A vote is expected on Friday.

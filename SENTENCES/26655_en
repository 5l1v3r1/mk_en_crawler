BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawyers in Serbia launched a three-day strike Monday (November 9th) to protest a government decree ordering them to introduce cash registers to ring up fees for their services, effective in March 2010.
They claim the requirement will violate the independence of their profession and confidentiality.
The justice ministry supports the protesters while the Ministry of Trade and Services says negotiations with lawyers are under way.
Dragoljub Djordjevic, head of Serbia's Bar Association, says 7,000 lawyers will join the protest.
Cab drivers and market owners are also angry they are being forced to introduce cash registers.

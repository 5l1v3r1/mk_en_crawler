LONDON, United Kingdom -- A London Court on Tuesday (April 13th) postponed for a week hearings on Serbia's request for the extradition of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic.
One of Ganic's lawyers, Damir Arnaut, denied reports that the court has approved the extradition to Belgrade.
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade.
Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.
Ganic has denied the charges.

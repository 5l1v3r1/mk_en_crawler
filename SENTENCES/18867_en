BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament (EP) President Josep Borrell met with Croatian President Stipe Mesic on Tuesday (December 5th) and said afterward that 2009 should be seen as the target year for Croatia's entry into the EU.
Borrell reiterated that the EU could not be complete without the Western Balkans.
He also called for implementation of EU-related reforms, both in Croatia and neighbouring countries.
Later Tuesday, Mesic and other leaders from the region participated in a Brussels conference organised by the Konrad Adenauer foundation.
In his speech, Mesic stressed that the countries of the region must be partners, not opponents in the EU integration process.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Friday (17 January), the Federation of BiH's (FBiH) Supreme Court convicted three former Bosniak officials of smuggling weapons to Kosovo and sentenced them to terms of one to three years in jail.
Four other officials were acquitted.
The seven men - including senior police and military generals - were arrested in July 2001 on suspected involvement in channeling weapons to ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.

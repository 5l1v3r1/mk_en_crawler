BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian National Council for Co-operation with UN war crimes tribunal chief Rasim Ljajic on Thursday (June 5th) rejected criticism tribunal Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz made in his first report to the UN Security Council.
Ljajic insisted the report was "incorrect".
He reiterated that four remaining high-profile fugitives are not within the reach of Serbian authorities, as Brammertz claimed earlier this week.
Ljajic also denied Brammertz's claim that the tribunal lacked access to Serbian archives.

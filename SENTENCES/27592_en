BELGRADE, Serbia -- A local court sentenced a football fan to ten years in prison Wednesday (April 28th) for the attempted murder of a police officer in 2007. 
The incident happened during a match between Crvena Zvezda and Hajduk when the defendant, Uros Misic, tried to jam a lit torch in the policeman's mouth, severely injuring him and leaving him unable to work. 
Misic, 21, received a ten-year sentence in 2008 but the Supreme Court overturned it and ordered new trial. 
Misic's lawyer vowed to appeal Wednesday's sentence.

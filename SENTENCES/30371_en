SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The opposition ethnic Albanian New Democracy (ND) party called again on Saturday (February 19th) for the postponement of the population census, from April to July. 
The ND says waiting until summer will enable the participation of more than 250,000 ethnic Albanians who live and work in other countries but return home for the holidays. 
The ND also wants the census conducted over 30 days rather than 15, against to boost participation. 
The party threatens to boycott the process if it is held in April.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz reiterated on Monday (May 9th) that there is no alternative to the arrest of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. 
Speaking to Belgrade-based media on the eve of a visit to Serbia, he deplored the fact that Belgrade has failed to implement recommendations he had made in February and said the country could do more to prove it is co-operating fully with the tribunal. 
The visit precedes Brammertz's report on co-operation by former Yugoslav countries that he presents to the UN Security Council in June.

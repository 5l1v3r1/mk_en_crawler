PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko said on Wednesday (December 12th) that establishing a Serbian government office in the divided city of Mitrovica is a "provocation".
Serbia opened the office Monday, the same day negotiations on Kosovo's future status officially ended.
More than half of the 120,000 Serbs left in the breakaway province live in Mitrovica, and officials say the facility will oversee public services there.
Meanwhile, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic reiterated that Serbia opposes the establishment of an EU mission in Kosovo, as it would mark the beginning of efforts to implement former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for final status.
Belgrade insists the matter be resolved by the UN Security Council.

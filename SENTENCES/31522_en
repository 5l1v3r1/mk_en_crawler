He confirmed the United States has approached his country about involvement in rebuilding, though he said Washington had not made a concrete request, but was studying Turkey's general views on the issue.
Also on Friday, Gul paid a visit to Saudi Arabia to discuss the economic and political situation in the Persian Gulf with countries from the region.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met Wednesday (30 October) with his Yugoslav counterpart, Goran Svilanovic, to discuss co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Afterwards, Svilanovic said that his country's integration into European structures, including the Council of Europe, depends on meeting its obligations to the tribunal. 
He added that the UK views co-operation with the tribunal even more seriously than chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte does.

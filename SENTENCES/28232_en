ANKARA, Turkey -- An historic Armenian cathedral located on Akdamar Island in eastern Turkey will be opened for worship for the first time in 95 years on Sunday (September 19th). 
Some 5,000 people are expected to attend the liturgy. 
The 10th century church was renovated and opened in 2007 as a museum. 
It will host a religious service once a year, as approved by the Van governor's office and the Tourism Ministry. 
Opening of the Holy Cross cathedral to religious worshippers is seen as a gesture towards reconciliation with Armenians and a sign of religious tolerance.

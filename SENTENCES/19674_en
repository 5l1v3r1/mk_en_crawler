BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament has adopted a resolution that says RS has the right to secede from BiH if most UN and EU countries recognise Kosovo's independence. 
Parliament met on Thursday (February 21st) to discuss the Kosovo issue. 
The resolution was approved by an overwhelming majority.
As lawmakers debated the resolution, several hundred people, mostly students, protested in downtown Banja Luka against Kosovo's decision to break from Serbia. 
The demonstration eventually turned violent, forcing police to use tear gas to stop protestors from reaching the government building and nearby foreign embassies. 
A parallel protest in the RS town of Trebinje was peaceful.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn welcomed Serbia's decision to unilaterally implement its interim trade agreement with the EU next year as part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. 
The decision will "accelerate Serbia's progress on its European path", Rehn told the daily Vecernje Novosti on Thursday (October 23rd). 
"The year 2009 could be key for Serbia's EU accession process. 
If all conditions are met, Serbia can become a candidate state by the end of next year," Rehn said. 
He added that, apart from implementing the interim trade accord, Serbia can do one more thing to speed up the process: "Work hard to co-operate with The Hague war crimes tribunal and prove that this obstacle has been overcome." (Vecernje novosti, Tanjug, B92 - 23/10/08)

BUCHAREST, Romania -- UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband met with Romanian counterpart Adrian Cioroianu in Bucharest on Tuesday (September 4th) and said his country plans to review restrictions applied to Romanian and Bulgarian workers at the end of this year.
Miliband said that as most other EU members, the UK restricted access to the job market to better manage it, but a review process is already under way.
Miliband, along with French and Serbian counterparts Bernard Kouchener and Vuk Jeremic, took part in the annual meeting of Romania's diplomatic corps in Bucharest.

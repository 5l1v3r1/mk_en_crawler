TIRANA, Albania -- The government proposed a new law Monday (16 December) on the voluntary collection of weapons from civilians, replacing legislation that expired over the summer. 
Residents would be encouraged to surrender their weapons to local authorities who could then claim up to $50,000 to invest in local schools and community projects. 
The money will come from the UNDP, which has set aside $800,000 over the next two years. 
The previous law, which contained similar provisions, resulted in the collection of 200,000 weapons, or about 40 per cent of what was stolen from army and police warehouses during the riots of 1997.
In other news, Eugen Scanteie, World Bank country manager for Albania, met Monday with Prime Minister Fatos Nano in Tirana to discuss issues concerning the government's economic development strategy. 
Nano assured him that the government is working in accordance with a programme that aims to meet IMF and World Bank requirements for further financial assistance.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The 13th Higher Criminal Court in Istanbul decided on Monday (August 3rd) to formally combine the first Ergenekon case with the so-called Council of State attack against Turkey's top administrative court on May 17th 2006, which killed one judge. 
Initially, it appeared gunman Alparslan Arslan opened fire over a court decision to uphold a ban on women wearing Islamic headscarves in universities and government offices. 
However, as that trial unfolded, suspicion grew that members of the shadowy Ergenekon organisation were behind the shooting. 
The group is accused of plotting high profile assassinations in a bid to overthrow the ruling Justice and Development Party's government. 
Some of the 86 suspects in the Ergenekon case walked out of the courtroom to protest Monday's decision.

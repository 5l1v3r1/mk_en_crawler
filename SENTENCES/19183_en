PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Podgorica Prosecutor's Office has filed charges against senior police official Sreten Glendza for suspected involvement in war crimes 15 years ago. 
Glendza, who presently heads the coastal town of Ulcinj's criminal department, served as chief of Ulcinj's security department at the time.
According to local media, he is believed to be responsible for the arrest and deportation of at least eight Muslim refugees, sent back to Republika Srpska in 1992. 
Only one of the eight survived; the others are listed as missing. 
The Podgorica High Court is conducting a similar probe against five other former senior Montenegrin police officials.

PARIS, France -- Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner has urged Kosovo Albanians to maintain a conciliatory and co-operative attitude during talks Monday (October 22nd) on Kosovo's final status.
The delegation headed on to Vienna for the talks with delegates from Serbia, following an informal meeting Sunday with Kouchner in Paris.
He advised the Pristina delegation, led by Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, against any unilateral declaration of independence, saying it may be rejected by some EU member states.
Sejdiu, meanwhile, said Kosovo Albanians insist that negotiations end as scheduled on December 10th.

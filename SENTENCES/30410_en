ANKARA, Turkey -- Police detained 20 people Thursday (March 17th) as part of a probe into the murder of three Christian missionaries in Malatya in 2007.
The detainees are suspected of having instigated the killings as part of the plan by the so-called Ergenekon organisation to topple the government.
Raids were conducted in nine provinces Thursday.
Among those detained is the former commander of the gendarmerie in Malatya, Colonel Mehmet Ulger.

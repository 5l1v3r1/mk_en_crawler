PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The acting head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Amfilohije Radovic, warned of future conflicts in the Balkans over Kosovo on Friday (October 17th). 
War is inevitable again one day because of the conditions faced by the Serb minority in Kosovo, he said to Reuters in Montenegro. 
"Amid such injustice, there cannot be peace," Radovic said.
In other news Friday, Montenegrin police tightened Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's security after Podgorica's recognition of Kosovo's independence, local media reported. 
Police want to forestall possible threats to his and his family's safety, sources said. 
Media report the majority of ministers are now receiving increased protection.
Earlier this week, the leader of the opposition Serb List, Andrija Mandic, started a hunger strike to protest the recognition of Kosovo's independence.

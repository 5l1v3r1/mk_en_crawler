SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond paid a visit to the joint BiH-Croatian terminal at Doljani on Thursday (1 May).
He also met with the head of the Federation of BiH Customs Office, Zelimir Rebac, to discuss reforms in the customs sector, implementation of relevant laws and the fight against organised crime.
Rebac stressed that his office needs assistance, as it might not have the strength to fight the mafia alone.
Bond pledged that the United States would provide full political support.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Reforming the judiciary has been slow across Eastern Europe, the World Bank said in a report released Monday (20 June). 
It said changes in this area have lagged far behind reforms in politics and the economy. 
According to the Bank, Bulgaria and Romania still face the challenges of developing independent and accountable court systems and rooting out corruption. 
Macedonia, the Bank said, has a high demand for judicial services but only moderate capacity. 
Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia, the report noted, are in the process of revising their case handling procedures and implementing modern technology to make courts more efficient.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The law enforcement agencies are launching a massive operation against organised crime groups and related individuals, Interior Minister Roumen Petkov announced on Friday (26 August), after a meeting with Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski, Chief Prosecutor Nikola Filchev and the National Investigation Chief Angel Alexandrov. 
The meeting followed the murder of a key underground figure, Georgi Iliev, who was gunned down Thursday in the Black Sea resort of Slanchev Briag.
In other news, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's rapporteur Tony Lloyd is urging Libya to overturn the death sentences issued against five Bulgarian nurses. 
Lloyd wrapped up a three-day visit to Libya late last week and concluded that the nurses were "clearly innocent" of charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the HIV. 
Libya's Supreme Court is expected to rule on an appeal in November.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected criticism of the country's new draft constitution at a press conference Wednesday (September 19th). 
He defended his government's draft, saying the document will be representative of the whole country, not just the ruling party. 
He also indicated that the draft would include phrases removing the ban on wearing headscarves in universities. 
"We are talking about freedoms here," Erdogan said, adding that "the headscarf is not a symbol of a political party." Members of the opposition have accused the government of trying to put an Islamic stamp on the constitution and erode secular traditions.
In other news, newly elected President Abdullah Gul blamed the Cypriot government for the lack of progress in reunifying the Greek and Turkish parts of the island, during a visit to Nicosia on Wednesday. 
The Cypriot government filed an immediate complaint with the EU and the UN over what it described as Gul's illegal visit to an entity only Ankara officially recognises.

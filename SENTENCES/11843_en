SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Turkey would like to increase significantly the volume of its trade with BiH, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday (16 February).
Turkish exports to BiH totalled $90m in the first 11 months of 2004, while imports barely reached $11m.
BiH counterpart Adnan Terzic told reporters after meeting with Erdogan that a new agreement with Turkey on avoiding double taxation should encourage Turkish business investment in BiH.
Erdogan is on a two-day visit to the country.
He travels to Mostar on Thursday to see the city's recently restored Old Bridge.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (July 23rd) to strengthen the Union's role in efforts to determine the final status of Kosovo. 
The ministers backed a German proposal to establish a troika of EU, US and Russian mediators for another 120 days of talks between Belgrade and Pristina. 
The EU could eventually assume overall responsibility for the process, said EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who criticised the UN Security Council for failing to resolve the matter.
Also Monday, the Serbian government adopted a draft resolution calling for "a just resolution of Kosovo issue, based on international law", and forwarded it to parliament, for debate on Tuesday. 
The draft reiterates that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia is guaranteed not only by the country's constitution, but also by the UN Charter.

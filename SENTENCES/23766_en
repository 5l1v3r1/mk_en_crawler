NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Friday (December 19th) urged The Hague war crimes tribunal to end its trials quickly and efficiently. 
Although the tribunal's mandate calls for its first-degree process to be wrapped up by 2009, the court says some of its work will not be completed even by the end of 2010. 
Considering possible appeals, some trials will likely continue through 2012.

STRASBOURG, France -- A report by Council of Europe rapporteur Dick Marty alleging human organ trafficking in Kosovo will be the focus of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)'s winter session, which starts in Strasbourg on Monday (January 24th). 
In a draft resolution based on the document, PACE urges the international community, authorities in Belgrade, Pristina and Tirana to undertake concrete measures to shed light on the allegations. 
It adds that establishing the truth about atrocities in Kosovo and helping to determine the fate of those still missing is vital to reconciliation among communities.

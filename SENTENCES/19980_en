TIRANA, Albania -- The British, French, Danish, German and Dutch permanent representatives to NATO visited Tirana on Thursday (January 17th) and urged President Bamir Topi to accelerate reforms if Albania wants an invitation to join the Alliance at the Bucharest summit in April.
For his part, Topi briefed them about key electoral and judicial reforms and on the improved political climate based on better co-operation between the majority and the opposition.
But the same day, the Republican Party, a junior coalition ally of the ruling Democratic Party, called for changes in the cabinet.
Earlier this week, the other junior government partner, the Human Rights Union Party, threatened to leave the coalition unless there's a reshuffle.

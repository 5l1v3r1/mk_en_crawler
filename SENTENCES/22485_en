ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey can serve as a mediator in conflicts between the United States and Iran stemming from Tehran's nuclear programme, Turkish media reported on Wednesday (November 12th). 
In an interview with The New York Times on Sunday, Erdogan said Ankara is watching relations between the two countries "with great concern" and supports resolving all issues via negotiations. 
He added that Turkey's good relations with Iran on one hand and its status as a NATO member and EU candidate on the other allow Ankara to act as a bridge between Tehran and the West.

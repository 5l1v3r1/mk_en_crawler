BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc announced on Wednesday (August 5th) that the cabinet is preparing radical measures affecting the public sector, including cutting as many as 9,200 workers. 
After meeting with IMF officials, Boc also announced that the cabinet will cut the number of state agencies by more than half -- from 226 to 107. 
The government also plans to introduce standard expenditures in four sectors -- public administration, social assistance, health and education -- to eliminate discrepancies in personnel expenses among those working at the various ministries. 
Cabinet ministers will determine the deadline for this action.

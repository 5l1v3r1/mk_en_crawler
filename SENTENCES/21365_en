ZAGREB, Croatia -- A surgeon received a nine-year prison sentence Monday (August 25th) for taking bribes from patients, in the biggest corruption case to rock the country's health system. 
A court convicted Ognjen Simic, a cardiac surgeon at a state hospital in Rijeka, of taking money from 18 patients in exchange for helping them receive urgent surgery. 
Simic also lost the right to practice medicine for a period of five years and must return the money. 
Prosecutors say he took around 40,000 euros from patients over the course of six years.

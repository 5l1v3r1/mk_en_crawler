HACHIBEKTAS, Turkey -- Secularism should be the basis of national unity, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said Saturday (16 August) at a ceremony honouring medieval scholar Hadji Bektash. 
Sezer added that social, economic, political and legal order could not be based on religious rule if Turkey wants to progress and join the EU. 
Union officials have warned several times that secular rule is a major prerequisite for membership. 
Sezer echoed that view, saying that "holy feelings cannot be included in state affairs".

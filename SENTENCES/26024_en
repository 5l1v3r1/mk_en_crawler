SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Police filed charges Monday (August17th) against eight fans of the national league soccer team Vardar who clashed Sunday with local Albanians in Skopje.
Seven people were injured and several cars were damaged in the violence started by Vardar's fans after their team suffered a 0-5 loss to Macedonia Gjorce Petrov.
The violence prompted reaction across the political spectrum.
A spokesperson for Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska stressed it will not be tolerated.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski condemned it as unacceptable.
The opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia demanded the immediate arrest and punishment of those responsible.
The Democratic Party of Albanians said the incident proves the government cares little about ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and does nothing to protect them.

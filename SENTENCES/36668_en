PARIS, France -- President Jacques Chirac met with Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on Friday (30 April).
Nastase said his country would continue to count on France's support in meeting its EU accession timetable.
In other developments, Romania's National Customs Authority announced Friday that the country would modify its import and export tariffs for the ten new EU member states.
Romanian goods exported to the ten countries and imports from those states will benefit from the preferential tariff established by the European Agreement for Romania.

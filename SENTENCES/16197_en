SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The campaign for the 5 July parliamentary vote in Macedonia officially began Thursday (15 June).
The State Election Commission (SEC) adopted rules Wednesday for the vote, including procedures for ballot counting and public procurement.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church urged all parties and church faithful Wednesday to demonstrate peaceful, democratic and dignified behaviour during the elections.
The Islamic community issued a similar message a few weeks ago.
Also Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski presented a report on the activities of the current legislature.
He noted that in the past four years, parliament adopted some 800 new laws, playing a key role in the country's European integration process.
Next week, Jordanovski becomes Macedonia's ambassador to the United States.

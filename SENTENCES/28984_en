BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Parliament approved the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia at a session Monday (November 8th) by a vote of 315-2, with 43 abstentions. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Zsolt Nemeth described it as a reassuring message to Serbia but one that does not guarantee Serbia's entry into the bloc. 
Belgrade submitted its membership application last December and hopes to receive candidate status in the second half of 2011, which would allow the government to start membership negotiations in 2012.

BEIJING, China -- The foreign ministry says a 12-member team of policemen will be dispatched to Kosovo in the coming days, part of Beijing's commitment to increase its presence in UN-led missions. 
The officers will join the UN police force in Kosovo.
In other news, Janice Biggs, a US corrections officer who was wounded in a shooting in Kosovo on 18 April, says she wants to return to the province. 
She was one of 11 officers injured when a Jordanian policeman, also serving with the UN mission, opened fire on a convoy of vehicles carrying US wardens in Mitrovica. 
Three were killed in the barrage.

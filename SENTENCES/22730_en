TIRANA, Albania -- Corruption in Albania was 13% higher last year compared with 2006, according to a USAID-financed survey conducted by the Research Institute and published on Wednesday (May 7th). 
Around 60% of those surveyed said that they did not trust the country's judicial system as a top institution meant to fight corruption. 
Participants in the poll also criticised the government, political parties and trade unions. 
US Ambassador John Withers said changes are needed to the law on immunity that would permit investigations into every official.

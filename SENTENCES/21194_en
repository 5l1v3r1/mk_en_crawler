MOSCOW, Russia -- Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko was chosen on Tuesday (July 31st) to represent Russia in the Contact Group Troika that will mediate negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina regarding the future status of Kosovo. 
Botsan-Kharchenko, the Foreign Ministry's special representative for the Balkans, reiterated Moscow's stand that both Belgrade and Pristina's views must be taken into account in the talks, and that the final status should not be pre-determined. 
He is expected to meet this week with EU representative Wolfgang Ischinger and with US representative Frank Wisner about the negotiations process.
The 120 days of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina will begin after UN General-Secretary Ban Ki-moon announces the start day.

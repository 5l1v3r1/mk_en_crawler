BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Despite the general political agreement reached on forming a new government in Republika Srpska (RS), the entity's main parties still have not come up with a joint nominee for the post of prime minister. 
The leaders of six large parties met on Monday (27 December), but RS President Dragan Cavic said they had rejected his proposal to give the mandate to one of the minor formations, the Democratic People's Union, which he said could play a mediating role. 
On Wednesday, the RS Parliament meets to confirm the resignation of Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic's government, following sanctions earlier this month imposed by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, the BiH presidency, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and leaders of the main BiH parliamentary powers held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss related resignations of some state cabinet members.

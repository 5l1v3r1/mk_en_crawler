BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In a statement released on Friday (December 28th), EU security chief Javier Solana congratulated the successful completion of the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) in the Western Balkans. 
The EUMM, which was deployed in 2001, was tasked with observing political and security-related developments in the region. 
It will be officially dissolved on Monday.
"The EUMM was there through the most difficult years, but since then all the countries of the region have made significant progress," Solana said. 
"A new perspective has now opened for the Western Balkans -- peace and stability have been restored." He pledged that the EU would continue to support the region's development and integration prospects.

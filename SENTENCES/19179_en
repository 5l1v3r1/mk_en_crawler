SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The two top Bosniak leaders in BiH, Haris Silajdzic and Sulejman Tihic, have rejected a new police reform proposal by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak.
At a joint press conference Thursday (August 30th), they said the draft legalises the current police structure and preserves the Republika Srpska police.
Lajcak did not hide his disappointment with Silajdzic and Tihic.
"By rejecting the draft proposal ...
before all the major political leaders have even received it, they have demonstrated a disdain for their colleagues and the political process," he said.
On Friday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Ollie Rehn criticised them as well, reiterating that police reform is crucial to a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union.

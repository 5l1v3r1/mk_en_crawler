ATHENS, Greece -- A team of experts from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the IMF arrives in Athens on Tuesday (May 3rd) to discuss the release of the fifth tranche of the 110 billion-euro bailout package Greece received last May. 
The tranche is in the amount of 12 billion euros. 
Meanwhile, Finance Minister George Papaconstantionou said in an interview Monday that his country would prefer an extension of its debt repayment scheme over debt restructuring, an option that has been suggested by some experts recently. 
"It would be better for us to extend once again the timing of repayment of the 110 billion that we're borrowing from our partners and that we further reduce the interest rate," Papaconstantinou told the French daily Liberation.

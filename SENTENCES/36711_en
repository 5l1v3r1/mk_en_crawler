ZAGREB, Croatia -- Winemakers and hoteliers are protesting a new law that would make any amount of alcohol in the blood of drivers punishable, local media reported Tuesday (27 July). 
They are calling for a return to the previous alcohol limit of 0.05 per cent, arguing that this is the norm in most other countries, including France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. 
Travel industry executives warn that the new law would discourage tourism and prevent guests from having "a customary and normal glass of wine after lunch". 
The Catholic Church also opposes the law because of the use of wine during Mass.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Adnan Terzic predicted on Sunday (October1st) that an upcoming report by the European Commission (EC) on BiH would give a negative assessment of the country's readiness to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
"The information that we have obtained suggests that the EC would not recommend the sealing of the accord, primarily because of the blockage of the police reform," he told a news conference in Sarajevo.
A BiH government delegation visited Brussels last week.
Meanwhile, the outgoing EC Ambassador to BiH, Michael Humphreys, said on Sunday that constitutional changes agreed on by the main parties must be adopted immediately after the ongoing elections process is completed.
He too cited the restructuring of the police sector as a priority.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Mihai Stanisoara on Wednesday (August 26th) denied allegations that his ministry participated in deals to smuggle explosives. 
Opposition National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu threatened on Tuesday to call for an inquiry into the case, which involves Mircea Basescu, brother of President Traian Basescu. 
Journalist Sorin Rosca Stanescu made the allegations on his blog, writing that Mircea Basescu, who works in a weapon and military consulting company, was part of an international operation trafficking huge amounts of explosives. 
Basescu denied the story on Monday, insisting "I am not and I have never been involved in trade operations of this kind." (Xinhua, Hotnews.ro, Mediafax - 26/08/09)

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a resolution Tuesday (15 November) on combating corruption, ruling that the legislature's institutional role in handling corruption-related issues must increase. 
The document also envisions better communication between parliament, the government, and prosecutors regarding alleged corruption cases. 
It also stresses the need for serious reform of the state intelligence structure SHISH in order to strengthen anti-corruption efforts. 
The resolution passed after heated debate between the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition, which says DP cited corruption as a pretext for putting political pressure on some state institutions.

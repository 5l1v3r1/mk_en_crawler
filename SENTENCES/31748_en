SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The General Secretary of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), Gzim Ostreni, called on Wednesday (8 January) for efficient and timely implementation of the Ohrid peace accords. 
During a meeting with ethnic Albanians from the city of Debar, he also appealed for full compliance with Macedonia's Constitution and stressed that DUI's main goal would be equal representation in all segments of the state system.
In other news, the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE is expected to decide in one week whether to stop boycotting parliamentary work, according to spokesman Vladimir Gjorcev. 
Party members stopped attending sessions two months ago, due in part to DUI's presence.

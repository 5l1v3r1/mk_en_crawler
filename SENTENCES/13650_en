ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt confirmed on Friday (20 January) that Zagreb is preparing a formal request for the extradition of a former Serb militia commander, Dragan Vasiljkovic, from Australia.
Authorities there had detained him earlier the same day on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia.
It accuses Vasljkovic, also known as "Captain Dragan", of crimes committed against Croatian prisoners of war and civilians in Croatia and BiH from 1991-1995.
According to Skare-Ozbolt, the extradition motion will be filed immediately after the Sibenik court, which first began the legal procedure, submits all relevant documents.

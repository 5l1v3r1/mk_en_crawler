SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leaders of the three biggest parties in Macedonia -- the ruling VMRO-DPMNE's Nikola Gruevski, the opposition Social Democratic Alliance's Zoran Zaev and the ruling ethnic-Albanian Democratic Union for Integration's Ali Ahmeti -- urged all voters Tuesday (March 31st) to turn out for the presidential runoff and local elections on Sunday. 
After a meeting of the three leaders, Gruevski predicted that the second round of the presidential election will be at least as successful as the first round was on March 22nd.

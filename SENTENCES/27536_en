TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE media freedoms chief Dunja Mijatovic criticised on Tuesday (June 29th) a decision by a Tirana court that found local Top Channel TV guilty of "illegal filming" and "breaching privacy".
The station was ordered to pay 400,000 euros after broadcasting a video of former Culture Minister Ylli Pango, in which he demands sex in exchange for employment at his ministry in March 2009.
The fine is high and disproportional, Mijatovic said.
The court's decision also spurred sharp reaction among local media, which questioned the judges' professionalism.

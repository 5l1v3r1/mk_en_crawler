ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Hague-based UN war crimes tribunal issued new indictments Wednesday (27 April) against four Croats. 
The first two are Markica Rebic, who headed the Security Information Service, and Ivica Marijacic, a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Zagreb-based weekly newspaper Hrvatski List. 
They were indicted for breaching court secrets by publishing a statement made by a protected witness. 
The second indictment contains similar charges against Stjepan Seselj, publisher of the Zagreb-based weekly publication Hrvatsko Slovo, and its editor, Domagoj Margetic. 
According to prosecutors, all of them were aware that disclosing the identity of a witness and his testimony is illegal. 
If convicted, they face up to seven years in prison or fines of 100,000 euros.

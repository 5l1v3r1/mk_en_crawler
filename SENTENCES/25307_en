PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A Slovenian soldier serving with KFOR in Kosovo has died in what appears to be an accidental shooting, the Slovenian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday (November 24th). 
Although the incident is under investigation, it is believed that it did not "imply the involvement of another person" the ministry said. 
Slovenia joined the KFOR peacekeepers in 2007.

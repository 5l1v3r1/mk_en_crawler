BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police on Monday (April 27th) arrested drug baron Sreten Jocic, suspected of plotting last year's murder of Croatian journalist Ivo Pukanic.
A car bomb killed Pukanic and a colleague on October 23rd 2008 in front of their office at the magazine, Nacional, in downtown Zagreb.
Following Jocic's detention, 30 anti-terror police officers raided his home.
Croatian authorities reportedly have not requested Jocic's extradition, as Serbian laws ban extraditions of citizens to another state.
Croatian police spokesperson Krunoslav Borovec described Jocic's arrest as the result of joint efforts by prosecutors and the interior ministries of the two countries.
Serbian media reported on Monday that Jocic might also be linked to a recent double murder.
The charred bodies of two men turned up in a jeep near the Serbian village of Dobanovci on Friday.
Both victims had criminal pasts.
Jocic may also have recent links to Bulgarian politics.
He told the district court in Belgrade earlier this month that, while he was in Bulgaria, former Interior Ministry Secretary General and current Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov, whose party, GERB, is currently the most popular in the country, requested his services.
Borisov denies Jocic's claim.

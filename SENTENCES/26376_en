TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party's (SP) two month-long parliamentary boycott does not hinder the visa liberalisation that Albania is seeking in 2010, Prime Minister Sali Berisha told lawmakers Thursday (November 12th).
He reiterated that the majority is ready to establish a parliamentary panel to look into the SP's demands.
The SP insists the June general elections were "manipulated" and says the boycott will continue until an investigation is conducted.
A crack in the party surfaced Thursday when five SP lawmakers invited colleagues to quit the boycott for the sake of EU integration reforms and return to parliament next week.

PARIS, France -- State Secretary for European Affairs Jean-Pierre Jouyet said the EU will open two new chapters in Turkey's EU membership talks at an EU-Turkish intergovernmental conference scheduled for December 18th, media reported on Thursday (October 30th).
Current EU presidency holder France wanted to open more than that, but developments beyond its control might block it from opening a third chapter, Jouyet said during a reception in Paris marking the 85th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey's founding.
Also Thursday, media reported the European Commission's (EC) annual progress report on Turkey due next week would recommend the country speed up efforts to implement pro-EU reforms.
The EC will praise Turkey for improving its relations with Armenia and for trying to stabilise the Caucasus, as well as for undertaking some economic reforms.
The report is also expected for the first time to describe Turkey as a functioning market economy.

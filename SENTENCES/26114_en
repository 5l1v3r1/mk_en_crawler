PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Deputy Ambassador to Pristina Michael Murphy on Tuesday (October 13th) urged Kosovo Serbs to participate in the upcoming November 15th municipal elections.
Murphy was speaking at the inauguration of a 3km section of roadway in the Serb-dominated village of Bushince, in eastern Kosovo, built with US financial assistance.
"I encourage you to use your vote;
I encourage you to take part and from day to day to have control and regulate your lives yourselves," Murphy said.
Next month's municipal elections are the first since Kosovo declared independence in February 2008.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Monday (4 October) that she expects Serbia to arrest Ratko Mladic and other war crimes indictees within days or weeks.
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, she insisted that Mladic was still hiding in Serbia and that none of the officials she met had been able to prove the opposite.
Del Ponte added that she had received assurances from Kostunica that Serbia would co-operate fully with the UN tribunal.
The prosecutor is due to brief the UN Security Council in November.
She signalled that she expects evidence of Serbia's co-operation by then.

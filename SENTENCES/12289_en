HELSINKI, Finland -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Friday (8 April) that there is no link between Turkey's bid for membership in the Union and potential problems with the adoption of the EU Constitution. 
He signalled that the launching of accession talks with Ankara would not be affected by the outcome of a French referendum scheduled for 29 May. 
The constitution would take effect only if it is approved by all member-states.

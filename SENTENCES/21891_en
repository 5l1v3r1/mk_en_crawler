ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin says Turkey is considering ending the solitary confinement of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
He has been serving a life sentence in a prison on the island of Imrali since his arrest and conviction in 1999.
On Friday (November 21st), Sahin said authorities have started building a new detention facility on the island where five or six other detainees could be transferred.
In March, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture called on Turkey to end Ocalan's isolation after representatives who visited him expressed concern over his mental health.
In other news Friday, PKK members bombed the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline in the southeastern Mardin province, officials from the energy ministry said.
The attack caused a large fire and halted oil exports.
The PKK claimed responsibility for the bombing Saturday.

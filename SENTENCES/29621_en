ANKARA, Turkey -- Workers began demolishing a statue Tuesday (April 26th) in the eastern city of Kars symbolising friendship between Armenia and Turkey. 
The decision to bring down the monument, consisting of two 30m-high concrete figures, has sparked heated debate after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently described it as a "monstrosity" and called for its destruction. 
Demolition work began in the presence of riot police who were dispatched to prevent possible skirmishes with protestors.

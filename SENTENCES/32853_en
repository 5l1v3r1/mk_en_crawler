SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Monday (2 December), High Representative Paddy Ashdown imposed a new law intended to streamline the BiH central government and enhance its powers.
Two new ministries - Security and Justice - will be established and the prime minister will serve a fixed four-year term.
Until now representatives of the Muslims, Croats and Serbs alternated at the post every eight months, slowing decision-making.
The law generally follows an agreement reached last week among the parties in parliament, Ashdown said, responding to criticism from Republika Srpska.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government criticised on Tuesday (25 March) a draft report about Turkey, presented to the European Parliament by Dutch rapporteur Arie Oostlander. 
Describing the Turkish Army as the most trusted institution in the country, he suggested its role impedes development of a truly pluralistic democracy. 
Turkish Foreign Ministry acting spokesman Huseyin Dirioz responded that such conclusions are subjective and far from productive.

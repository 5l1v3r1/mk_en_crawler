BELGRADE, Serbia -- The director of the Tanjug state news agency, Luka Miceta, resigned on Wednesday (June 18th), a month before his term was to end. 
Miceta has held the post since 2003. 
By law, the managing board, appointed by the government, elects the head of Tanjug.
In other news Wednesday, the South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) contended that the media remain under constant pressure from political parties and owners of major capital. 
At a presentation of SEEMO's assessment in Belgrade, Zeljko Ivanovic, co-owner of the Podgorica-based daily newspaper Vijesti, said journalism nowadays is even more difficult than it was in the 1990s under Slobodan Milosevic's regime.

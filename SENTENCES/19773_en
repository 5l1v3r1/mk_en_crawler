BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte met with officials in Belgrade on Thursday (September 20th) to discuss documents Serbia must turn over to The Hague tribunal. 
She told Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that the country must fulfil its duties and bring all remaining war crimes fugitives to justice as soon as possible. 
Del Ponte also met with Rasim Ljajic, head of the Serbian national council for ties with the UN, to discuss overall co-operation with the tribunal. 
The report del Ponte will prepare for the European Commission on Serbia's level of co-operation will be generally positive, according to Belgrade's B92. 
Co-operation with UN prosecutors is a key condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia.
In other news, joint action by Serbian and Kosovo police has uncovered a plot to supply Serbian Muslim extremists with weapons. 
According to unofficial reports, an arms dealer has been arrested in Mitrovica for selling arms to terror suspects in Serbia's southern region of Sandzak. 
Serbian police raided what was described as a terrorist training camp last June, seizing a large quantity of ammunition and explosives.

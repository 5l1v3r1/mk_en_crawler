NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greece and Greek Cypriots believe that the period between January and May 2004 will be crucial for solving disputes concerning the divided island, Cypriot government spokesman Kipros Chrisostomidis said Monday (21 July).
The period immediately precedes Cyprus' accession into the EU.
Chrisostomidis added that Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos plans to meet with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the sidelines of the next UN General Assembly session, though a firm date has not been set.

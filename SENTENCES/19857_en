SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The legal committee of the BiH House of Representatives approved a long-awaited package of police reforms Monday (February 18th) and forwarded it to parliament for debate.
The committee found that the draft laws on the Directorate for Co-ordination of Police Bodies and Agencies and the Independent and Supervisory Bodies of the Police Structure of BiH fully comply with the BiH Constitution.
Police reform and restructuring remains a key condition to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, possibly by July.
The largest Bosniak party -- the Party of Democratic Action -- and the main opposition party in Republika Srpska -- the Serb Democratic Party -- still have reservations about the draft.
Nevertheless, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said last week he is confident it would survive the state-level parliament with support from the five other ruling coalition parties and some opposition parties.

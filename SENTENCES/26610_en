THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- During the second week of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, the US, Russia, Spain and Finland presented their arguments Tuesday (December 8th).
Spain is the only Western country that opposes Kosovo's independence, insisting that Pristina's declaration of independence was not supported by any existing provision of international law. 
As Madrid seems unwilling to recognise Kosovo, Pristina could face difficulties in formal relations with the EU and NATO.
Russia's arguments are along the same lines as Spain, insisting that the court should consider that many declarations have been declared illegal in the past. 
"North Cyprus is such an example," said Russian Ambassador to the Netherlands Kirill Gevorgian.
Speaking in favour of Kosovo's independence was US representative Harold Hongju Koh. 
"Our response is yes. 
Kosovo declared independence and respected international law," he said, adding it was a political action based on the will of the people.
Finland echoed that sentiment, saying "People determine the fate of the territory ... 
the territory does not determine the fate of people." (Koha Ditore, Lajm, Express, BBC, Kosova Sot - 09/12/09)

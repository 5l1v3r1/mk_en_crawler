THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Former Bosniak military commander Naser Oric is asking the UN tribunal that acquitted him of war crimes to order Republika Srpska's (RS) authorities to halt a new probe against him.
In a motion Thursday (December 11th), Oric claimed RS authorities want to prosecute him, despite an article in the tribunal's statute that says no one can be tried before a domestic court for acts already adjudicated by the UN tribunal.
In July, The Hague tribunal acquitted him of failing to prevent the murder and inhumane treatment of Serb prisoners in Srebrenica from 1992 to 1993.
In other news Thursday, the tribunal rejected retired Yugoslav Army General Vladimir Lazarevic's request for a temporary release due to health reasons.
Along with former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and four others, Lazarevic is accused of forcefully relocating, deporting, killing and persecuting Albanians in Kosovo during the first six months of 1999.
He is currently in custody at The Hague awaiting a verdict in his trial, which ended in August.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The appointment of Romanian Colonel Marian Petre as head of the EULEX Special Police Unit has prompted reactions and requests for EULEX to cancel the decision. 
Vetevendosje Movement, the second biggest opposition parliamentary group, wrote to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Tuesday (April 26th) seeking a cancellation of Petre's appointment. 
Romanian police officers deployed with UNMIK were held responsible for firing rubber bullets into a crowd of Pristina protestors in February 2007, killing two Vetevendosje activists and injuring 80 others. 
Vetevendosje adds in the letter that since the Romanians have not apologised for the incident, the appointment is considered a serious insult to the people of Kosovo. 
The Council for Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms (CDHRF) says this appointment would be acceptable, had the Romanian police officer's colleagues been prosecuted for killing the two protestors -- Mon Balaj and Arben Xheladini. 
Meanwhile, Selim Krasniqi, political adviser at the Ministry of Security Forces (KSF), objects because Romania has not recognised Kosovo's independence. 
EULEX spokesperson Blerim Krasniqi says Petre was "appointed based on his professionalism, not based on which country he comes from".

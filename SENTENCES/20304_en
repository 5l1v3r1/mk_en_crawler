BELGRADE, Serbia -- Kosovo is neither ready for democracy nor prepared for the establishment of a multiethnic society, Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Monday (August 13th).
He was marking the 4th anniversary of the killing of two Serbian youngsters in Pec.
They were shot dead as they swam in the Bistrica river.
Tadic said that in the four years since the murders of Ivan Jovovic, 19, and Pantelija Dakic, 12, and the wounding of four boys in Gorajdevac, the assailants had not been caught.
Tadic urged Albanian leaders in Kosovo to get involved in the case and to prevent the spread of extremism within their ranks.
Stefan Feller, UN police commissioner in Kosovo, has said that "no stone would remain unturned to find the killers".
A $1m reward has been offered to anyone with information about the case.

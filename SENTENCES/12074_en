NEW YORK, United States -- UN Environment Programme Executive Director Klaus Toepfer on Sunday (15 May) praised the announcement of a new strategy to reduce mining risks in Southeast Europe, agreed upon during a weekend regional conference in Romania. 
The document addresses threats to the environment posed by mining and related industries, particularly threats posed by numerous old and abandoned sites in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo. 
The plan, agreed upon on Saturday, is expected to result in detailed assessments and an early warning system for key rivers with chronic pollution.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Public Prosecutor Aleksander Prcevski announced on Tuesday (16 November) that he wants to talk to outgoing Prime Minister Hari Kostov about comments he made suggesting corruption and nepotism in government. 
In a statement issued earlier this week, Kostov said his resignation was triggered in part by political interference and corruption, implying that one of the coalition partners, the Democratic Union for Integration, was mostly to blame.
In other news, Skopje on Wednesday began hosting the biannual meetings of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe. 
The three-day forum includes roundtables on democratisation and human rights, economic reconstruction, security development and co-operation.
On Tuesday, meanwhile, Macedonian Interior Minister Siljan Avramovski paid a visit to Tirana. 
Talks with Public Order Minister Igli Tosca focused on fighting cross-border crime. 
One proposal would be launching joint border patrols.

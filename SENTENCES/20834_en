SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The directors of police forces in Macedonia and Kosovo agreed on Monday (November 5th) to boost efforts against criminal gangs trying to capitalise on rising tensions associated with efforts to resolve Kosovo's final status. 
During a meeting in Skopje, interior ministry official Ljupco Todorovski and the head of the Kosovo police, General Sheremet Ahmeti, exchanged intelligence information on the movement and activities of these groups. 
Todorovski also supplied information about Xhavid Morina, an inmate who escaped from Kosovo's maximum security Dubrava prison in August. 
He was killed in a gunfight last week in a village near Tetovo.
In other news Monday, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki met with German Ambassador to NATO Ulrich Brandenburg. 
They agreed that the membership of Macedonia, Albania and Croatia in NATO would boost the Alliance's security in Southeast Europe. 
The more Balkan countries there are in NATO, the less NATO there will be in the Balkans, they said.
Also Monday, Macedonian Defence Minister Lazar Elenoski was in Washington, where he discussed ongoing reforms with officials from the Pentagon and the state department.

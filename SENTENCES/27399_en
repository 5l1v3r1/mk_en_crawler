SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Supreme Court of Cassation on Monday (August 30th) sentenced two men to prison in a murder trial that has dragged on for a decade.
Georgi Zhelyazkov and Stoyan Stoichkov received prison sentences of 19 and 17 years respectively for stabbing to death Bulgarian student Martin Borilski in Paris in 2000.
The court's ruling is final and cannot be appealed.
A ruling last year acquitted the pair.
France challenged it, arguing that Bulgarian authorities have failed to take into account evidence provided by Paris investigators.

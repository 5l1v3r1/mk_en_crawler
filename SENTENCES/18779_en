ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Cemil Cicek rejected on Monday (March 5th) recent claims that the jailed leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, has been systemically poisoned.
Cicek described the accusations, made by Ocalan's lawyers, as "complete lies" and said the government has sent a three-member medical team, including a toxicologist, to examine him.
Ocalan is serving a life sentence on Imrali island near Istanbul for his role in the PKK's armed rebellion against Ankara's rule.

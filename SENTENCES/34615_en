BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament adopted a resolution on Wednesday (27 August) describing Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia.
It said that all clauses in UN Security Council Resolution 1244 must be enforced before any status talks begin.
The document also calls for the return of Serbs who fled the province after the end of the 1999 conflict, and urges the international community to step up efforts to curb violence, facilitate refugee return and build institutions.
The resolution drew fire from Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi said such acts are bound to raise tensions.
A UN spokeswoman responded to the resolution by saying that the future of Kosovo lies solely in the hands of the UN Security Council.

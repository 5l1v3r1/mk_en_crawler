BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a resolution Tuesday (June 1st) that calls for easing ethnic tensions and urges Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) leaders to be more responsible regarding the country's EU future.
Though members backed a proposal to lift visa requirements for BiH citizens, they also voiced disappointment over the limited progress the country has made in its EU integration process and called for the strengthening of central authority and an end to nationalism.
"The use of inflammatory language and the nationalistic and secessionist rhetoric, which undermine relations among the Serb, Muslim and Croat communities and the functioning of the central state must stop," the document stated.
Doris Pack, a member of the EP delegation for Southeast Europe, said there is no alternative to constitutional reforms in BiH.

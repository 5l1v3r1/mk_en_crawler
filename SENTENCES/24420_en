ZAGREB, Croatia -- The interior ministry announced rewards Wednesday (April 8th) for information about two men suspected of murdering journalist Ivo Pukanic in Zagreb last October.
He was the owner and editor-in-chief of Croatia's leading political weekly, Nacional.
Anyone who provides useful information leading to the arrest of suspects Zeljko Milovanovic and Bojan Guduric will receive 100,000 kunas (13,560 euros).
Three alleged co-conspirators are already behind bars in Zagreb, charged with the car bombing that killed Pukanic and colleague Niko Franjic on October 23rd.
The ministry believes Milovanovic and Guduric are hiding in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia, making members of the public there also eligible for the rewards.
Milovanovic holds dual Croatian-Bosnian citizenship, while Guduric has a Serbian passport.

TIRANA, Albania -- As the summer tourism season begins, the government has decided to move families displaced by blasts in the village of Gerdec from their temporary shelters to a state vacation resort in Durres. 
An estimated 3,000 people lost their homes to the deadly March 15th explosions at an ammunitions depot in Gerdec.
On Monday (June 2nd), the Vlora municipality, where Gerdec is located, began distributing a monthly allowance of 200 euros to all displaced families. 
Last week, Albanian authorities organised a meeting with representatives of international institutions in Tirana asking for help in rebuilding the Gerdec area. 
The EU promises assistance for education, healthcare, infrastructure development and agriculture but warns that no family should return until the area is cleared of unexploded ammunition.

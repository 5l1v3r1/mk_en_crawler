SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government announced on Wednesday (October 17th) that several companies have submitted initial bids for the purchase of a 49% stake in the planned nuclear power plant at Belene on the Danube. 
The new plant is expected to cost around 4 billion euros and will offset the closing of four old reactors at the Kozloduy plant in recent years. 
Italy's Enel SpA, Electricite de France, Suez's Electrabel, Germany's E.ON AG and RWE AG and Czech company CEZ have submitted bids.

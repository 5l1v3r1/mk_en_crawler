SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) kicked off a meeting in Sarajevo on Wednesday (March 25th), by welcoming passage of the Brcko amendment to the BiH Constitution by the House of Representatives. 
The PIC said it considers this a sign that the country can make progress when political leaders choose to compromise. 
Resolving the status of the Brcko District is one of the conditions needed for closing the Office of the High Representative.
In other news Wednesday, leaders of the main BiH parties -- the Party of Democratic Action's Sulejman Tihic, Union of Independent Social Democrats' Milorad Dodik, and Croatian Democratic Union of BiH's Dragan Covic -- agreed to continue constitutional reform efforts. 
They said they have authorised the caucuses of the three parties to start consulting with other parties in parliament, based on the principles of the November agreement signed in Prud.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Franko Simatovic, the former Serbian chief of police special operations, appeared before the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (2 June) and plead not guilty to four counts of war crimes and one count of crimes against humanity.
Simatovic is accused of setting up paramilitary units which engaged in ethnic cleansing campaigns during the 1991-1995 conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia.
The case could have serious implications for the trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
If prosecutors can prove their case against Simatovic, they will have established a link between the Serbian government and the paramilitaries operating in BiH and Croatia.
Milosevic has denied that he was in control of these units.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe, said on Thursday (April 29th) that Turkey's Constitutional Court should play a limited role in deciding the constitutionality of amendments recently approved by parliament.
Speaking to the Turkish newspaper Zaman, Thomas Markert, secretary-general of the Venice Commission, noted there would be a conflict of interest if the Court intervenes in constitutional amendments that would impact its composition and procedures.
Parliament begins a second reading of all 30 amendments at the weekend, clearing the way for debate and voting next week.
The ruling Justice and Development Party is driving the process, while the main opposition Republican People's Party intends to challenge the amendments before the Constitutional Court, if necessary.

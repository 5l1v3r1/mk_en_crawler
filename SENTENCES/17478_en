SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Negotiation teams from BiH and the European Commission (EC) co-ordinated the texts Tuesday (January 30th) of draft agreements on visa relaxation and readmission. 
Bakir Dautbasic, BiH's lead negotiator, announced the news after two days of talks in Brussels. 
BiH must now wait for finalisation of parallel talks between the EC and the other Western Balkan states -- Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. 
The EU Council will then endorse all the agreements in early March, sending them on to the EU member states for ratification.

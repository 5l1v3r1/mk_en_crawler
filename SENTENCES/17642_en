TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama on Wednesday (July 25th) expelled former leader Fatos Nano from the top ranks, blaming him for Prime Minister Sali Berisha's prolonged stay in power. 
"Nano's bargain just lengthened the stay," Rama told SP's national congress, after Nano acknowledged that he had urged six SP lawmakers to abandon their boycott during the vote for a new president last week. 
That led to the election of Bamir Topi, deputy head of Berisha's Democratic Party. 
Nano says he will form a new political movement in September.

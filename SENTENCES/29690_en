SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board wrapped up two days of meetings in Sarajevo on Wednesday (March 30th) expressing deep concern that six months after the October 3rd general elections, BiH still has no government.
"This is the time for political leaders to demonstrate â¦ realism, constructive compromise and political will," the PIC said in its concluding statement.
Cautious about commenting on the situation in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), PIC members expressed support for High Representative Valentin Inzko's actions and called for the rapid resolution of legal issues surrounding the creation of the entity's new government.
In other news Wednesday, FBiH's Constitutional Court halted the review on the legitimacy of the entity's new authorities.
The decision came after the entity's outgoing president, Borjana Kristo, withdrew her complaint against the formation of the upper house of parliament and election of president and vice-presidents.

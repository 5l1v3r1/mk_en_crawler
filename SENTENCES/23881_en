ANKARA, Turkey -- The country plans to translate the Koran, the central religious text of Islam, into Kurdish as part of ongoing efforts to boost the rights of Kurds and implement the EU's political standards, the local Religious Affairs Directorate General announced on Wednesday (March 18th).
"We don't want to exclude the Kurdish language in the preparation of translation of the Koran in other languages," said Mehmet Gormez, deputy president of the directorate.
Between 12 million and 14 million Kurds live in Turkey, but use of their language in political speeches and official correspondence is still forbidden.
After implementing reforms aimed at boosting its EU bid, Ankara increased the cultural and political rights of the Kurdish minority, in part by establishing a Kurdish state television channel.

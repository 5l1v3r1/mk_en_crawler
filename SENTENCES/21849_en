ATHENS, Greece -- A far-left group calling itself Anti-Democratic Struggle has claimed responsibility for two arson attacks Friday (April 18th) that targeted cars owned by the embassies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey in Athens.
Though the vehicles were badly damaged, no injuries were reported.
Earlier this month, two cars owned by the embassy of Saudi Arabia were torched in two separate incidents.

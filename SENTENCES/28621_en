BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet's future is on the line Tuesday (June 15th), as it faces a vote of no confidence required by the fast-track option it chose for pushing through a series of unpopular austerity measures.
The spending cuts, totalling about 2.3% of GDP, include a 25% reduction in salaries of public sector employees, a 15% cut in pensions and unemployment benefits.
The measures, hammered out with the IMF, are a condition for Bucharest to receive the next tranche of its 13 billion-euro stand-by arrangement with the Fund.
The ruling coalition needs the support of at least 236 parliament members to survive.
Thousands of labour union members from across the country gathered outside the parliament building ahead of Tuesday's vote to demonstrate against the austerity measures.

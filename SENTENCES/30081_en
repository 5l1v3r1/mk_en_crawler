TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi confirmed that Albania's policy is focused on Europe, during a meeting Thursday (January 20th) with the diplomatic corps in Tirana. 
Topi also focused on the political crisis which has virtually blocked institutional progress since the June 2009 general elections. 
"Important laws were not passed in the parliament in absence of dialogue, therefore it is important that politics is led by democracy," the president said in a message directed at all parties.

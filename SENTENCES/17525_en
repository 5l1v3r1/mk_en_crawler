ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in the southeast town of Diyarbakir sentenced ten people to life in prison Monday (June 25th) for a series of bombings in the early 1990s.
At least 24 people were killed between 1992 and 1994 in attacks aimed at overthrowing the secular government.
All of the defendants were members of the Turkish Hezbollah group.
An 11th suspect was acquitted.
Also Monday, the human rights group Amnesty International complained that the government has frozen its bank accounts in Turkey.
Levent Korkut, the organisation's chief in Turkey, said the measure was imposed because Amnesty published account numbers in its advertising, prompting authorities to accuse it of illegal fundraising.

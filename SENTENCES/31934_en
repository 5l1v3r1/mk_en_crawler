SKOPJE, Macedonia -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner is to visit Skopje Wednesday (27 November) to meet with President Boris Trajkovski, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and others.
Aides say the talks will focus on the border demarcation process between Macedonia and Yugoslavia, a source of controversy.
The Macedonian government decided earlier this week to open two new border checkpoints with Kosovo - at Strezimir and Tanusevci - in a bid to reduce tensions and curb illegal crossings.

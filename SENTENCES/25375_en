PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX says the results of its efforts to shed light on various crimes can be expected in the coming months.
EULEX deputy head Roy Reeve said on Tuesday (December 22nd) that thorough investigations, including co-operation with countries in the region, must be completed in order to resolve cases pending since the days of UNMIK.
"We need full investigations and regional and European countries need to be contacted, since crime does not take place only in Kosovo.
All I can say is that investigations are under way." EULEX and the Ministry of Economy and Finance just signed an agreement to exchange information helpful in fighting corruption, money laundering and organised crime.

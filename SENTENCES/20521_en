ANKARA, Turkey -- As expected, parliament approved in the second and final reading on Saturday (February 9th) two constitutional amendments, allowing women to wear a headscarf in universities, Parliamentary Speaker Koksal Toptan announced. 
The amendments on higher education were supported by 403 of the 550 lawmakers, which was more than the required two-thirds margin. 
Outside, tens of thousands of protestors insisted the amendments would violate the secular principles of the Turkish Republic.

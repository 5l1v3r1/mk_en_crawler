THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- At a pre-trial conference Friday (September 4th), a Trial Chamber confirmed that proceedings against former Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Mico Stanisic and wartime Bosnian Serb Security Service Centre chief Stojan Zupljanin will start on September 14th.
The decision was made despite a request by the defence for a postponement.
Stanisic and Zupljanin are charged with involvement in a joint criminal group between April and late December 1992, aimed at "eliminating and permanently removing Bosnian Muslims and Croats from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina".

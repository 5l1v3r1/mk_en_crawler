THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has granted the temporary release of former Chief of General Staff of the Yugoslav Army Momcilo Perisic, the court announced on Monday (December 7th). 
Perisic, who is charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes committed between 1993 and 1995 during the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, will spend five weeks in Serbia. 
After surrendering to authorities in 2005, his trial at The Hague began in October 2008
In other news Monday, the tribunal rejected a motion submitted by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic who had argued the court has no "legal validity and legitimacy". 
Karadzic, who is charged with 11 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia, filed the motion late last month. 
The court said Karadzic's claim was without merit and advised him to concentrate instead on preparing his defence.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Tuesday (March 23rd) that his country will not return its recalled ambassador to Washington unless the administration and Congress show they are not going to make judgement's on Turkey's history.
Ankara recalled its ambassador for immediate consultations after the US House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a so-called "Armenian genocide" resolution on March 4th.
Ankara had warned that the resolution would harm ties between the two NATO members.

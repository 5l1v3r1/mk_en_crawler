SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR troops searched a forest early Tuesday (April 7th) in an operation aimed at finding more information about the possible whereabouts of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. 
The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague requested the raid in the state-owned forest region near Sarajevo.
On Monday, European Parliament Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin said that Mladic's arrest is an irrevocable condition for unblocking implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) Serbia signed with the EU. 
In Belgrade, Kacin met with Interior Minister Ivica Dacic and Labor and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic. 
Kacin stressed that the EU will not compromise on the issue, despite earlier reports suggesting that some of Serbia's EU backers could convince the Netherlands to scrap its demands for Mladic's arrest before the SAA ratification process begins. 
Kacin added the SAA -- especially its free trade section -- holds much more importance now, given the ongoing economic crisis. 
Ljajic, who also heads the National Council for Co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, said the government "is investing maximum efforts" in finding Mladic as well as fugitive Goran Hadzic.

ATHENS, Greece -- A passenger plane flying with 69 people from Germany to Turkey made an emergency landing at the Thessaloniki airport on Friday (January 22nd) after a bomb threat.
It is believed that the landing was made after a crew member found a note written on a mirror in the restroom reading:
"Bomb.
We are going to die today."
According to another version, an unknown person called the pilot and told him of a bomb on the aircraft.
The plane -- operated by Turkish air carrier Sun Express -- landed safely.

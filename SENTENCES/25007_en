BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament votes Monday (August 31st) on a controversial information law, which would regulate media activities.
Action was postponed a month to allow time to consult with journalists, media associations and European institutions, which reportedly have concerns about the draft.
The Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), a member of the ruling coalition, initially threatened to oppose the bill, but later decided to abstain from voting.
Deputy Prime Minister and G17 Plus leader Mladjan Dinkic said on Sunday he was convinced that the measure will be amended enough to be passed, and told the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti that differences will not lead Serbia towards early elections.

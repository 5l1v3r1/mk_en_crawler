SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chair of the Srebrenica municipal assembly, Radomir Pavlovic, warned on Friday (March 30th) that High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling could impose sanctions if the local parliament adopts a unilateral decision on separation from Republika Srpska (RS).
Pavlovic said he has received a letter from the envoy warning that such a decision would surpass the municipal authority's competencies, as well as breach the RS Constitution and the law on local self-government.
In March, the Bosniak municipal councillors in Srebrenica adopted a resolution calling for the municipality to be removed from the jurisdiction of RS and given a special status within BiH.
In explaining the move, they cited a recent International Court of Justice ruling describing the 1995 Srebrenica killings as genocide.

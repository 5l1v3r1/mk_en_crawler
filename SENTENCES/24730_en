ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police on Thursday (December 4th) said they filed charges against a police officer who allegedly threatened to kill a journalist who covers war crimes committed against Serb civilians in the 1990s.
Journalist Drago Hedl said he received a mobile phone text message last week promising to assassinate him because of his articles on the killing of Serbs in the eastern town of Osijek during the 1991-1995 war in Croatia.
Authorities did not reveal the officer's name, but media reports identify him as Krunoslav Fehir, who was a key witness in the trial of Croatian politician Branimir Glavas.
The former general and commander of the Croatian army in Osijek is on trial for crimes against Serbian civilians in 1991.

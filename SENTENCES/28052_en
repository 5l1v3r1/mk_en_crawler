STRASBOURG, France -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Tuesday (September 21st) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) could join the EU in 2020. 
Inzko, who was speaking to journalists at the European Parliament (EP), said much earlier than that is unlikely. 
"Nine or ten years is a realistic time perspective," he said. 
Inzko also noted that the country must meet several conditions before his office can close and transition into an EU Special Representative office. 
He also confirmed that EU visa requirements for Bosnian citizens could be scrapped by the end of this year.

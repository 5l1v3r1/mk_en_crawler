BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Thursday (23 February) that a "disruption" of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro cannot be avoided, due to Belgrade's failure to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
In a speech to the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Rehn urged Belgrade to meet its remaining obligations, including the arrest of fugitive Ratko Mladic.
Addressing a forum on Euro-Atlantic integration in Belgrade, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said 27 February is the deadline for meeting the remaining obligations to the war crimes tribunal.
Doing so, he said, would clear the way for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Meanwhile, local media in Serbia continue to report that negotiations are under way for Mladic to surrender, with some speculating the fugitive ex-general is ill and ready to turn himself in.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ceremony marking the handover of military command in BiH from SFOR to EUFOR will take place in Sarajevo on 2 December, according to BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic.
After talks Monday (4 October) with international community envoys, Tihic said the BiH presidency would ask the UN Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution.
The envoys reiterated that BiH's lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains a major problem.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A small bomb exploded in front of a pub in Istanbul's busy Bakirkoy district early Friday (28 January), injuring three people and causing minor damage. 
None of the injuries was life-threatening. 
Police believe the device was a percussion bomb designed to make more noise than damage. 
Radical leftist groups have carried out similar attacks in the past.
In other news, a Turkish soldier was killed in the Mardin province when terrorists opened fire on the barracks of a paramilitary unit Thursday. 
Officials blame the attack on KONGRA-GEL.

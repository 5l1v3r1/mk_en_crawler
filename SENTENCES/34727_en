BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian troops deployed in Iraq have established ties with town councils in the area assigned to the battalion, Maj Cristian Teglas reported Friday (15 August). 
Teglas is in charge of relations between the 811th Romanian Infantry Battalion and civilians. 
He added that the local population is largely co-operative. 
The most pressing issue right now, according to Teglas, is the lack of drinking water.

WASHINGTON, United States -- War crimes indictees who do not want to surrender will be arrested, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said during a visit to the United States on Monday (18 April).
He added that arrest warrants have been issued for the fugitives and police are poised to look for them.
"It's now a technical issue, not a political one," Labus said.
In other news, Croatian President Stipe Mesic told local media Monday that he is convinced retired General Ante Gotovina is no longer in Croatia.
Citing a report by the country's security and intelligence services, he insisted that the fugitive is not within the government's reach.
Mesic's comments came days after police launched an investigation into allegations that Gotovina had left Croatia using a false passport issued in 2001.

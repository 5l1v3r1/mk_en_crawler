ZAGREB, Croatia -- Expert teams from Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro held a third regular meeting in Zagreb on Thursday (17 April), focusing on problems with minority rights. 
The leaders of the delegations said they reached consensus on most of the regulation clauses and plan to sign a preliminary agreement for protection of minority rights by summer. 
The new regulations would encourage participation of minorities at the state and local levels. 
Separately, the countries would consider changes in election legislation, in a bid to secure fair rules for participants representing minority groups. 
Bilateral talks started 18 months ago to resolve problems related to home properties, succession of pension rights and a number of other social issues.

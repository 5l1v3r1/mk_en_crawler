BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet decided at a session Wednesday (February 10th) to declassify over 7,000 secret documents related to the country's 1989 anti-communist revolution.
The decision came after the European Court of Human Rights ruled last year that a copy of the documents should be made available to the Association of Revolutionaries.
The documents will be published in that group's official journal.

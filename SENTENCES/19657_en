SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR troops, along with Bosnian Serb police and NATO officials, raided the home of former Bosnian Serb President Mirko Sarovic on Friday (September 21st) looking for clues into the whereabouts of fugitive Radovan Karadzic. 
The raid in Lukavica, a Sarajevo suburb, began at daybreak. 
Sarovic served as the Serb member of BiH's tripartite presidency between October 2002 and April 2003 when he was accused of involvement in illegal sales of military equipment to Iraq. 
He was indicted for abuse of office, forgery, organised crime and helping war crimes fugitives evade justice but was acquitted in 2006.

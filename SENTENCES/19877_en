TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) nominated Gazmend Oketa to the post of defence minister on Thursday (March 20th). 
He has been serving as a deputy prime minister. 
Earlier this week, Fatmir Mediu resigned from office due to the series of deadly blasts at a military ammunition depot in the village of Gerdec. 
The death toll has climbed to 19. 
Prosecutors questioned Mediu on Thursday, in his "capacity as a witness who was aware of the developments". 
He has insisted there were no government violations "as far as contracts with the companies working at the site are concerned".

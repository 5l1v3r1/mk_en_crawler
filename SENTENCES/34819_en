BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several thousand employees in the Banja Luka hospital staged protests in Krajina Square Tuesday (5 August), demanding the resignation of the Republika Srpska government.
They promised bigger rallies in September, saying that only a new government could save the health care sector.
The employees were protesting against delayed wage payments during the last four months, as well as lack of compensation for transport expenses, food and social insurance contributions during the past six to 18 months.
Also Tuesday, the employees of BiH steel plant Zenica warned they would start a general strike on 2 September.
The unionists in the plant demanded higher salaries and new regulations on annual leave.
The plant has 4,645 employees, but nearly a half of them have been forced to take unpaid leave.

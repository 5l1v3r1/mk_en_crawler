The Macedonian Army (ARM) is implementing a Strategic Defence Review aimed at transforming it into a small modern army, in keeping with NATO standards. 
A Joint Operation Command was promoted in Kumanovo on 11 August, ending the operations of the previous Land Army Command.
"The goals that have to be achieved with the formation of the Joint Operation Command derive from the Strategic Defence Review," said Commander Atanas Jovcevski of the Macedonian Land Army. 
"They include establishment of a new organisational structure and termination of some ARM units."
According to Jovcevski, certain units that do not fit into the Joint Operation Command will be dissolved. 
Redeployment of the technical and tangible resources, military equipment and weaponry will follow.
"The Republic of Macedonia is redeploying its resources on behalf of defence and security and in line with its plans for a full NATO membership," ARM Chief of Staff General Miroslav Stojanovski said. 
"We are aware that NATO is changing and we have to adjust to those changes."
Macedonia faces a new strategic setting, including the threats posed by terrorism, and must transform its army in order to meet such challenges, Stojanovski said.
The reserve infantry brigades will be abolished as part of the changes. 
The Strategic Defence Review, which should be implemented by 2007, also provides for transformation of the barracks, facilities and all immovable property, which the Joint Operation Command no longer needs.
One of the major tasks that must be completed is the handover of the Macedonian borders from the ARM to the border police. 
That process is to be completed by 29 August, when control of the country's western border with Albania is transferred.
Along the other borders, the handover is already well under way. 
A total of 1,500 army personnel will join the border police as a result of the change.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader called again on Thursday (May 21st) for Slovenia to stop blocking Croatia's EU accession talks.
Sanader said the two sides could continue negotiations on their border dispute after Croatia's accession negotiations are resumed.
"Croatia will not yield to blackmail [from the Slovenian side]," Sanader told a cabinet meeting, describing the Slovenian government's policy as inconsistent with EU principles.
In response, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor said Zagreb should first withdraw some controversial documents regarding the long-standing border issue it submitted to the European Commission.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn wants international arbitration to resolve the issue.
Croatia backs the proposal, but Slovenia has proposed amendments to it.

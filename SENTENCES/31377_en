SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said Sunday (27 April) that he has not decided whether to accept the resignation of Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Gen Boyko Borissov.
He added the cabinet would discuss the issue within days.
Borissov submitted his resignation Friday, in the wake of a report on organised crime allegedly containing evidence of links with politicians and magistrates.
Early on, Borissov said the report contained pictures of ministers in contact with known criminals, claims that later seemed unsubstantiated.

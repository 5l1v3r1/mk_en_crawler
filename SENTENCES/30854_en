ATHENS, Greece -- EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (December 9th) that Greece will likely get more time to repay a 110 billion-euro emergency loan that the bloc and the IMF provided in May.
"We stand ready to make the concrete proposal early next year, and I'm certain that it will receive the support of EU finance ministers," Rehn said after talks with Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou in Athens.
He added that plans to extend the deadline for repayment to seven and a half years would not be accompanied by new conditions.
Rehn also said he does not believe the country would need a new loan.
Addressing parliament on Thursday, he said that Greece is on the right path in implementing reforms and austerity measures.

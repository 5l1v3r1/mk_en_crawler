BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers officially accepted on Monday (November 16th) Albania's application for candidate status and will now ask the European Commission to present an opinion on Albania's bid, which should take about 18 months. 
Albania filed its candidate status application in April.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha described Monday's decision as "historic and crucial for Albanian citizens", a sentiment echoed by President Bamir Topi who said Albania wants to become part of "United Europe".
Separately Monday, European Parliament Member Tanja Fajon said Albania has a real chance to offer its citizens free movement to EU countries; however, the lack of political dialogue remains a concern. 
Albania must also do more to fight crime and corruption to benefit from the visa liberalisation process, Fajon said, during a conference organised by the integration ministry in Tirana.

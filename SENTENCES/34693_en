MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Association of Returnees to Mostar sent an open letter to local institutions and the resident delegation of the European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (19 August), seeking the reallocation of EU assistance funds.
The organisation opposes the recent EC decision to exclude the region of Herzegovina from the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation programme.
The fund is expected to inject several millions euros into refugee return projects.
The letter said that about 9,000 returnee households in the region would not have access to the fund as a result of recent changes to the programme.

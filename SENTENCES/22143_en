TIRANA, Albania -- The United States granted 11.7m euros in aid to Albania on Friday (October 17th) to help it tackle corruption and strengthen its judiciary system. 
The accord aims at reducing corruption and inefficiency in tax administration, establishing a one-stop agency for business licencing and creating a transparent construction permit system, a statement by the US Embassy in Tirana said. 
The two-year program, managed by USAID, will also finance the creation of units in six Albanian cities to investigate corruption.

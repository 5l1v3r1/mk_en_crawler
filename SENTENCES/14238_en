THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A spokeswoman for prosecutors at the UN tribunal told reporters on Thursday (12 January) that Serbia could arrest Ratko Mladic within 38 hours if its government had the political will to do so.
The Serbian authorities, she added, were doing nothing to bring to justice five fugitives, including former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic.
Serbian officials have said that the latest deadline for the arrest of Mladic is 31 March, when the US State Department must certify to Congress that Serbia is co-operating with the UN and merits aid.
In Friday's edition of the Belgrade daily Blic, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement might be suspended due to the lack of co-operation with the UN tribunal.
The government has decided to establish a national security council to better co-ordinate war crimes co-operation.

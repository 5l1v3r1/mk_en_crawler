SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) - High Representative Paddy Ashdown on Friday (16 April) fired General Cvjetko Savic, the chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb Army, for obstructing the investigation into the Srebrenica massacre.
Dejan Miletic, the Bosnian Serb government's liaison officer with the UN war crimes tribunal, was also dismissed.
Ashdown warned that other officials, including Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic, President Dragan Cavic, Interior Minister Zoran Djeric and Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic would also be sacked if co-operation with the special commission set up to investigate the Srebrenica atrocities does not improve.
In other news, the Bosnian Serb police raided the homes of current and former intelligence officers Friday in search of information about the whereabouts of fugitive war criminals.
Meanwhile, police in Sarajevo reported that they have arrested a former Bosnian Serb soldier on war crimes charges.
The UN tribunal has authorised the prosecution of Boro Krsmanovic in his home country.

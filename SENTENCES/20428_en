STRASBOURG, France -- At a ceremony Monday (November 12th), Serbia passed its presidency of the Council of Europe (CoE) Committee of Ministers to Slovakia.
Commenting on the results of Serbia's six-month presidency, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said that Serbia focused on four main goals -- promoting values advocated by the CoE, improving individual security, building tolerance, and strengthening co-operation between the CoE and countries of the Western Balkans.
A major achievement, he said, was that a large number of NGOs and other public organisations from the region became involved in CoE projects during Serbia's presidency.
In other news Monday, CoE observers arrived in Kosovo, ahead of Saturday's parliamentary elections.
In all, the CoE is sending about 180 monitors.

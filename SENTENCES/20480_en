SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU Enlargement Commission Olli Rehn reiterated on Friday (October 12th) that there will be no Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH if there is no police reform agreement. 
He also scolded political leaders for failing to work for compromise. 
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak goes before the EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday to acknowledge that no SAA will be signed this year after all.
Republika Sprska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik downplayed the ramifications. 
He said it is not the duty of the high representative to decide on police restructuring, and he dismissed warnings of isolation for BiH as the only Balkan country without any formal relations with the EU.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A regional summit on energy, investments and economic development began on Thursday (July 9th) in the coastal resort of Dubrovnik. 
Heads of government, foreign ministers and diplomats from the region, as well as officials from the United States and the EU, are participating in the two-day forum. 
The Croatian government will do its best to fulfil the criteria to join the EU, new Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said at the opening ceremony, adding Zagreb expects Europe to abolish artificial obstacles along the way. 
Summit discussions focus on further EU and NATO enlargement involving Western Balkan countries, co-operation in the energy sector and new economic projects.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic refused to take part, accusing Croatian authorities of breaking a scheduling agreement. 
He was supposed to speak during the first day of the summit, but ended up scheduled for the second day, together with members of the Kosovo delegation.

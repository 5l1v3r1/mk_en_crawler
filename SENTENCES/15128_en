ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey may be banned from hosting a Formula One race in 2007 and beyond, following an investigation by the world motor sports governing body FIA, into the awards ceremony last Sunday (27 August). 
Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, who awarded the prize to winner Felipe Massa, was introduced as "president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus". 
The TRNC is recognised solely by Ankara. 
FIA "is concerned that its political neutrality may have been compromised", a spokesman said.

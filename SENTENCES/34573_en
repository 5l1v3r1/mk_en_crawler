ATHENS, Greece -- The government said Wednesday (1 October) that a series of arson attacks the previous day were the work of vandals rather than extremists. 
The authorities reported that cooking gas canisters were used to set fire to two political party offices and the homes of a conservative politician and a professor. 
An anarchist group calling itself Post-Midnight Slalom claimed responsibility for the attacks and threatened to burn offices as long as businesses were burning forests.

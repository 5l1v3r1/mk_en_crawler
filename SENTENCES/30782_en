BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities launched an investigation Monday (January 10th) to determine who painted nationalist messages on the walls of the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest late Sunday.
The foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the incident, describing it as an isolated act of vandalism.
Hungary's Ambassador to Bucharest, Oszkar Fuzes, echoed the view, saying the messages do not reflect relations between the two countries.
Authorities did not say what the messages were, and most of the paint was cleaned off early Monday.
In other news Monday, prosecutors said they have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian European Parliament member accused of insulting and throwing a glass of water at an official who was trying to deliver an eviction order.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor, leader of the nationalist Greater Romania party, allegedly also threatened police officers.
The party was being asked to vacate a building that is being returned to its pre-communist era owners.

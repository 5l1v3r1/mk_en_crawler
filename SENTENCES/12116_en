BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who is also chairman of the federal council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, says state aid to war crimes indictees and their families amounted to around 200,000 euros in 2004. 
In an interview Saturday (12 March), Ljajic added that the state is currently assisting the families of 27 indictees, including former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic.
Also on Saturday, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said that during his visit to The Hague last week, tribunal representatives spoke for the first time about the "credibility" of the Serbian government. 
He credited the recent flurry of voluntary surrenders.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro's political leaders meet Monday for a special session devoted to Kosovo. 
The goal is to co-ordinate differing stances ahead of the anticipated start of talks on Kosovo's status. 
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic predicts those talks could open in July.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU's police and judicial mission EULEX will deploy soon in northern Kosovo and be active across the country by year's end, EULEX Deputy Chief Roy Reeve announced on Tuesday (September 23rd).
He added the mission has established good co-operation with its predecessor, UNMIK, and will work with the police, judiciary and customs sectors.
In other news, ten observers from Kosovo's Central Elections Commission will monitor the October 5th local elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The Sarajevo-based elections commission sent an invitation to Pristina in May.
Authorities in Republika Srpska oppose the move, as BiH has not recognised Kosovo.
Also Tuesday, Returns and Communities Minister Boban Stankovic resigned from the Kosovo government, citing personal reasons.
He was one of two Serb ministers in the cabinet.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci appointed another Serb, Sasa Rasic, to replace him.

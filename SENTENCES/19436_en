BUCHAREST, Romania -- Preliminary data released on Monday (November 26th) suggests only 26.37% of registered voters participated in Sunday's referendum on a majority voting system, well under the 50% turnout required for the vote to be considered valid. 
Under these circumstances, the electoral bureau declared the results invalid. 
Of those who voted, 81.4% supported the majority voting system and 16.12% opposed it.
In other news, President Traian Basescu arrived on Monday for a three-day official visit to Spain. 
Immigration will be among the main issues discussed, especially the restrictions Madrid has imposed on Romanian workers.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) government adopted three bills Thursday (17 April) -- a draft law on criminal procedure, a draft criminal code and a draft law on protection of witnesses.
Afterwards, FBiH Minister of Justice Borjana Kristo said the drafts were part of a comprehensive judicial reform in BiH, aimed at harmonising federal and state-level legislation.
She added that new provisions would step up sanctions for criminal acts related to the violation of rights and freedoms.
Obstructing returns could lead to prison sentences of up to ten years.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A hand grenade exploded outside a bakery in Zvecan late on Saturday (September 18th), damaging a shop owned by an Albanian. 
No injuries were reported. 
Kosovo Police spokesperson Besim Hoti assumes it was ethnically motivated, as two weeks ago, an explosive device was tossed in front of the same bakery in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government went before parliament on Wednesday (19 March) and took responsibility for a controversial anti-corruption legislative package.
The move effectively enforces the bill without a vote by parliament.
The government introduced several amendments to the initial package, in a bid to increase transparency and ban participation of lawmakers in managing boards of state and private companies.
The opposition, however, describes the measure as an attempt to institutionalise corruption and is threatening a no-confidence vote.

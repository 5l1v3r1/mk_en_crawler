SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Friday (26 May) ratified the bilateral agreement with the United States, which allows US forces to use Bulgarian military bases. 
The defence co-operation agreement was sealed during US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to Sofia last month.
In other news, Bulgarian police arrested two men on Saturday, charging them with publishing download links to 20 million songs and hundreds of films on their Web site. 
Users could download as many of the songs and films as they liked for a monthly fee of 2 euros. 
Experts believe that the pair caused at least 25m euros worth of damage to the film and recording industries.

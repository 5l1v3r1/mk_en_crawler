BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) plans to discuss the EU visa liberalisation regime for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania on Wednesday (October 6th), with a vote expected on Thursday.
Speaking to Bosnian journalists in Brussels on Tuesday, BiH Ambassador to the EU Osman Topcagic voiced optimism that the EP will support scrapping the two countries' EU travel visa regimes.
The final decision on scrapping visa requirements is up to the EU justice ministers, who are expected to meet in November.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The EU wants Serbia's passport-issuing system to act as a barrier to keep crime from spreading into member countries, as a guarantee for visa liberalisation, the Belgrade-based daily Blic reported on Thursday (May 14th).
The newspaper cites sources within the Serbian government who say the EU has some concerns regarding the way Serbia issues its ID documents and has suggested the system become more rigourous.
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic is expected to respond to the EU's request, offering guarantees against the spread of crime and corruption, the newspaper said.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader announced on Thursday (3 August) that salaries in the public administration might rise by 5 per cent as of 2007. 
His comment came during a meeting with representatives of the trade unions and the Croatian Association of Employers. 
Sanader cautioned that real wages must not increase faster than GDP growth, if Croatia wants to be competitive. 
At the same time, he added that the cabinet would discuss the possibility of introducing a minimum wage in the private sector.
Also Thursday, President Stipe Mesic called for the expansion and upgrade of prison facilities in the country. 
During a visit to the Lepoglava detention centre, he talked to prisoners and staff, who complained about inadequate resources.

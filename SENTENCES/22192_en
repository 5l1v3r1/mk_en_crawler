NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat said on Monday (September 15th) that current circumstances in Cyprus are conducive to reuniting the divided island. 
"However, these good conditions do not guarantee a settlement that can be accepted by both communities," Talat told representatives of Turkish Cypriot NGOs, adding any reunification text would face a referendum.
Separately Monday, Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou said progress depends mainly on Turkey. 
"Now it is of major importance whether Turkey will leave the way open for Talat to negotiate keeping in mind Turkish Cypriots' interests rather than Turkey's strategic interests," the minister told the Greek daily Kathimerini.
In other news, Greek Cypriot presidential adviser George Iacovou and Turkish Cypriot adviser Ozdil Nami met on Monday. 
They were laying the groundwork for the next round of direct reunification talks between Talat and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias on Thursday.

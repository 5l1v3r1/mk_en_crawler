PORTO CARRAS, Greece -- Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, announced on Saturday (21 June) that the governments of Serbia-Montenegro and Kosovo have agreed to start direct talks before the end of July.
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic reiterated his country's willingness to seek solutions to the problems with Kosovo and indicated that the United States, the EU and the UN will participate in the negotiations.
UNMIK chief Michael Steiner appeared to rule out any discussion of the future status of the province.
Also Saturday, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic visited centres for Kosovo refugees in Montenegro.
Speaking in his capacity as head of the Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo, he said the federation was doing its best to help the return of refugees, but could not guarantee the process would be completed in the near term.

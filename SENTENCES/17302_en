ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish Parliament failed to elect a president on Friday (April 27th) making a second round of voting necessary.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), received 357 votes, ten short of the two-thirds majority needed.
If the second round on Wednesday also fails, a third round will take place on May 9th.
Only a simple majority will be needed in that vote.
The opposition, which objects to Gul's candidacy, boycotted the initial round and has filed a challenge before the country's Constitutional Court.
If the judges decide that the vote was unconstitutional, the government will have to hold an early general election within 90 days.
Further controversy erupted later on Friday, when the Turkish military issued a statement warning that it could take action against the AKP-led government."The Turkish Armed Forces maintain their sound determination to carry out their duties stemming from laws to protect the unchangeable characteristics of the Republic of Turkey.
Their loyalty to this determination is absolute," the country's top generals said.
The military has deposed three Turkish governments since 1960.
Cemil Cicek, justice minister and government spokesman, accused the generals of trying to influence the decision of the Constitutional Court.
He said it was unthinkable that the General Staff should speak out against a government whose orders it has a duty to obey.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan held an emergency meeting with some of his cabinet ministers on Saturday.
The government has made it clear that it will not withdraw Gul's candidacy.

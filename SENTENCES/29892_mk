BELGRADE, Serbia -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik firmly rejects the possibility of the entity seceding from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Politika on Sunday (May 22nd), he said that Bosnian Serb leaders will not engage in "adventures such as secession from BiH". 
Dodik however stressed that RS would like to see the balance -- established by the Dayton Peace Agreement -- in which all three constituent peoples have equal rights. 
He reiterated that a proposed referendum on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office is no longer necessary after an agreement reached with the EU that a structured dialogue on the Bosnian judiciary will be launched. 
The dialogue will start next month in Banja Luka, he added.

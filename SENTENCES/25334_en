SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU and US representatives met with leaders of the main parties in BiH on Tuesday (November 24th), and submitted a new constitutional reforms package aimed at accelerating the country's EU and NATO integration. 
None of the participants in the talks made any public comment on the reforms, but media reports suggest they involve modifications to the proposal discussed last month at Camp Butmir, near Sarajevo.

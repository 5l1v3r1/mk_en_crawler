VIENNA, Austria -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte demanded again Sunday (29 December) that Belgrade authorities immediately arrest former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic.
Del Ponte, who has long maintained that she has proof the war crimes indictee is in Serbia, accused Belgrade authorities of doing nothing to bring him to justice.
She said she also knows the whereabouts of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
In an open letter Sunday, Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic called on del Ponte to resign, accusing her of bias against Serbs.
He said that she has only indicted Serbs despite "abundant proof" that ethnic Albanians also committed atrocities during the Kosovo war.
Del Ponte's spokeswoman, Florence Hartmann, dismissed the accusation, saying ethnicity was not a factor in issuing indictments (AP, B92, Tanjug, FoNet, Blic, BBC - 29/12/02)

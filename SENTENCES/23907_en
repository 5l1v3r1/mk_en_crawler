BUCHAREST, Romania -- Education-related trade unions threatened to start protests Tuesday (January 20th) unless the government allocates 6% of the GDP to the education sector so that teachers can receive a promised 50% pay hike. 
The announcement came after representatives of the main trade unions met with Education Minister Ecaterina Andronescu and Labour Minister Marian Sarbu. 
Gheorghe Isvorau, president of the Spiru Haret Federation, said the government has committed to grant the increase, which is to be part of the 2009 state budget.
Separately Tuesday, three federations of Romanian transport companies said they will organise a rally Thursday to protest the high number of taxi authorisations granted and the resumption of public transport between Bucharest and Ilfov County, which puts private minibuses out of business. 
The unions threaten to picket the government headquarters, Bucharest City Hall and the transport ministry.

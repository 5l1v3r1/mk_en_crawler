BELGRADE, Serbia -- League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina (LSV) leader Nenad Canak and his deputy, Bojan Kostres, have received death threats, the party announced on Monday (September 21st).
A threatening letter said the two have one month to withdraw from politics or be killed.
The LSV, a member of the ruling coalition, has informed the police.
This is not the first time the pair have received threats.
Kostres said on Monday that he believes the threats came from people unhappy with party activities against far-right organisations.
The LSV proposed a law, which parliament passed in late May, banning neo-Nazi and fascist organisations from gathering at events and using Nazi symbols.
The law also prohibits the fuelling of national, religious and racial intolerance.
Separately Monday, the Justice Ministry announced an initiative to ban the activities of all organisations that call for violence.
Dozens of ultranationalists have been arrested in Belgrade over the past week for disturbing public order.
Several foreigners have been attacked, while the Gay Pride Parade, which was planned for Sunday, was cancelled due to threats by extremists.

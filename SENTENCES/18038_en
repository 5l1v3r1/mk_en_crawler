BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Brussels is still weighing Bulgaria's request for expert EU assistance and monitoring in its ongoing corruption probe. 
EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini met with Bulgarian Interior Minister Rumen Petkov and Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev late on Monday (May 14th) in the Belgian capital. 
Frattini however implied that the case, implicating senior government officials and investigators, would be a test of the country's judicial independence and abilities. 
The corruption scandal has already resulted in the dismissal of two deputy ministers and the suspension of Deputy Prime Minister Rumen Ovcharov.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ivica Kostelic, Croatia's top male skier and leader in the World Cup slalom standings, denied Thursday (16 January) that he had any sympathy for Nazism.
He apologised to those who might have been offended by remarks he made in an interview with a local newspaper and said his words were taken out of context to discredit him.
In the interview, Kostelic said he was "ready as a German soldier on June 22, 1941" for the race in Kranjska Gora.
He also compared communism to Nazism, saying the latter was better because it offered "the possibility for an individual to advance".
Kostelic said he had made these remarks informally after the interview and may have been influenced by a war movie he had watched the night before.

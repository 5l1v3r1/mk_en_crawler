BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) supports the actions undertaken by the government of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and its anti-corruption measures, OLAF Director-General Franz-Hermann Bruner said on Wednesday (September 9th), after meeting with Borisov in Brussels.
He is making his first official visit there as prime minister.
Accompanying him on the trip are Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov, Justice Minister Margarita Popova, Foreign Minister Rumyana Zheleva, and Agriculture and Food Industry Minister Miroslav Naydenov.
Ahead of the visit, the government presented a new package of measures to reform the judiciary and fight corruption.
The measures include banning cash deals for large sums, especially in property sales, as well as more transparent work by public administrators, and numerous audits to eradicate corruption and tax evasion.
After the meeting, Bruner urged Bulgaria to continue along this path.
Fighting corruption is key to unblocking EU financing, he added.

Statistics compiled by the World Health Organisation and released by the Croatian National Institute of Public Health suggest some positive health trends among Croatians.
The birth rate rose a little in 2009, and there were fewer suicides, homicides and fatal car accidents.
But there was also an eye-opener:
for first time ever, the death rate among women was up, by a slight 0.8%.
The Health of the Nation report by Dr Tanja Coric finds that 26, 395 women died in 2009, compared to 26,019 men.
Women still have a longer life expectancy in Croatia:
79.6 years, compared to an average of 73.4 years for men.
"At the age of 68, I don't feel like a young woman, but I feel just fine.
Of course, hot summer days can be exhausting but this is why I swim regularly or stay at home during top temperature days and try to eat healthy.
I admit I do not exercise, but I walk a lot," says Split-based professor Zejra Lusic.
She travels to foreign countries at least twice a year and keeps up with fellow travellers even years younger.
Croatia's higher death rate among women does not worry her.
Overall, slightly fewer deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases in 2009, while the rate of cancer-related illnesses was higher.
A full 75% of all deaths were heart disease or cancer-related.
The report also tracked suicides and violence-related deaths.
There were 2,986 of them last year:
790 suicides, 58 homicides, 2,121 fatal accidents, four killed by landmines and 13 unresolved deaths.
Both the suicide and homicide rates were down, as were the number of traffic fatalities:
616 people died in car crashes in 2009, 89 fewer than in 2008.
On the other end of the spectrum is the birth rate.
Croatia's is low -- statistically there are only 11.8 newborns per 1,000 people, but last year the country posted its highest number of births in five years:
44,754 babies were born -- 51.3% were boys and 48.7% were girls.

TIRANA, Albania -- Tensions are high ahead of the May 8th local elections, as a member of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) was arrested on Wednesday (March 23rd) in Tirana after a fight with employees in a local administration office. 
SP official Krenar Cenollari and fellow party lawmaker Sajmir Tahiri, visited the number six office in Tirana to ask for the voters' list of the area, which employees refused to supply. 
Cenollari and Tahiri responded by barring door from the outside, leaving the employees locked inside. 
Cenollari was soon taken to a police station where he was kept for eight hours, while a group of about 200 supporters protested outside.
The conflict arouse after the SP voiced suspicions that people from outside Tirana are being added to the lists by force, in a move supported by the government. 
SP leader Edi Rama warned of electoral fraud, insisting voters' lists are being heavily manipulated.
Separately, the opposition has registered its Alliance for the Future coalition at the Central Election Commission. 
The coalition consists of the SP and five smaller opposition parties.

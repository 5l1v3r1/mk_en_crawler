TIRANA, Albania -- Three weeks of NATO military exercises under way in Albania will prove that the army is technically prepared to join the Alliance, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Luan Hoxha said on Thursday (October 18th). 
More than 1,100 soldiers from 25 countries are participating in the two exercises, which are gauging the co-operation and compatibility of troops from NATO and Partnership for Peace countries.
Also Thursday, the European Commission announced that it will provide Albania with roughly 200m euros to help the country reform its economy and judiciary sectors. 
The programme will be implemented through 2009.

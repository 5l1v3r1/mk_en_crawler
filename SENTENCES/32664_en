ATHENS, Greece -- Mountaineer Nikos Mangitsis, 33, set out on a journey to the Antarctic on Monday (23 December), in an attempt to place the Olympic flag on the South Pole. 
This will be his second such bid - he has already planted the flag on Mt Elbrus in the Caucasus. 
This new effort will be more complicated, however, as Mangitsis will attempt to climb the highest peak in the Antarctic, Mt Vinson (4,897 metres), as well as the highest peak in the two Americas - Aconcagua (6,960 metres) in the Andes. 
The 60-day mission is under the aegis of the Athens Olympic Organising Committee.

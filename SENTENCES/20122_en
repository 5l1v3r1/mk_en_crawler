ANKARA, Turkey -- Outgoing President Ahmet Necdet Sezer declined to approve Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's new cabinet on Thursday (August 16th) leaving the job to his successor, who is likely to be elected by the end of the month. 
Erdogan, who has often clashed with Sezer in the past, said he was surprised that the president had returned the list of ministers without even looking at it. 
He called the decision an act of courtesy to the next president and "a positive approach".
In other news, a charter flight to Turkey was canceled shortly before taking off from the Romanian city of Timisuara when the plane's cabin filled with smoke. 
Passengers were evacuated using emergency procedures and slides. 
One of the 158 people on board was injured slightly.

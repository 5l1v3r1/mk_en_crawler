BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated Saturday (March 10th) the Union's support for UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's proposal to resolve the Kosovo status issue and for submitting the draft to the UN Security Council by the end of this month. 
Rehn's statement came after Ahtisaari announced the end of fruitless negotiations, held between the Belgrade and Pristina teams in Vienna earlier in the day. 
Rehn stressed that the UN roadmap represented "a realistic compromise", providing the framework for "a future stable, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo". 
Cristina Gallach, spokesperson for EU security chief Javier Solana, echoed that sentiment on Sunday.
In Washington, US State Department spokesperson Joanne Moore stressed on Sunday that Washington views Ahtisaari's amended draft proposal as a "fair" one, and urged all parties to come together on it. 
But Sergei Baburin, vice-chairman of the Russian Parliament, voiced doubts that the UN Security Council would adopt the new resolution, triggering concerns that Russia and China could use their veto power.

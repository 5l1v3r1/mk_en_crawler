BELGRADE, Serbia -- Arresting war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic is the government's number one priority, said Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
"Realistically, that's the biggest problem for this government. 
Now, all of Serbia is Ratko Mladic's hostage," he told the daily Vecernje Novosti on Wednesday (October 29th). 
He stressed that if Serbia does not extradite Mladic to The Hague soon, its failure would effectively block its EU integration process, which would cause political problems.
In other news, Serbia's newest political party, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), denies it has been negotiating to form a coalition with President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party. 
The SNS, led by former Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic, issued a statement Wednesday reiterating it is an opposition party that will remain a fierce critic of Tadic's rule.

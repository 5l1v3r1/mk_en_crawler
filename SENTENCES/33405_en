PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO will reduce its mission in Kosovo from 27,000 people to 17,000 by the end of the year, local media sources reported Saturday (3 May).
NATO spokesman Yves Brodeur said NATO's Council of Ministers would base its decision on an assessment of security levels in the province, submitted by KFOR.
In other news, UNMIK chief Michael Steiner said in an interview Friday that the province could not achieve full independence in the short term.
Commenting on Kosovo's status, he said the process of reforms eventually would lead to a broad autonomy.

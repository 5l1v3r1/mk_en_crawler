MOSCOW, Russia -- The possible deployment of elements of the US-missile defence shield has not been discussed by parliament or by the government in Sofia, Bulgarian parliamentary speaker Tsetska Tsacheva said on Tuesday (March 16th) at a meeting in Moscow with State Duma speaker Boris Gryzlov. 
She added that the possible deployment of such elements is only an idea of NATO that has been shared with the media by US officials. 
"The State Duma will not ratify a future nuclear disarmament treaty with the US unless it includes links to missile defence issues," Gryzlov warned.

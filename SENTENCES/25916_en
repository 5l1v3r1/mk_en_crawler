SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board held individual consultations Wednesday (November 18th) with political leaders, stressing the need for talks on constitutional changes. 
Such reforms, PIC says, would make state institutions more functional and better enable the country to meet criteria for EU and NATO integration. 
The Board is also expected to discuss the political crisis in Mostar, where city council members have been unable to elect a mayor, despite repeated attempts. 
Also under discussion are the country's 2010 budget and media freedom.
In other news Wednesday, the UN Security Council extended the mandate of the EU's stabilisation force in BiH, EUFOR, by one year. 
The Security Council stressed that the "comprehensive and co-ordinated return of refugees and displaced persons throughout the region continues to be crucial to lasting peace".

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The border demarcation between Macedonia and Kosovo should be completed before Kosovo's final status is determined, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker agreed on Tuesday (October 3rd) in Skopje.
Gruevski also told Ruecker that, given the sensitive period ahead for Kosovo, strict monitoring of the shared border must be conducted to prevent criminal or radical groups from provoking new tensions.
In other news, the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) announced it would hold a confidence vote Saturday regarding leader Vlado Buckovski.
At issue is SDSM's poor showing in the recent parliamentary elections.
Separately, SDSM and the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, among others, were cited on Tuesday for campaign financing irregularities.
Evidence of over-spending will be sent to parliament, the cabinet and state auditors.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE Ambassador to Belgrade, Maurizio Massari, welcomed on Thursday (14 October) the Serbian Parliament's new resolution in support of Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Massari called it an important step forward for Serbia, noting that the legislature gave the government a formal mandate to prepare a national strategy for EU integration, with clear commitments and tasks.
Also Thursday, the dispute between Serbian President Boris Tadic and the government regarding Kosovo-related issues continued. 
The government rejected Tadic's claim that state officials or institutions were involved in organising a Wednesday rally in Belgrade against Serb participation in next week's Kosovo elections. 
The pro-Milosevic Socialist Party of Serbia and Serbian Radical Party also repeated calls for Tadic's impeachment.

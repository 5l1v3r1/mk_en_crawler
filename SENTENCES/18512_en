SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Influential businessman Manol Velev, the husband of Bulgarian State Agency for Youth and Sports chief Vessela Lecheva, was seriously wounded Wednesday morning (July 11th) in what appears to be a mob hit.
Velev, 49, was gunned down outside his office in Sofia, and took a bullet to the head.
He has been tied to notorious Bulgarian crime boss Vassil Bozhkov.
Bulgaria has been criticised repeatedly by the EU for failing to stop gang shootings.

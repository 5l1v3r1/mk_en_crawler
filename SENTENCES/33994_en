SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Leaders of the Macedonian opposition party VMRO-DPMNE urged Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski to resign Saturday (1 November).
The party's executive committee cited what it called poor economic results, a worsened security situation, public procurement scandals, and rule of law issues.
For his part, Crvenkovski offered a review of the government's past performance Saturday, saying stability and prospects had improved in all areas of life.
In other news, authorities launched the voluntary weapons collection programme on Saturday.
Two villages, Aracinovo and Lipkovo, are boycotting participation, over what local officials describe as the slow implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.

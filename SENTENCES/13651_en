STRASBOURG, France -- The Council of Europe's Venice Commission is urging political parties in Montenegro to reach a consensus on the rules for the planned independence referendum next year. 
Given the significance of the vote, all parties in Montenegro must launch talks and agree on turnout requirements and the margin of victory needed for a result to be considered valid, the Commission said Tuesday (20 December).
In a statement, the commission said Montenegro's legislation regulating the conduct of the referendum is generally compliant with international standards. 
It also opposed allowing Montenegrin citizens living in Serbia to vote in the poll, saying this would be a breach of standards.
Meanwhile, EU security chief Javier Solana's special envoy for Montenegro, Miroslav Lajcak, began meeting Tuesday with officials in Podgorica. 
He also urged all parties to join the dialogue regarding the referendum.

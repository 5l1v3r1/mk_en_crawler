BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic said Tuesday (27 May) that a law on prosecuting war crimes indictees would likely be adopted in June. 
He said the draft law would be considered by the Serbian government Thursday, before being sent to parliament for approval. 
The law became necessary after the UN tribunal in The Hague indicated it is willing to allow local authorities to prosecute some low-profile war criminals.

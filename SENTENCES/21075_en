BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ultranationalist Radical Party (SRS) said on Sunday (September 2nd) that it would demand that the trial against SRS leader Vojislav Seselj at The Hague be broadcast live on national television. 
He is charged with involvement in a plot to murder, torture and imprison non-Serbs during the 1990s conflicts. 
The trial is expected to begin on November 6th, but Seselj wants it postponed until sometime in March. 
The SRS is vowing to launch a petition and collect 1 million signatures on behalf of the live broadcast.

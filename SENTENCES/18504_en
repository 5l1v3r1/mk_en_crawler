LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari reiterated that there is no alternative to the supervised independence of Kosovo, in an interview with the Slovene daily Delo published late last week. 
Ahtisaari says Kosovo cannot remain part of Serbia because the Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90% of the population, do not want to stay within Serbia. 
He added that one day Serbia would change its stance, if it wants to join the EU. 
Reluctant to say whether the UN Security Council would adopt a new resolution on Kosovo, he suggested it might happen in June, when the United States presides over the Council.
In Washington this week, the Senate is expected to discuss a draft resolution backing Kosovo's independence. 
The document, submitted by four influential senators, Joe Biden, Joe Lieberman, John McCain and Gordon Smith, expresses support for Ahtisaari's proposal as the only possible solution to the current situation. 
Belgrade authorities reportedly plan to lobby against the resolution.

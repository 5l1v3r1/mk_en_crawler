SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview with the daily Dnevni Avaz on Saturday (31 July), High Representative Paddy Ashdown said he will remain in BiH until November 2005. 
He explained that this means a six-month extension of his initial mandate, which was due to expire in May 2005. 
Ashdown said the international community would in no way leave BiH after his term expires, but added that the form of its presence likely would be altered, depending on BiH's progress in the Euro-Atlantic integration process.

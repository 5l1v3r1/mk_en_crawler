ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and Zoran Milanovic, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), once again failed Monday (May 10th) to agree on how expatriates should be allowed to vote. 
The issue is the main stumbling block between the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the SDP, with regards to planned constitutional amendments. 
The SDP believes that Croats living in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) should only be able to vote at consular missions, while the HDZ thinks more venues should be permitted. 
President Ivo Josipovic proposes a third option: restrict voting in BiH to 20 or 30 sites. 
Constitutional changes need a two-thirds parliamentary majority, which essentially requires support from the SDP.

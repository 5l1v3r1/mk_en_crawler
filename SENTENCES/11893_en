BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Thursday (16 June) denied his government is in contact with Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, following a spate of domestic and international media reports suggesting that negotiations are under way on his surrender. 
Such erroneous reports only hamper efforts to apprehend Mladic, the prime minister said. 
Kostunica was speaking at a joint briefing with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who praised Serbia for its improved co-operation with the tribunal and said he hoped the EU would be able to start negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia-Montenegro as early as October. 
Kostunica also met with EU security chief Javier Solana, who urged Serbia to continue with reforms necessary to meet EU standards.
While in Brussels, Kostunica set off a controversy by handing EU officials a list of Montenegrin citizens residing in Serbia and insisting they would have the right to vote in any referendum on Montenegro's independence. 
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic criticised the move, saying it represented direct interference in Montenegro's internal affairs.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs Miodrag Pandurevic said on Wednesday (20 July) that a special commission is looking at all cases in which BiH citizenship was issued to foreigners after the end of the war in 1996.
He added that a total of 11,000 naturalised Bosnians of foreign origin were registered in the country thus far.
Pandurevic also said that the ministry prepared legal amendments under which the commission would be authorised to abolish all decisions in which irregularities and violations are established.
In an article Thursday, the Sarajevo newspaper Dnevni avaz cited government sources who say some 750 individuals have been checked and that "suspicious" facts emerged in 400 of the cases.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbia-Montenegro is expected to challenge accusations by BiH that it engaged in genocide during the 1992-1995 conflict.
The International Court of Justice began hearing the case Monday (27 February).
Serbia will argue that when the lawsuit was filed, its predecessor, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was neither a member of the UN, nor a signatory to the international convention on genocide.
This is considered a landmark case, the first in which an entire country is being prosecuted for genocide.
In other news Monday, Serbia's Parliament plans an extraordinary session to discuss a report on the Kosovo status negotiations, submitted by the government.
The report describes the results of last week's first round of talks between negotiators from Belgrade and Pristina.

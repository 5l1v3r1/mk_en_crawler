ATHENS, Greece -- Two days of protests turned deadly on Wednesday (May 5th), when a Molotov cocktail exploded and burned inside an Athens bank, killing at least three people.
Clashes also broke out between police and protestors as a group of about 50 people tried to storm the parliament building for the second straight day.
Once again, police used tear gas to disperse them.
Wednesday's protest march in the capital attracted about 20,000 people, angry with the government's austerity measures.
A demonstration in Thessaloniki drew about 14,000 people.
Meanwhile, a nationwide strike against the austerity measures entered its second day Wednesday.
Several unions are participating, closing down ministries, transportation -- including air travel -- schools, hospitals, and many private sector companies.
On Monday, around 200 Communist Party supporters staged a blockade of the Acropolis, draping the ancient landmark with a huge sign reading "Peoples of Europe Rise Up".

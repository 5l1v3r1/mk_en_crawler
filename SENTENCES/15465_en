MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK on Monday (25 September) reopened the main bridge in Mitrovica to traffic.
The bridge, which separates the Albanian and Serb quarters of the divided city, was closed for almost a month after an ethnic Albanian youngster lobbed a bomb into a cafe on the northern, Serb-populated side, injuring ten Serbs.
According to UNMIK, police presence in the area has been beefed up.
Local Serbs wanted the bridge to remain closed, fearing more violence.

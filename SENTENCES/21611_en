THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Hague war crimes tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann will appear in court Monday (October 27th) to face contempt charges. 
Prosecutors say Hartmann deliberately disclosed confidential information about the decisions the Court of Appeals made in the trial of late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. 
The information appeared in her book, "Peace and Punishment", published last year. 
The French national served as former tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte's spokeswoman from 1999 to 2006. 
If convicted, Hartman could face up to seven years in prison, a fine of 100,000 euros, or both.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In a media statement Friday (30 September), Democratic Union of Integration (DUI) leader Ali Ahmeti said he plans to introduce discussions within the ruling coalition about expanding the use of Albanian as a second official language. 
Ahmeti said he would again raise a DUI proposal to allow the use of Albanian in the parliament, government and army command. 
President Branko Crvenkovski has rejected the idea, noting that it was intentionally left out of the Ohrid Accords during negotiations in 2001.

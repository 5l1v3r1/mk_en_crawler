SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The appeals chamber of the Court of BiH sentenced a former Bosnian Muslim commander to ten years in prison Thursday (January 20th) for war crimes committed against Croatian Serb soldiers in 1995.
Sefik Alic was found guilty of inhuman treatment of four detainees and failing to prevent their killing.
Alic served in the Fifth Corps of the Muslim-led Bosnian Army.
A first instance court had cleared him of responsibility for the crimes in April 2008.
Alic's lawyer vows to appeal this latest ruling.

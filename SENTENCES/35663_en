ATHENS, Greece -- Workers slid the second of two giant arches into place at the Olympic stadium on Friday (4 June), creating the key landmark of the 2004 Olympics.
The arches will support a vast glass-and-steel roof over the 75,000-seat stadium.
The project was plagued by delays and was almost abandoned because of fears that work would not be completed in time.
Also Friday, organisers began a week of dress rehearsals at the Olympic venues to help pinpoint problems and fix them before the Games begin on 13 August.

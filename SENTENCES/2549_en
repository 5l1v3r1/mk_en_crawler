Albania backs the Contact Group's guidelines for resolving Kosovo's status, Albanian Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli said during her visit to the province last week. 
"There will be no return to the past, no division and no modification of the borders. 
That is why we need to work on the standards, decentralisation, and protection of minorities," Topalli said.
At the same time, she reiterated Albania's support for "the European independence of Kosovo", adding that all her country's institutions and political groupings back this stance.
It was Topalli's first time in Kosovo since becoming parliament speaker. 
She is the first top-level Albanian political figure to visit the province since the status resolution process got under way. 
While in Pristina, she met with leaders of the provisional institutions and political parties, and with UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.
The UN-set standards for Kosovo -- including decentralisation and minority protection -- must be seen as a requirement, she said. 
"Implementation of standards and decentralisation would contribute to establishing a normal state," she said after a meeting with her Kosovo counterpart, Nexhat Daci.
Topalli, a member of Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, also urged greater economic co-operation between Albania and Kosovo, especially in the energy sector. 
"Construction of the Durres-Pristina highway will be important for both Kosovo and Albania and will produce a positive effect on their economic development," she said after a meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi.
Topalli also met with Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova.
Since January, a number of prominent members of the Albanian government and business community have visited Pristina in an effort to promote closer economic and commercial co-operation, as well as to reiterate Albania's support for the status resolution process.

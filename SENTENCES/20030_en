SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development (GERB) is ahead of other parties, weeks before the country's mayoral elections on October 28th. 
According to a telephone poll by Barometar Info, quoted by Bulgarian media on Sunday (September 16th), GERB's candidates appear to be ahead in both Sofia and Plovdiv. 
In Sofia, incumbent Mayor Boyko Borisov -- GERB founder -- holds a convincing lead over candidates from the Bulgarian Socialist Party, Attack and the right-wing parties. 
In Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second-largest city, GERB candidate Slavcho Atanasov is set to win outright.

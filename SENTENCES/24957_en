SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police have identified new people suspected of helping wartime commander Ratko Mladic elude capture, SRNA reported on Friday (February 27th).
None of them are described as part of the inner circle, SRNA reported, quoting an official report on co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
Meanwhile, the head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with the tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, predicted on Saturday that Mladic will be in custody by the end of this year.
He said he bases his optimism on "new facts".

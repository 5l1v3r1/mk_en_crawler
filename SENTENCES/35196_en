ATHENS, Greece -- The government is urging all Balkan countries to strengthen co-operation in fighting organised crime and terrorism. 
After a meeting with Albanian counterpart Igli Toska on Monday (26 April), Greek Public Order Minister Giorgos Voulgarakis said the two countries would establish joint task force groups and beef up patrols along their border. 
"Our joint goal is to create a shield that will protect all Balkan countries from organised crime, not just during the Olympics but afterwards, too," Voulgarakis said.
In other news, bad weather has prompted a slight delay in sliding the roof of the main Olympic stadium in place. 
But the project's co-ordinator told local media that the overall deadline for completing the stadium would not be affected. 
The International Olympic Committee has repeatedly voiced concern over the pace of this project.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat warned on Thursday (November 15th) that time is running out for a solution to the decades-long division of the island. 
"Time is working against a solution on Cyprus," Talat told a ceremony marking the 24th anniversary of the self proclamation of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
He accused the Greek Cypriot side of stalling negotiations, saying Greek Cypriots have no incentive for real peace since becoming an EU member.
Separately, US Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns called for a new UN initiative aimed at resolving the Cyprus issue. 
He was speaking before a congressional committee in Washington on Wednesday.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather wrapped up his mandate with a press conference Tuesday (August 28th), predicting the Alliance would remain in the province for at least two more years.
He also urged the international community to make a final decision on Kosovo's status as soon as possible, noting that KFOR has tightened security in areas where it expects problems.
Kather is being succeeded in the post by France's General Xavier Bout de Marnac.
In other news, Wednesday's scheduled meeting between Kosovo's negotiation team, OSCE mission head Werner Wnendt, and UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker has been postponed.
At Ruecker's suggestion, they will meet to determine the exact date of autumn local and general elections, after the Unity Group meets with troika members in Vienna on Thursday.

TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) invited the public Sunday (December 6th) to participate in events this week marking the 19th anniversary of student protests that brought down the communist regime.
The anniversary of December 8th 1990 will also celebrate international relations achievements Albania has made, Prime Minister Sali Berisha -- head of the DP -- said at meeting of party leaders.
Foreign Minister Ilir Meta, head of the junior coalition partner, the Socialist Movement for Integration, described December 8th as the day "the Berlin Wall fell down in Albania".
The Opposition Socialist Party (SP) criticises preparations for the anniversary, reiterating instead the need for a recount of some votes cast during general elections nearly six months ago.

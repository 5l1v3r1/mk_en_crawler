SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO and the EU will likely sign an agreement next week on the takeover of NATO's Allied Harmony mission by the EU rapid reaction force.
The expected date for the signing is 14 March.
Macedonian Ambassador to NATO Nano Ruzin said Wednesday (5 March) that the agreement would cover the exchange of military documents and classified information between the two organisations.
The ceremony was delayed until next week, due to scheduling conflicts of Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who is also President of the EU.
The EU force will likely assume the mission in April rather than this month, as planned.

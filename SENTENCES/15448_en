TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) welcomed on Sunday (24 September) an indication that the ruling Democratic Party (DP) is willing to make a concession regarding the date of the next local elections.
DP has been insisting on holding the vote between 20 December and 20 January, as envisioned by law, while SP sought a later date, in light of traditionally severe winters.
On Saturday, DP parliamentary caucus' chief Bamir Topi suggested that if the constitution allowed, DP would be willing to hold the local elections in two rounds -- one in the winter and one in the spring.

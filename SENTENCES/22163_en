ROME, Italy -- Police announced on Thursday (May 15th) the arrest of hundreds of illegal immigrants in a week-long action, as part of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's new plan to address the problem.
The police arrested a total of 383 people, mostly Romanians and North Africans.
They face various charges, including illegal entry, prostitution, drug trafficking and robbery.
Also Thursday, authorities in Rome raided a gypsy camp and arrested dozens of Romanians and Bosnians without proper immigration papers.
Italians have been demanding action against illegal immigrants, especially Romanians, in the face of growing crime.
Romanian Interior Minister Cristian David visited Rome on Thursday to discuss immigration issues.

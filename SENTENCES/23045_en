ANKARA, Turkey -- Cabinet members criticised the new national programme for the EU integration process and EU-related reforms, media reported on Monday (September 1st).
During a cabinet session earlier in the day, the draft drew strong opposition from ministers, who argued that some parts of the programme fall outside the government's agenda.
The ministers also insisted there is not enough time to implement EU-friendly reforms and criticised Foreign Minister Ali Babacan for failing to discuss the document with other cabinet members.
The government has decided to hold debates before finalising the programme and submitting it to the EU, government spokesman Cemil Cicek said on Monday.
Officials will finalise the draft after deliberations with NGOs and the opposition, thus delaying its submission to Brussels.

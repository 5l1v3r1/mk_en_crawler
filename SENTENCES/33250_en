SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP) leader Abdurahman Aliti submitted his resignation Sunday (11 May) during a party session in Tetovo.
PDP was a signatory of the Ohrid peace accords in 2001 but has lost much of its influence since then.
In other news, early mayoral elections were held Sunday in the municipalities of Suto Orizari, Kocani, Orizari, Vasilevo and Demir Hisar but drew relatively few voters.
The highest rate was in Suto Orizari, where turnout was estimated at less than 54 per cent.
Results will be announced later this week.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Hari Kostov said Saturday he would resign if negotiations with the ethnic Albanian population of Vejce prove unsuccessful.
About 300 Vejce villagers blocked a road into town, marring a ceremony to commemorate eight Macedonian security force personnel killed by rebels in April 2001.

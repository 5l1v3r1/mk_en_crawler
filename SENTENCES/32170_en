ZAGREB, Croatia -- A government representative went before Croatia's Constitutional Court on Thursday (10 October) to discuss the obligations of the armed forces, as they relate to the UN war crimes tribunal's indictment against Gen Janko Bobetko. 
Goran Granic, deputy prime minister and chairman of the government's Council on Co-operation with the tribunal, said the appearance did not mean that Croatia was trying to contest the tribunal's authority. 
Zagreb has already filed an appeal against the indictment and is awaiting a ruling by The Hague judges.

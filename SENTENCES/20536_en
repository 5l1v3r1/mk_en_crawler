BUCHAREST, Romania -- Agriculture Minister Decebal Traian Remes stepped down on Thursday (October 11th) after the National Anti-Corruption Directorate officially asked the president for permission to launch a criminal investigation against Remes. 
Reportedly, Remes was asked to resign by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu after public television channel TVR broadcast aired several video and audio recordings showing former Agriculture Minister Ioan Avram Muresan meeting Remes on a terrace and handing him an envelope with money. 
The bribe allegedly prompted Remes to help businessman Gheorghe Ciorba win several tenders. 
Muresan says the footage is fake and accused President Traian Basescu of orchestrating the case against him.
Meanwhile, the European Commission says it may withhold 100m euros in farm subsidies to Romania because Bucharest has failed to implement an adequate system for accounting and distributing EU agricultural aid.

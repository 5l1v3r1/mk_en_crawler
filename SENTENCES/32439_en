ANKARA, Turkey -- On Friday (21 March), the government delayed opening its airspace to US warplanes for strikes against Iraq, despite approval by parliament on Thursday.
AP quotes western diplomats as saying US and Turkish officials held talks through the night, but failed to reach agreement on conditions for the overflights.
Parliament approved a motion to allow US aircraft to use the country's airspace by a vote of 332 - 202, with one abstention.
Britain is now seeking the use of airspace as well.
Parliament also agreed to allow Turkey's military to deploy troops in northern Iraq to prevent a large-scale wave of refugees.
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher welcomed the decision but said his government opposes any "unilateral action by Turkey or other party in northern Iraq".

ATHENS, Greece -- Thousands of Muslim immigrants gathered in the squares of Athens on Tuesday (November 16th) for prayers marking the Eid al-Adha festival.
Prayers at seven squares went without incident.
But at the eighth, the Attiki Square, a group of ultra-right activists waved Greek flags and threw raw eggs at the crowd.
Police had to intervene to prevent a fight between a group of Muslims and members of the extremist Chryssi Avghi organisation.
That triggered a brief clash between police and several dozen extremists.
The demonstrators also played loud music near where the Muslims were praying and scattered leaflets depicting Muslims as pigs.
No injuries were reported.

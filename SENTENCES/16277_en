TIRANA, Albania -- Local media reported on Wednesday (13 September) that a scandal involving a local private air carrier, Albatros Airways, now also involves the president and the two main parties, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP).
Flights of Albatros Airways, which is co-owned by President Alfred Moisiu's nephew, were recently suspended at the request of the DP-led government's General Directorate of Civil Aviation.
Earlier this week, the DP accused Moisiu of using his influence to lobby on the airline's behalf.
Moisiu has made no official comment, but the SP on Wednesday described the issue as an attempt to exert pressure on the president.
The DP wants him to sack Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku for alleged links to organised crime.
Moisiu has said he needs time to consider the matter.

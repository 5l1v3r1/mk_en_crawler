BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Defence ministers of the NATO member states decided on Friday (13 June) in Brussels to upgrade the NATO headquarters in Larissa, central Greece. 
Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said the Larissa Air Centre should control the airspace from Italy to Turkey, doubling its previous area of responsibility. 
The centre would have a Greek commander. 
NATO members also decided to reduce the number of Alliance bases by 40 per cent and to shift the NATO Air Force Command to Izmir, under an American commander.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Sunday that the government is working hard towards turning the Aegean Sea into a "sea of peace". 
Gul was responding to statements by Papantoniou suggesting that Greece could block the start of Turkey's EU accession talks if the issue of airspace violations was not resolved.

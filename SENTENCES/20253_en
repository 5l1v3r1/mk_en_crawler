ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday (November 14th) denied recent media reports that the Turkish Army is conducting an operation against terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases in northern Iraq. 
"For the time being, our security forces continue their operations within our borders. 
There has been no cross-border operation of any kind," Erdogan told a press conference shortly before his official visit to the Czech Republic. 
Earlier, Air Force Chief General Aydogan Babaoglu also denied any involvement of Turkish war planes in cross-border operations. 
"No airplane of the Turkish military air force has been involved in an operation across the Turkish border," said Babaoglu, who is visiting Northern Cyprus.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Visiting the southeast Turkish region of Diyarbakir on Tuesday (7 September), EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen urged the government to grant more social and cultural rights to Kurds. 
Verheugen, in Turkey to make a final progress report on the country's EU membership bid, said Turkish authorities must do more for the Kurdish minority.
In other news, the Netherlands said Tuesday it would extradite a Kurdistan Workers Party official, Nuriye Kesbir, who is wanted by Turkey. 
Ankara has pledged that Kesbir would be given a fair trial. 
Kesbir, arrested in Amsterdam in 2001, denies involvement in 25 terror strikes against Turkish armed forces.

TIRANA, Albania -- Tourism cannot develop as long as unresolved property issues put off investors, President Bamir Topi said on Saturday (May 24th) during a visit to the southern town of Himara.
"It is up to the government to improve the legal framework and not momentarily favour individual wishes but work for the future of the country," he said.
He added that tourism and property are two essential economic issues.
Interior Minister Bujar Nishani also discussed property issues during a visit to the southern city of Saranda on Saturday.
Local governments want property transfer procedures shifted from central to local governments.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU signed visa facilitation and re-admission agreements with five Balkan countries Tuesday (September 18th).
The accord reduces visa fees and simplifies the rules for granting visas to certain groups of people -- state officials, students, academics and business travellers -- in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, effective as of January 1st, 2008.
In turn, the Western Balkan countries would be expected to demonstrate strengthened rule of law, stepped up efforts against organised crime and corruption, and increased administrative capacity regarding border control and the security of documents.

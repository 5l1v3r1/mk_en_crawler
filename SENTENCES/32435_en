BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Senior Council of Europe (CoE) official Roman Jakic says Serbia-Montenegro has met all CoE entry conditions and may be admitted in April.
Visiting Belgrade Wednesday (19 March), Jakic said CoE President Peter Schieder has asked the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to step up efforts to admit the country.
Newly elected federal Defence Minister Boris Tadic, meanwhile, says he hopes the country will enter NATO's Partnership for Peace programme by the end of the year.

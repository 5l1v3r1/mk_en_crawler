BELGRADE, Serbia -- French Sports Minister Rama Yade arrived on Wednesday (September 30th) in Belgrade, saying he expects that those responsible for the death of a French soccer fan will be punished. 
Brice Taton, 28, passed away on Tuesday after being beaten by Serbian hooligans on September 17th before a match between Toulouse and Partizan Belgrade in the Serbian capital. 
At a joint press conference with Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, Yade thanked the Serbian people for their solidarity. 
On Wednesday, a crowd turned out to light candles and leave flowers in Taton's memory in the city centre.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders have agreed to launch a process that may lead to the resumption of negotiations on the reunification of Cyprus. 
President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met on Saturday (8 July) in the UN buffer zone on the divided island. 
According to Ibrahim Gambari, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs, they agreed to a set of principles on the future reunification of the island. 
The committees that would hold bicommunal talks could be established by the end of July, Gambari said.
The negotiations process has been stalled since April 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected a reunification plan proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic says the government has blocked a deal for exporting arms to Libya because the company behind it is on a UN black list. 
Dinkic explained on Wednesday (March 11th) that Serbian intelligence services intervened after determining the identity of the company, which he did not name. 
The Blic newspaper identifies it as the Seychelles-based company Melvale, owned by Serbian businessman Slobodan Tesic. 
According to Blic, the deal was worth 39m euros.

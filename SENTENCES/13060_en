BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's defence minister acknowledged on Wednesday (28 December) that the army has failed to obey orders to hunt down Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic. 
Zoran Stankovic said he accepts criticism from UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who said recently that the military was the main obstacle in the search for the fugitive. 
A new panel, the National Security Council, will be established to integrate all Hague-related activities.
Also on Wednesday, Belgrade-based B92 Radio reported that the Serbia-Montenegro Army continued to pay a pension to Mladic until last month, when the account was finally frozen. 
The funds were not withdrawn by Mladic himself, but by family members and two military officers, the station said.
Separately Wednesday, Serbia-Montenegro's Supreme Defence Council called on the army to obey orders and join the hunt for fugitive indictees and those who support them.

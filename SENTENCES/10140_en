ATHENS, Greece -- Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis on Wednesday (29 September) unveiled a draft budget for next year aimed at cutting the country's deficit to 2.8 per cent from the current 5.3 percent. 
His announcement came hours after the European Commission said it might cut off nearly $600m in aid to Athens if it does not put its budget in line with the EU's 3 per cent ceiling.
In other news Wednesday, ruling party New Democracy suggested a parliamentary inquiry commission be established to investigate allegations of military supply irregularities by the former PASOK government. 
At issue are questions related to some weapons procurements.

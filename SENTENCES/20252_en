SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak announced that he would restore the unit created to fight corruption and organised crime in BiH, adding that its first task would be to examine possible links between politicians and criminal groups.
In an interview with Slovak media Wednesday (November 14th), he added that the EU apparently cares more about BiH's European integration than the BiH does itself, noting such a situation is ridiculous.
"It takes two to tango, and Bosnian politicians have not managed to do their share of work," the Slovak diplomat said.

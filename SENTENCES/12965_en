SKOPJE, Macedonia -- During a session of parliament's commission for European issues Monday (31 January), Interior Minister Ljubomir Mihajlovski called for the full depoliticisation of the police.
Mihajlovski, who was presenting a semi-annual report on co-operation between the ministry and the EU police mission, Proxima, stressed that crime fighting depends on a force made up of police professionals, independent of politics and party interests.
In other news, the Macedonian government has decided to destroy the last 30 T-55 tanks donated by Bulgaria six years ago.
The procedure should be completed by the middle of this year as part of efforts to modernise the army.
Also Monday, the EU Council announced that it is adding nine people to its blacklist of extremists obstructing the peace accords in Macedonia.
They are banned from entering EU member states for the next year.

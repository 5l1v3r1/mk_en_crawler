BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The trial against Sandor Kepiro, charged with the murders of 36 Serbs and Jews in Novi Sad in 1942, began in Budapest on Thursday (May 5th).
Kepiro, 97, a former officer of the Hungarian gendarmerie, said he is not guilty and denied having killed anyone, arguing he saved five people instead.
Furthermore, he stated he was not aware the raid targeted Jews or Serbs.
Serbia's war crimes prosecutor's office launched an investigation against Kepiro in 2008.
The case was handed over to Hungary, where prosecutors had opened a probe of their own.

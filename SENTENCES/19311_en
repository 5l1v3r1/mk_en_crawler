SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Thursday (September 28th) that an agreement on police reform could be signed on October 12th or 13th.
Asked what would happen if the September 30th deadline set by the international community is missed, Dodik downplayed the repercussions.
"We have lived through many other deadlines," he said, adding that it is important the agreement is reached before October 15th, when High Representative Miroslav Lajcak will address the EU Council of Ministers.
Dodik reiterated that there would be no compromise regarding efforts to abolish RS police, but said the entity is inclined to make other concessions.

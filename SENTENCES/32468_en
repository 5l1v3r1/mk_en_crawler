SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Security Council is to meet Monday (17 March) to discuss the risks and consequences of possible military operations in Iraq. 
The meeting, called by President Georgi Parvanov, will be attended by the heads of all security services, high-ranking state officials and politicians. 
The presidency and the left-wing opposition BSP have criticised the government for its unconditional support for a second UN resolution against Iraq. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen was also critical, but ruled out any link between Bulgaria's position and EU entry talks.

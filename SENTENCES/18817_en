BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso refused on Wednesday (December 6th) to set a date for Croatia's accession to the EU. 
Speaking after a meeting with Croatian President Stipe Mesic, he said Zagreb must catch up in terms of minority rights, judicial reform and the fight against corruption. 
"The key to the speed of [enlargement] is very much in the hands of Croatia," he said.
Separately, Barroso cautioned Zagreb not to make any unilateral moves regarding establishment of a protected fishing zone in the Adriatic Sea. 
Croatia had promised to exempt EU members Italy and Slovenia from restrictions, but last week Prime Minister Ivo Sanader signalled he was scrapping the deal -- apparently under domestic political pressure. 
In a statement Wednesday, the European Commission sharply criticised Croatia's plans for the zone, saying the country's crediblity as a reliable partner is at stake.
Also on Wednesday, Mesic met in Brussels with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who confirmed that Croatia has the potential to receive an invitation for membership in 2008, as long as criteria are met.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Turkey announced plans on Monday (8 September) to launch its first homemade meteorological satellite by the end of September. 
"For the first time, we didn't just order a satellite but we worked directly on the project and produced its equipment," a representative of the Electronic Research and Scientific Technology Institute said. 
A dozen Turkish experts worked alongside British space engineers to produce the 13m-euro craft.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police have detained eight suspects in connection with the bombing of the Istanbul offices of the ruling Justice and Development Party, according to media reports Wednesday (January 14th). 
An obscure leftist group, the Revolutionary Command, claimed responsibility for the December 1st blast, which killed a policeman and injured nine other people. 
The Revolutionary Command is purportedly linked to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.
In other news Wednesday, police found two hand grenades and 200 rifle bullets in plastic bags at two separate locations in Ankara on Wednesday. 
Earlier this week, they found two other caches of explosives and ammunition in the capital as part of the probe into the shadowy Ergenekon group, which was allegedly plotting a coup.

BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Mayor Mirsad Djapo expects the decision by International Supervisor Susan Johnson to end the application of entity legislation in Brcko would boost both the reform process and the efficiency of local self-government.
In an interview with Nezavisne novine published on Monday (7 August), Djapo added that Johnson had consulted with district authorities prior to issuing her decree last week, and that they had agreed on activities to accelerate the adoption of new laws, in place of those governing Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH.
Johnson's move has been criticised by some Bosnian politicians, who describe it as unilateral.

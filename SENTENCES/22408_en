WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department would like to see tougher laws on the fight against terrorism in Turkey, Dell L. 
Dailey, co-ordinator of the department's Office for Counterterrorism, said on Thursday (September 11th). 
"Tougher laws in Turkey would make the fight against international terror easier," he stressed. 
The two countries share intelligence more than any other pair of nations, he added.
Senior Turkish officials met to discuss counterterrorism in Ankara on Thursday, media reported. 
Several generals and ministers, including the newly appointed chief of the general staff, General Ilker Basbug, attended the meeting under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In other news, Turkish security forces killed four members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in clashes in the southeast province of Sirnak, the general staff announced Thursday on its website. 
The four had escaped after staging a rocket attack Monday on a gendarmerie post in the town of Beytussebap.

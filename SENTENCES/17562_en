ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic's apology to Croats for war-related hardships has prompted different reactions in Croatia and Serbia, according to the regional media. 
The apology, offered during a weekend TV interview in Zagreb where Tadic was attending a regional energy summit, was the first offered by a senior Serbian official. 
Croatian President Stipe Mesic said it was especially significant, as the former Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic had caused the greatest losses to all [in the former Yugoslavia], including Serbs. 
Zoran Milanovic, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, also praised Tadic's statement as evidence of new leadership in Serbia.
In Belgrade, the apology was sharply criticised by the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party and Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. 
The G17 Plus party, however, welcomed it, saying it would help boost bilateral ties and overcome the past.

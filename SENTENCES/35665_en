BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government announced Friday (4 June) that it has drafted a new constitution to replace the one adopted by the Milosevic regime in 1990.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said the new constitution would expand human rights and enhance the separation of powers.
It was not immediately clear when parliament would start debate on the draft.

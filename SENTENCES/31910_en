BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- EU foreign policy and security chief Javier Solana arrived Thursday (28 November) in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica.
The talks focused on determining where Serbian and Montenegrin authorities stand in finalising the constitutional charter of the future Yugoslav federation.
Late Wednesday, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic predicted that Solana would "practically announce" that agreement has been reached.
Likewise, Montenegrin's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists expressed hope that Solana would see the long drafting process wrapped up.

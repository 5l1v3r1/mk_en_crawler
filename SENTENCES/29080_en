BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government faces a self-imposed confidence vote Monday (June 7th) during a joint session of parliament.
The procedure was required to have a set of fiscal austerity measures adopted faster, without the necessity of two readings in each chamber.
One bill reduces expenses in the public administration -- cutting salaries by 25%, as well as subsidies to state-owned companies.
The other one, involving the state social security system, would cut pensions and unemployment benefits by 15%.
Still unclear is whether the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) is unified behind Prime Minister Emil Boc.
This is probably why President Traian Basescu summoned the PDL's parliamentary caucus at the weekend.
Local press reported that Basescu has issued an ultimatum to PDL members, saying that they either back the cabinet, or face going into opposition.
Basescu also indirectly confirmed rumours that a cabinet shuffle is in the works, as was hinted by Ioan Olteanu, vice president of the PDL.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Tuesday (May 27th) the long-awaited start of the government's programme to develop the impoverished provinces in the heavily Kurdish southeast.
The aim is to improve the unity and integrity of the country, said Erdogan.
Poverty in the region has benefited the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party over the past three decades.
The road map would complete the massive 35-year-old South-Eastern Anatolia Project (GAP) by 2012 at a cost of around $20 billion.
Up to now, only 15% of the irrigation projects and 77% of the energy projects have been completed.
In other news Tuesday, the Russian gas giant Gazprom said it would boost daily natural gas deliveries to Turkey until the country manages to repair a pipeline from Iran damaged by a blast Monday.
Gazprom is sending 30 million cubic metres per day, up from 22 million cubic metres per day.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK has formed an investigative team to look into cases of illegal organ transplants at the private Medicus clinic in Pristina, UNMIK spokesperson Russell Geekie said on Saturday (November 15th).
Geekie denied an earlier statement by Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic that the UN mission in Kosovo will also investigate reports of cases of organ harvesting after the 1999 war in Albania.
Meanwhile Friday, the Kosovo police detained an Israeli national on suspicion of negotiating an illegal transplant in the Medicus clinic.
Moshe Harel allegedly organised the arrival in Kosovo of a Turkish donor, as well as of the intended recipient, another Israeli national, said police spokesman Veton Elshani.
Police believe Harel has brokered other such operations.
Two Medicus doctors, the clinic manager and an allegedly complicit health ministry official are also in police custody.

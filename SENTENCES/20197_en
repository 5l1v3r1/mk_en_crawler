SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Economy Minister Vera Rafajlovska resigned on Monday (January 14th) citing personal reasons.
Rafajlovska, of the New Social Democratic Party, denied rumours she was pressured to step down.
Local media reports suggest that Rafajlovska's move stemmed from conflicts within the ruling VMRO-DPMNE.
Recently Rafajlovska and Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavrevski quarrelled over the sell-off of the TEC-Negotino thermal power plant, one of the government's key privatisation projects.
Rafajlovska has openly opposed the plant's privatisation.

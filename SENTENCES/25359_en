ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul expressed certainty Saturday (February 27th) that Turkey will overcome the crisis caused by an investigation into a suspected army plot to topple the government. 
The statement made to Hurriyet came a day after an Istanbul court charged two generals in the case. 
Dubbed the "Sledgehammer", the plot reportedly dates to 2003. 
On Friday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that no-one will be above the law and vowed that everyone who "makes plans behind closed doors" will face justice.
Two of the key suspects are retired General Cetin Dogan, in charge of the Istanbul-based First Army when the plot was allegedly prepared; and General Engin Alan, former commander of the country's Special Forces. 
The court ordered both men to remain in detention. 
The arrests of Dogan and Alan brought the number of suspects in custody since police began their round-up last week to 33.

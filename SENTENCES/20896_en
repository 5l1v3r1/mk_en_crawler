TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi urged parliament and other state institutions to co-operate so reforms to the judicial system can be implemented as soon as possible.
"If reforms in the judicial system will not work, it will be due to a lack of political will," Topi said at a conference Thursday (October 4th) in Vlora.
Topi said he had seen no progress in judicial reforms in the past few months, though crime and corruption remain a serious barrier to the EU integration process.
In other news, Deputy Prime Minister Gazmend Oketa announced plans to downsize the public administration staff by 4,200 people by the end of the year.
He says the cuts are in keeping with institutional reforms.
Also Thursday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha met with union representatives and vowed to focus on safety in the mining industry.
A series of deadly accidents sparked strikes and protests late in the summer.

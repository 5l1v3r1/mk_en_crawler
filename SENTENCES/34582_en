ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan arrived home from London on Tuesday (30 September) saying Britain remains unlikely to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Croatia and the EU unless fugitive General Ante Gotovina is handed over to the UN war crimes tribunal.
In talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Racan said London supports Croatia's efforts to join the EU but insists on full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
In other news Tuesday, Croatia's representative to NATO, Anton Tus, submitted to the Alliance a paper representing the country's annual programme under the NATO membership action plan.
It outlines concrete activities to be taken in the political, security, financial and legal sectors.

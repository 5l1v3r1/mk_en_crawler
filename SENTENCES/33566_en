BUCHAREST, Romania -- Reform of the Romanian Army is advancing as planned, the chairman of NATO Allied Command's Military Committee, General Harold Kujat, said in Bucharest Thursday (18 September).
He added that the purpose of his visit is to get a firsthand impression of progress in restructuring the army and to send a message of full support for Romania's NATO aspirations.
The Alliance strongly appreciates Romania's contribution in the fight against terrorism, Kujat said.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Marc Grossman told reporters after meetings with Kosovo and Serbian leaders on Wednesday (5 November) that all options on the final status of Kosovo remain on the table.
He said the US government has not yet adopted a policy on this issue.
In Belgrade, Grossman said that solving the problem with the Serbian province would move the entire Balkans closer to membership in the EU and NATO.
He reiterated the position of the Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- that there must be "rule of law and security for all ethnic groups" before any discussion of the future status of Kosovo could begin.

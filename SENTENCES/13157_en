HELSINKI, Finland -- Former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, seen as the most likely UN envoy for talks on Kosovo's status, said Saturday (29 October) that NATO must preserve its security role in Kosovo, regardless of the future solution. 
Speaking to the Finnish state-run broadcaster YLE, Ahtisaari said an international military presence was still needed in Kosovo because of persisting problems and the existence of armed groups there. 
He added that he does not favour any particular model for resolving the province's status, adding that time would show whether and what compromise there could be. 
Ahtisaari's formal appointment is expected by 6 November.

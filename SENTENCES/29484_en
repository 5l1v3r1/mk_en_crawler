ANKARA, Turkey -- Four civilians were killed in a landmine explosion in southeast Turkey on Sunday (August 1st), news agencies reported.
The roadside bomb exploded as their vehicle passed down a road in Batman.
Local sources said PKK militants are suspected of carrying out the attack.
The victims of the explosion were reportedly on their way to an oil exploration site where the PKK had set a small fire.
On Monday, the state railway company said a train in the province of Erzincan had been bombed, again by suspected PKK militants.

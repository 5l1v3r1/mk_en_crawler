BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU announced on Thursday (20 October) that initial tests of bird samples from Greece have tested negative for the avian virus, popularly known as bird flu.
The European Commission said, however, that it could not rule out avian flu in Greece altogether.
Protective measures for the island of Oinousses, where a suspicious case was detected, will remain in place.
In Greece the EU statement was overshadowed by media reports that the samples had not been taken properly and the findings may not reflect the actual situation.
Supreme Court prosecutors have launched a probe into the matter.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ratko Mladic continues to enjoy the protection of a security network of Milosevic loyalists, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said on Thursday (11 May).
He said Belgrade is now paying the price for failing to purge hardliners from the government, following the fall of Milosevic in 2000.
Speaking at an OSCE meeting, Draskovic added that there is no excuse for Belgrade's failure to arrest Mladic and deliver him to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In other news, Minister for Local Government Zoran Loncar said after a cabinet meeting on Thursday that he is confident Mladic would be arrested within a few days.
Serbia's former secret service chief Goran Petrovic, however, struck a different chord, describing current police operations against the fugitive as "a farce and a circus".

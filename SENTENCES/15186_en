SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia Regional Court decided on Wednesday (November 29th) to allow the partial confiscation of properties owned by purported drug boss Konstantin Dimitrov-Samokovetsa, who was killed in Amsterdam in 2003.
Under the court's decision, an apartment in Varna, as well as residences in Sofia, would be seized from Dimitrov-Samokovetsa's heirs.
The magistrates were shown evidence that indicated the holdings could not have been bought on his declared income.
Some property in London also is in question.

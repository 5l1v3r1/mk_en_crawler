SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian Chief Prosecutor Nikola Filchev said Thursday (19 May) that politicians are to blame for the lack of judicial reforms. 
He said the current legislation is largely ineffective and does not allow law enforcement and judicial authorities to deal effectively with organised crime. 
Filchev rejected recent accusations that the failure to fight organised crime is the fault of the prosecutor's office, and he insisted the reform should guarantee the prosecution's independence.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A court official told reporters on Wednesday (7 May) that two former security service officials will appear before a Belgrade judge in coming days.
That will initiate a procedure expected to culminate in their extradition to the UN war crimes tribunal.
Former state security chief Jovica Stanisic and his aide, Franko Simatovic, were indicted by the international court on Tuesday for their role in atrocities committed by Serb militias during the 1991-1995 conflicts.
They were arrested following the assassination of Zoran Djindjic, but have not been charged in connection with the slaying.

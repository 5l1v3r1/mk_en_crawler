ANKARA, Turkey -- Two police officers were killed and four others were injured on Thursday (November 27th) after suspected Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists opened fire on a police post in south-eastern Turkey. 
Authorities say three gunmen opened fire near the city of Iskenderun. 
Stray bullets hit a nearby house, injuring three people, including a baby. 
The suspects managed to escape.
In other news Thursday, prosecutors in Diyarbakir filed charges against 11 people suspected of plotting bomb attacks and of belonging to the Muslim Vengeance Brigade Islamism group, which is linked to al-Qaeda, AFP reported. 
The suspects were arrested in August in the Bingol and Mus provinces after police intercepted internet messages and telephone conversations between them. 
Prosecutors say they trained at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan before returning to Turkey to stage terrorist attacks. 
Their trial is expected to begin next month.

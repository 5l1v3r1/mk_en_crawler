SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Muslim working for the Islamic Dzem'ijjetul Furqan humanitarian organisation was arrested Thursday (26 December) for the murders of three members of a Bosnian Croat family.
Mostar police chief Goran Bilic told reporters that the suspect, Muamer Topalovic, appears to have acted alone, but there were indications that others may have been involved.
He said police are assuming the murders were religiously motivated.
Milan Lovric, the head of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) anti-terrorist squad, said checks on Islamic foundations would be stepped up "because some of them have been used as fronts for other activities." BiH's top international official, Paddy Ashdown, and Bosnian Prime Minister Adnan Terzic visited the survivors Thursday.
Ashdown called the murders "profoundly shocking" and a threat to peace in BiH.

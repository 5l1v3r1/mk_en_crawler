PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci started a two-day visit to Tirana on Thursday (June 19th), his first since Kosovo declared independence in February.
Thaci and his Albanian counterpart, Sali Berisha, signed a memorandum of understanding that will pave the way for agreements in all areas in relations between Kosovo and Albania.
Thaci and Berisha reviewed possibilities for co-operation in the energy sector and, in particular, the option to jointly build the future "Kosovo C" power plant.
Both leaders said they would turn Albania and Kosovo into forces for peace, stability, development and regional and European integration.
In other news Thursday, the Opposition for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) party of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj unleashed a wave of criticism of Kosovo's leaders.
The AAK accused the government of dealing with minor projects instead of working on crucial issues concerning all of Kosovo.
AAK spokesman Ernest Luma said that the party wants all institutions and leaders to respect the constitution.
He was referring to President Fatmir Sejdiu's keeping the leadership of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) despite it being banned by the constitution.

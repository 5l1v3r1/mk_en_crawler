BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi said on Saturday (January 9th) that Romania should overcome its "timidity" in relations with the EU.
"We should have a new behaviour.
I am in no way suggesting that we should raise our voice, but we should have our own position and defend more decisively our national interest at the negotiating table," Baconschi said in an interview with public television TVR 1.
Romania snagged an important post in the new European Commission, when Dacian Ciolos was named as the new agriculture commissioner.
His confirmation hearing by the European Parliament is scheduled for Friday.

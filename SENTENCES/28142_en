ANKARA, Turkey -- The army announced on Tuesday (June 22nd) that seven members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and one soldier died in new clashes between the rebels and the army in southeast Turkey. 
Authorities say the PKK opened fire on some barracks in Silvan late Monday, resulting in the deaths of five militants and one soldier. 
In a separate incident, two PKK members were killed and one was arrested in northeast Turkey.
After 12 soldiers were killed in weekend PKK attacks, the National Security Council held an emergency meeting Monday to discuss a new set of strategies to fight terror threats. 
Afterwards, President Abdullah Gul's office announced that the council had decided to impose additional precautions in the short and mid-term, including a review of military personnel deployed in the region.
One possible measure to fight the PKK is the establishment of a professional army deployed at the Iraqi-Turkish border, which would move the Integrated Border Management Project to the top of the agenda. 
The project is expected to cost around 3.7 billion euros, 60% funded by the EU, which has already transferred funds for the initial phase.
Separately Monday, the EU and NATO criticised Kurdish rebel attacks. 
"There is no justification for these terrorist attacks," NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. 
In its statement, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele's office said "What people of Kurdish origin need is stability, peace, prosperity and jobs, not more lives lost." (AFP, Anadolu news agency - 22/06/10; Turkish Daily News, AP, DPA, Hurriyet, AFP - 21/06/10)

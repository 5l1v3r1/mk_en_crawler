SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Local prosecutors indicted Emilia Maslarova, labour minister in the previous cabinet, on Friday (November 12th) for embezzling 5.5m euros in state funds.
According to the indictment, the money was earmarked for renovation of a social services centre in the town of Stara Zagora.
Five others, including two former ministry officials, were also indicted.
The prosecution claims that the group misappropriated the funds by using fake invoices.
Maslarova has given up her immunity as a lawmaker to co-operate with investigators.

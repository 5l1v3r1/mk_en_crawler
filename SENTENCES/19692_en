BRUSSELS, Belgium -- "The first priority for this year is the country's EU agenda," High Representative Miroslav Lajcak told EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Monday (January 21st) in Brussels. 
He added that BiH must now do what is necessary to meet the requirements and sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU this year. 
BiH initialled its SAA last month, but formal endorsement depends on meeting certain conditions, including police reform and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
Prime Minister Nikola Spiric has said BiH will sign the pre-membership agreement by July.

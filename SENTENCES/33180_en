ZUPANJA, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan and members of the government's crisis centre visited Vukovar-Srijem County on Wednesday (14 May) to assess drought damage. 
The agriculture ministry projects farmers might lose 132m euros this year due to weather conditions. 
The ministry declared a state of emergency in nearly a half of the farming districts.
In Romania, state authorities warned the spring drought might reduce the grain yield by as much as 50 per cent. 
The agriculture ministry is seeking more funds to improve the irrigation system, which currently covers less than 20 per cent of cultivated land.

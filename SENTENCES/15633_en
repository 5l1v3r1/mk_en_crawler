BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the main Serb formation in BiH, the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), held talks Wednesday (October 25th) with the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) about forming a coalition.
Following the talks, SNSD general secretary Igor Radojicic said that SDA, together with the multiethnic SDP, would be a "preferred coalition partner" at the central level.
SNSD leader Milorad Dodik, meanwhile, said that his party and the SDS have agreed to put aside differences and co -operate on issues crucial to Republika Srpska's interests.
The situation could become even more complicated if SDA partners with the Party for BiH both at the entity level in the Federation of BiH -- as seems to be happening -- and at the state level.

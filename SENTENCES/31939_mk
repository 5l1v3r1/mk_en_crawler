BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica insisted Saturday (26 October) on direct presidential elections in Serbia, rather than a parliamentary vote. 
"The Serbian people must vote for the Serbian president because the post gives Serbia stability on its path to transition," Kostunica said. 
His Democratic Party of Serbia has submitted draft amendments to the election laws in a bid to avoid a situation in which low turnout could deadlock the presidential elections.

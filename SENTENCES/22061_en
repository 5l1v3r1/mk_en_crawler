BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic announced on Sunday (July 20th) that he will propose ambassadors recalled from EU states that recognised Kosovo be allowed to return to their posts. 
"The ministry ... 
decided to propose at its next session on Thursday to return Serbian ambassadors to EU states that were called [to Belgrade] for consultations," Jeremic told reporters, adding that doing so would improve ties with the EU that the previous government's decision strained unnecessarily.
Serbian Democratic Party official Slobodan Samardzic, who served as minister for Kosovo, said on Sunday that Jeremic's proposal represents "a capitulation" by Serbia.

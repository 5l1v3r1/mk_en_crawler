SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Saturday (December 26th) that Bosnian Serb authorities will look through the recently completed state property inventory in mid to late January but stressed that RS will not give up property. 
The inventory was conducted by the Office of the High representative (OHR), after Bosnian authorities failed to start the process. 
Resolving the state property issue is one of five objectives established by the Peace Implementation Council to transition the OHR into the Office of the EU's Special Representative.

BERN, Switzerland -- The Swiss government has appointed chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte as its ambassador to Argentina. 
The Swiss Foreign Ministry said on Thursday (23 August) that she will travel to Buenos Aires in January immediately after the end of her term with the UN. 
The former Swiss chief prosecutor initially intended to step down in September but was persuaded to wait until the end of the year while the UN searched for a successor.

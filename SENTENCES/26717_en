TIRANA, Albania -- The newly-elected parliament held its first session Monday (September 7th) with 79 new members within its ranks -- 40 members of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), and 36 members of the ruling Democratic Party (DP). 
But as promised, the SP members boycotted the session to protest what the party describes as manipulation of the June 28th general elections. 
SP leader Edi Rama said on Monday that one precondition for his party's return would be to draft a law on investigating elections, to determine what happened in June. 
The OSCE office in Albania issued a statement Monday criticising the SP's boycott. 
Meanwhile, the DP reached an agreement Monday with its ally, the Republican Party, to give it the environment minister post in the new government, as well as two deputy minister positions.

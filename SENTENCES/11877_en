ATHENS, Greece -- A wave of strikes paralysed Greece on Thursday (17 March), involving employees in public transport, schools, banks, post offices and utilities.
Olympic Airlines and the Hellenic Railway Organisation were among those affected.
The strikes were jointly organised by the two major trade unions -- the syndicate of civil servants and the union of private sector employees.
The unions say the 24-hour strike is meant to protest rising unemployment and high inflation.
In other news, British Army Chief of Staff General Michael Walker arrived on a three-day visit to Greece Wednesday.
He is meeting with senior military officials to discuss issues related to bilateral co-operation, as well as NATO and the EU.

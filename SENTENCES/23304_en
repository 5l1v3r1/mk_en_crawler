BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Supreme Court has confirmed the 40-year prison terms handed to Milorad "Legija" Ulemek and Zvezdan Jovanovic for the March 2003 assassination of then Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, local media reported on Saturday (December 27th). 
The Court also confirmed the sentences handed down to ten co-defendants in the case. 
The decision, however, has not yet been officially published, as it is being reviewed for consistency and compliance with judicial practices and laws. 
Ulemek and Jovanovic will have another chance to lodge appeals, because they received the maximum sentences. 
The Special Court for Organised Crime convicted them in May 2007.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government announced on Thursday (December 25th) that Montenegro will compensate relatives of scores of Bosnian Muslim refugees whom Bosnian Serbs killed after Montenegrin authorities repatriated them to their homeland during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia.
The government has authorised the state attorney to formally conclude a compensation agreement with the victims of deportations and members of their families who had filed charges against the state, Justice Minister Miras Radovic told reporters.
The total amount of the compensation will be 4.1m euros, he added.
Authorities in Montenegro arrested and then repatriated at least 83 Bosnian Muslims in early 1992 after they had fled fighting.
Bosnian Serb forces killed most of them.
At least nine survived imprisonment by the same forces.
In 2004, they filed lawsuits against Montenegro, along with families of other victims.
Compensation for the nine will range from 10,000 euros to 170,000 euros, depending on the length of their imprisonment.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- In an interview with Vecernji List published Monday (23 May), Prime Minister Ivo Sanader dismissed the possibility of a government shuffle in the wake of the ruling Croatian Democratic Party's (HDZ) showing in the recent municipal elections.
Sanader, who is also the HDZ leader, also rejected the possibility of early elections.
He said the remaining two and a half years of the government's mandate would be characterised by political stability.

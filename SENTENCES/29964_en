ANKARA, Turkey -- Six senior politicians from the far-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP) resigned on Saturday (May 21st) over compromising sex videos. 
The tapes showing politicians in extramarital affairs were posted on Internet by the "Different Nationalists" group. 
Similar secretly filmed videos have already triggered four resignations among the MHP. 
The videos were released ahead of the June 12th general elections. 
According to recent polls the MHP enjoys 10% support among the voters which is the threshold for entering the parliament.

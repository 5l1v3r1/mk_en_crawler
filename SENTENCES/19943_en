TIRANA, Albania -- The government requested a UN disaster assessment and co-ordination team Wednesday (March 19th) to help authorities deal with the aftermath of a series of deadly explosions Saturday at a military ammunition depot. 
At least 18 people were killed and more than 300 were injured after a series of blasts during efforts to destroy old military ordnance at a depot in Gerdec. 
General prosecutor Ina Rama has also asked the United States to participate in the investigation with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, in part by providing more information on a US company linked to the situation and by helping to identify bodies recovered so far.
At a parliamentary session Wednesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha accused local media of manipulating coverage of Saturday's blasts. 
Broadcasters have released video shot before the explosion showing children working at the depot, but Berisha denies that children were on the payroll. 
Opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama responded by organising a peaceful protest Thursday against hiring children to work in gun factories.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes court on Monday (September 28th) sentenced a Bosnian national to 12 years in prison for actions committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Ilija Jurisic was found guilty of ordering an attack against a former Yugoslav National Army convoy withdrawing from Tuzla in May 1992.
At least 51 soldiers were killed and 50 were wounded in the attack.
Jurisic's lawyer called the verdict "scandalous" and vowed to appeal.

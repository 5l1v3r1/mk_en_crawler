SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) turned down an invitation Monday (November 9th) from the president of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, Sulejman Tihic, for talks on constitutional changes.
The SDP says it will respond only to invitations from the EU and the United States.
Two such sessions last month ended without any agreement on reforms that would move BiH towards NATO and EU integration.
Tihic has asked leaders of the main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties to meet Thursday in order to continue talks aimed at breaking the longstanding political stalemate.
Haris Silajdzic, of the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the first to reject that overture.

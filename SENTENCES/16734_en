STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) on Wednesday (6 September) endorsed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania, a key step towards eventual EU membership.
In a special resolution, the EP praised the reforms implemented so far and encouraged the transformation of Albania into a "pluralist democracy respecting the rule of law, with a functioning market economy".
At the same time, deputies stressed that Tirana has a lot more work to do, particularly with regard to electoral reforms, institutional and legal frameworks, and fighting corruption and organised crime.
Albania and the EU signed the SAA in June, following three years of negotiations.

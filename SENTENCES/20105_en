BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica spoke out against seeking membership in NATO on Saturday (September 15th). 
"Serbia should retain full military neutrality ... 
its state and national interest is to remain outside any military alliances," he told a gathering of Democratic Party of Serbia leaders. 
He said the issue would be further complicated if NATO members recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo.
"How could Serbia join a military alliance which first bombards us, then comes to Kosovo using military forces and in the end, evades the UN's Security Council and â¦ recognises the unilaterally declared independence of an organic part of our country?" Kostunica said.

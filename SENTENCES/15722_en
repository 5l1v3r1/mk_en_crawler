ZAGREB, Croatia -- The agriculture ministry reported on Saturday (October 21st) a new outbreak of swine fever in the eastern Osijek-Baranja County. 
Officials say it has killed some 100 pigs in a farm between Dalj and Erdut. 
The ministry said that some 3,600 pigs would be culled in the region, to prevent further spreading of the disease. 
The fever has prompted the culling of some 2,500 animals in Croatia since July.

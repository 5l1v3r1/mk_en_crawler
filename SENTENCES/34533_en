TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu urged Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Sunday (5 October) to nominate a new foreign minister. 
The post has been vacant since 18 July when Ilir Meta crossed swords with Nano and left the cabinet. 
No replacement has been found, raising concerns that the country is not properly represented abroad.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Thursday (May 27th) welcomed the European Commission's (EC) decision to recommend abolishing visas for Albanians. 
He also pledged to quickly implement criteria set as conditions for visa-free travel. 
"I guarantee all member states that all three criteria will be addressed with the utmost commitment and application by the government," Berisha said. 
Opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama sent a letter to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, expressing gratitude for the decision and said the right to visa-free travel should not be affected by Albania's ongoing political crisis.

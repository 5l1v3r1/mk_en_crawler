ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A bus packed with guests en route to a wedding Saturday (7 June) slammed into the entrance of a tunnel in eastern Turkey, killing 27 people and injuring a dozen others, some of them critically, authorities said. 
The accident occurred at 1 am local time outside the city of Erzincan, 700 km east of Ankara. 
The privately chartered bus was taking wedding party members from Sivas to Ahmet Bey, a tiny village outside the city of Agri. 
The brother of the bride was reportedly among the dead. 
Authorities suspect the driver fell asleep at the wheel.

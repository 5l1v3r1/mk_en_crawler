TIRANA, Albania -- In a ruling Friday (7 April), Tirana District Court endorsed the demolition of a recently built overpass in the capital, Zog i Zi, which has been the subject of a dispute between city authorities and the central government.
The court rejected an appeal submitted by Tirana Mayor Edi Rama, who also leads the main opposition Socialist Party.
The National Council of Territory Adjustment, controlled by the governing Democratic Party, has ordered Zog i Zi to be torn down on the grounds that a feasibility study was not conducted.
The municipal authorities claim that a study was, in fact, drafted.
In other news, Albanian Deputy Minister of Environment Taulant Bino said Friday that licensed fishing boats were not included in a newly-adopted three-year ban on the private possession and circulation of speedboats.
Bino's comment came after local fishermen threatened protests.

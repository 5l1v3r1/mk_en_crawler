Macedonia's ruling VMRO-DPMNE, in collaboration with the Berlin-based Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAF) and the Pavel Satev Institute in Skopje, organised a seminar on political management and diplomacy as part of the German foundation's outreach to the Balkan country.
Young participants flocked to the seminar, which ran from October 26th to November 2nd.
The KAF -- named after the former West Germany's first chancellor -- opened its office in Skopje in 2000, where it began offering political education to students, young politicians and journalists.
The KAF conducts more than 200 projects in more than 120 countries around the world.
Its principal goals include consolidation of democracy and promotion of European unification.
Eminent politicians and professors from Macedonia and abroad gave lectures at the seminar, formally known as the Sixth Political Academy on Political Management and Diplomacy.
Included in their number were Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski, Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki.
"Quality education is part of the basic priorities of VMRO-DPMNE, and we support the goal of raising the level of political intelligence among the Macedonian people.
The Academy is proof of successful co-operation with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation," Gruevski said in his remarks.
The seminar was called the Sixth Political Academy because five previous ones have trained more than 400 mostly younger participants for future roles in Macedonian political life.
The president of the Pavel Satev Institute, Pande Lazarevski, described the academy as evidence of a joint KAF-Macedonian effort to offer solutions for Macedonia's problems.
Gruevski handed out certificates of completion at the academy's graduation ceremony.

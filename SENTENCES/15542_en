PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The European Commission (EC) is expected to open an office in Montenegro in September, in light of the launch of separate Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the newly independent state, according to the head of the EC Directorate for the Western Balkans, Reinhard Priebe.
He met on Tuesday (25 July) with Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic and Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic in Podgorica.
They praised the EU Council's decision earlier this week to endorse a separate SAA negotiation mandate for Montenegro, following the breakup of the loose union with Serbia.

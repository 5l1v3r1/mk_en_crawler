NEW YORK, United States -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told a press conference Friday (September 28th) that the bloc will not take a side in the Turkish dispute over lifting a ban on Islamic headscarves in colleges and universities.
The issue is "a matter of domestic debate", said Rehn, who was attending the UN General Assembly session in New York.
He reiterated the EU's call for the new Turkish constitution to "enhance freedoms, especially freedom of expression and religion".

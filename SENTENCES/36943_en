SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Wednesday (30 June) issued a decree dismissing General Dimitar Vladimirov from his post as head of the National Guard Service.
The move was in response to recent reports linking the service to criminal groups.
General Rumen Milanov, formerly head of the National Service for the Fight Against Organised Crime, will replace Vladimirov.

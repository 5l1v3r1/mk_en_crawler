SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Friday (8 October) that revising the BiH Constitution is an internal issue, up to the BiH state and its citizens.
During a presentation to the Council of Europe's advisory arm for constitutional matters, the Venice Commission, Ashdown said the international community does not oppose constitutional changes but it would be up to BiH to decide on future steps for evolution and Euro-Atlantic integration.
"Dayton and the BiH Constitution should be viewed as the foundation and not the ceiling," said Ashdown.
He added that BiH politicians could handle their own problems with constitutional amendments and make BiH a stable, functional and prosperous state.

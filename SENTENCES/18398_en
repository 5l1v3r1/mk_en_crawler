ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country will need to invest up to 11 billion euros in environmental protection to meet all EU requirements in that area, according to a report in Tuesday's (April 10th) local daily Poslovni dnevnik.
The money will come from various budget sources, as well as through EU pre- and post-accession funds.
However, the Croatian government must demonstrate a much better capacity to absorb EU financing, according to members of the team negotiating accession with the EU.

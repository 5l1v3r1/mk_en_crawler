MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Croatian government will rebuild 58 houses in the Bosnian town of Bugojno to help the return of refugees, local authorities announced Sunday (25 May). 
The programme will be financed by the government and will start in the middle of June. 
The displaced families are mainly Bosnian Croats forced to leave their homes due to the conflicts in the 1990s. 
They ended up living in Croatia.
In other news, 17 Croatian NGOs have drafted a law for access to information in public institutions. 
The bill is scheduled to be discussed Monday at the meeting of the Croatian Helsinki Committee on Human Rights. 
The organisations launched the initiative in March, noting Croatia is the only transition country without such a law.

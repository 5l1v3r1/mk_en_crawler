ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is defending legislation that limits the power of military courts, in a document submitted to President Abdullah Gul, local newspapers reported on Wednesday (July 8th). 
The government urges Gul to sign the bill, passed by parliament last month, saying it complies with the constitution, Turkey's Accession Partnership Agreement with the EU, as well as the European Commission's progress reports on Turkey. 
But the army opposes the measure, claiming it contradicts Article 145 of the constitution, regarding military justice.
The new bill paves the way for civilian courts to try military personnel in peace time for anti-government activities, threats to national security, constitutional violations and organised crime. 
It also transfers to civilian courts the power to try civilians in peace time for offenses that currently fall under the military penal code.

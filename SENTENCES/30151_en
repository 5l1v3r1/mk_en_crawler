WARSAW, Poland -- Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said on Wednesday (January 19th) that his government will go ahead with a planned fence along its border with Turkey to stop the influx of illegal immigrants into the EU. 
"We are taking action while at once preserving a human face and respecting all our obligations under international law," Droutsas said. 
He was speaking to journalists after meeting with Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski in Warsaw. 
They discussed Poland's upcoming EU presidency in the second half of 2011, the EU integration of the Western Balkans and bilateral relations.
In other news Tuesday, Bulgaria announced plans to build a wall along its border with Turkey, this one to keep out straying animals infected with foot and mouth disease. 
Agriculture and Food Minister Miroslav Naydenov said the planned 140km fence will be discussed with EU and Turkish experts after two outbreaks of the disease in the villages of Rezovo and Kosti forced authorities to cull animals there.

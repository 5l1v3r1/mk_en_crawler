PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Citizens of Kosovo are losing faith in EULEX, a report published on Sunday (May 29th) concludes. 
The document, drafted by the Kosovo-based Balkans Institute for Policies (IPOL), said that the EU rule of law mission has been losing public trust since January and that the current level of trust is comparable to that in 2008. 
Institute Director Seb Bytyci says that some arrests EULEX made last year helped boost feelings that EULEX is doing its job. 
However, this month the percentage of satisfaction has dropped. 
IPOL says the cause may be deteriorating relations between EULEX and national institutions, and that statements by some government officials against the mission is influencing public perception of it. 
Bytyci says the lack of trust between EULEX and Kosovo institutions is obstructing the mission's efforts to fulfil its mandate.

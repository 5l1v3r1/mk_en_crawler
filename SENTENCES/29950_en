ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday (January 23rd) criticised an Israeli report on the raid against a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine Turkish activists dead in May.
The report concluded that the raid did not violate international law.
"How can a report ordered and prepared in the same country [Israel] have any value," Erdogan noted.
"We will follow this affair.
This report has no credibility," he added.
Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, praised the findings of the document.
"I hope all those who rushed to judgment against Israel and its soldiers will read this report and learn the truth about what happened," he said.
Turkey has set up its own commission to investigate the incident, which concluded in a preliminary report that "the force used to intercept the Mavi Marmara exceeded the limits of what was appropriate and necessary." Ankara insists on an official apology from Israel and compensation for families of the victims.

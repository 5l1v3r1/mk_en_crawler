ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey will meet the EU's Maastricht accession criteria by 2007, State Minister Ali Babacan said on Sunday (14 December).
He added that there would be no delays in repaying loans from the IMF this year.
Commenting on the high inflation rate, the minister said the growth in prices has slowed and that this process would eventually result in lower inflation.
He cited the need to reduce unemployment as the most challenging issue at present.

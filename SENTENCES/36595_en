ATHENS, Greece -- This month's Olympics in Athens will become the starting point of a new economic course for the country, Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said Monday (2 August). 
He added that the Games would help Greece prove the high quality of its goods and services, improve its international image and boost interest among foreign investors. 
More than 600 foreign companies responded to the ministry's invitation to discuss business deals with Greek companies during the Games, he said.
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times is running an article Tuesday that reads in part: "The Greek government and Olympic organisers appear to have accomplished what many critics considered beyond their reach: The sports venues are built, the roads are finished, the trains are running, the athletes' village is open and ticket sales are on the up tick."

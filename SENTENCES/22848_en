MADRID, Spain -- Spain will not change its position on Kosovo's independence, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on Saturday (July 5th) after meeting with his Serbian counterpart, Vuk Jeremic, in Madrid. 
"The framework for our action is that stability in the region must be secured," Moratinos said. 
"We have talked about the EULEX deployment, and I hope that as a new Serbian government is formed, we will be able to make progress in EU engagement in the region." Jeremic said that Serbia's new government will co-operate with the UN to find a solution to restructuring UNMIK that is acceptable to Serbia and that enjoys the support of the UN Security Council.

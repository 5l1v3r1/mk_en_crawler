BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Thursday (27 April) that withdrawing Romania's military force from Iraq is out of question, despite the death Wednesday of a Romanian soldier.
He was killed in an attack on a vehicle transporting a joint Romanian and Italian force in southern Iraq.
"Romania must assume its responsibilities as a member of NATO and contribute to ensure security in Iraq," Tariceanu said.
Romania has 860 troops in Iraq and 492 in Afghanistan.

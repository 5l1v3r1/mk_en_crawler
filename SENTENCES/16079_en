VIENNA, Austria -- The International Atomic Energy Agency says a defunct reactor near Belgrade is the most dangerous nuclear site in the world and a potential target for terrorists. 
According to the agency, 2.5 tonnes of nuclear waste are stored at Vinca, some 16km from Belgrade. 
The site is poorly guarded and could become a source of supplies for terrorists who want to produce a "dirty bomb", the agency says. 
Thousands of spent fuel rods containing uranium and plutonium are stored there and many of the containers were found to be leaking. 
The research reactor was closed 22 years ago.

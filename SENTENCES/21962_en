TIRANA, Albania -- Leaders of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and its party caucus met on Thursday (April 17th) in a bid to find common ground on potential constitutional changes, particularly election reform. 
Some in the party want the president elected directly by voters, while Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who heads the party, supports parliament electing the president. 
He is willing, however, to consider minor changes to facilitate the process. 
Negotiations with coalition allies over the issue continue.

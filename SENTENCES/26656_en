BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Monday (November 9th) that he expects European Parliament members to decide to accelerate the visa liberalisation process for Serbian citizens at their session Thursday. 
Djelic says that decision will be a strong indicator of the final one, expected by December 1st. 
Slovenia has proposed early implementation of the visa-free regime for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro starting on December 19th, instead of January 1st, as suggested by the European Commission.

Life expectancy at birth in the EU has increased from an average of 72 years in 1980 to 78 years in 2007, the European Commission (EC) and the OECD said in a new study published on Tuesday (December 7th).
Numerous factors, including lower mortality rates and higher living standards, improved lifestyle, better education and greater access to quality health care have contributed to this, the 130-page "Health at a Glance:
Europe 2010" report noted.
The paper covers the bloc's 27 member states, EU candidates Iceland and Turkey, as well as Norway and Switzerland.
For women, the life expectancy at birth was found to range from an average of 84.4 years in France to 76.4 years in Bulgaria and Lithuania, 76.2 years in Romania and 75.3 years in Turkey.
Among men, life expectancy was highest in Iceland, at 79.5 years, and was lowest in Lithuania (65.1), Latvia (65.5) and Estonia (67.3).
Ischemic heart disease (IHD, or heart attack) and cerebral-vascular disease, or stroke, remained the biggest causes of deaths in the EU in 2008.
Together, they accounted for 60% of all cardiovascular deaths, and caused one-quarter of all deaths in the bloc, according to the report.
The highest IHD mortality rates for both men and women were registered in the Central and Eastern European countries, particularly in Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia and Estonia.
Within the bloc, stroke caused the largest number of deaths in Bulgaria and Romania.
Cancer, the second leading cause of mortality in EU countries after cardiovascular diseases and strokes, accounted for 26% of all deaths in 2008.
According to the report, Cyprus was the country with the lowest cancer mortality rate two years ago.
"Death rates from all types of cancer for males and females have declined at least slightly in most EU countries since 1994, although the decline has been more modest than for cardiovascular diseases," the paper noted.
"The exceptions to this declining pattern are among Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) and Greece, where cancer mortality has remained static or increased between 1994 and 2008."
Bulgaria, Romania, Malta and Turkey were the nations with the highest infant mortality rates, ranging from 8.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in Bulgaria to 17.0 deaths in Turkey, while Luxembourg scored best with just 1.8 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Of all surveyed countries, Greece and Bulgaria were found to have the highest daily smoking rates in 2008.
Smoking, a key health risk factor, is still significant among the bloc's younger population as well, the report warned.
Another key finding was that the rate of obesity has more than doubled over the past two decades.
In 2008, more than half of adults and one in seven children living in the EU were overweight or obese, the OECD and the EC said.
"This has considerable implications for the costs of health care," the two institutions warned.

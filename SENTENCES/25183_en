WASHINGTON, United States -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Valentin Inzko on Wednesday (November 25th) briefed US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg on the situation in BiH, saying it is worrisome. 
At a meeting in Washington, after presenting a report on BiH's recent progress at the UN headquarters in New York, Inzko voiced support for the US-EU initiative to bring Bosnian political leaders to the negotiating table in order to discuss reforms. 
Constitutional changes are the main precondition for a functional state, and for strong state institutions that will enable the country to join the EU and NATO, Inzko said.

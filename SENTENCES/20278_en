SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Twelve party candidates and two independents will run in the upcoming snap elections for president of Republika Srpska, the BiH Central Elections Commission announced after the registration deadline Tuesday (October 16th). 
The election, scheduled for December 9th, was prompted by the death last month of incumbent Milan Jelic.

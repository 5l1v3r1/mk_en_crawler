NEW YORK, United States -- On Thursday (31 July), a federal judge ordered the Uzan family to pay more than $4 billion in damages to Motorola.
Judge Jed Rakoff also found the members of the Turkish family in contempt of court and ordered their immediate arrest if found in the United States.
The Uzans were found guilty of pocketing $1 billion from a $1.8 billion loan Motorola provided to their Telsim wireless phone company.
Finnish giant Nokia was similarly defrauded.
The US court awarded Nokia 7.5 per cent of Telsim's stock as compensation.
Telsim CEO Hakan Uzan said he would appeal the ruling.

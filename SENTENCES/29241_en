ANKARA, Turkey -- An explosion in southeast Turkey late Saturday (July 3rd) damaged a section of pipeline carrying oil from Iraq, a security official said.
The blast damaged part of the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline in Mardin province, causing a fire that burned until early Sunday.
Authorities suspect members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) were behind the bombing, prompting a security operation in the region.
In other news, police killed one Kurdish rebel and injured another who tried to attack a police building in the town of Cizre, in the southeast Sirnak province late Friday.
Sources say the two suspects, wearing civilian clothes, opened fire on police officers.
Several hand grenades were allegedly found on them.

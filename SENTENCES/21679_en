ANKARA, Turkey -- Constitutional Court Chairman Hasim Kilic told reporters on Friday (May 23rd) that the court will rule on the controversial headscarf case in the first week of June.
"No matter what the decision is, you will see that our democracy, our secular order and our laws will be empowered after this process," Kilic said.
In February, parliament passed a bill amending the constitution, which effectively lifted the headscarf ban in universities.
The move sparked concerns about the future of secularism and prompted the main opposition Republican People's Party to demand that the amendment be annulled.

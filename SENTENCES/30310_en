SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The election campaign for the June 5th parliamentary elections kicked off officially at midnight Sunday (May 15th). 
Parties, coalitions and independent candidates will have 20 days to woo voters. 
The State Election Commission has confirmed 18 lists of candidates who will take part in the race from six electoral units. 
There will be three new electoral units for Macedonians living abroad. 
The voting process will be monitored by OSCE representatives and local observers.
Hours before the campaign's start, the main opposition SDSM protested outside the government building in Skopje, frustrated that municipal authorities refused to let them rally inside the city's stadium. 
The SDSM estimates 60,000-70,000 people attended the rally. 
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE holds its first campaign rally on Monday in Ohrid.

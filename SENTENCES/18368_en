ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities are on high alert over a possible new terror attack, the largest newspapers reported on Friday (May 11th).
The increased vigilance follows a statement sent to the second largest newspaper, Pondiki, in which the terror organisation "Revolutionary Fight" made death threats against a number of officials, including Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Public Order Minister Viron Polydoras.
The organisation has claimed responsibility for an attack on a police station in Athens on April 30th.

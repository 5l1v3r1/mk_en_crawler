BELGRADE, Serbia -- Spanish Ambassador to Belgrade Inigo de Palacio Espana, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, was quoted Thursday (January 14th) as saying that the EU has begun consultations on Serbia's membership application, submitted last month. 
The EU will hold a ministerial-level meeting with Serbian officials on January 26th to inform them of the bloc's position. 
Espana said Spain strongly favours Serbia's closer EU integration and will insist that the European Commission draft a recommendation giving Belgrade candidate status. 
Serbia hopes to become a formal EU candidate this year.

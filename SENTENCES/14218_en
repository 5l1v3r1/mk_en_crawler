BRUSSELS, Belgium -- French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy told a meeting of his EU counterparts on Monday (12 December) that the Union must reconsider plans for further enlargement in view of the current impasse over its 2007-2013 budget.
France also declined to support a recommendation by the European Commission to grant Macedonia the status of a candidate for membership.
Macedonia's candidacy will now be discussed at the EU leaders' summit on Thursday and Friday.
France has indicated that it would like to defer the formal recognition of Skopje as a candidate for six months and hold a Union-wide debate on enlargement prior to that.

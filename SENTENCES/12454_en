ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Erhard Busek, is not ruling out a possible delay in EU membership talks with Croatia, currently scheduled to begin on 17 March. 
The hitch could be insufficient co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, according to a statement quoted by Zagreb media Tuesday (8 February).

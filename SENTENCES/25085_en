SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko on Thursday (October 29th) reassured UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz that he is ready to use his authority to guarantee BiH's full co-operation with The Hague.
He stressed that this co-operation is a priority for his office.
Brammertz, in turn, voiced concern that international judges and prosecutors' mandates in BiH were not extended, saying extensions are in the interest of the fight against impunity.
Brammertz arrived in Sarajevo on Wednesday.

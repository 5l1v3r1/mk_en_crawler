PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Norwegian Ambassador to Kosovo Sverre Johan Kvale wants to see Ramush Haradinaj released from detention until his war crimes trial at The Hague begins. 
In a letter he sent as a "private citizen" in defence of Haradinaj, Kvale "gave full support" to the efforts of Haradinaj's lawyers to return their client to Kosovo, Belgrade-based media reported on Monday (August 9th). 
"Haradinaj is much needed as a political player in Kosovo, not only for his party but even more for building a stable democracy," Kvale wrote. 
Citing witness intimidation, the tribunal's Appeals Chamber ordered a partial retrial last month for the former Kosovo prime minister, along with two other former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders suspected of committing war crimes. 
No date has been announced for the retrial.

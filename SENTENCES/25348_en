ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of farmers protested in downtown Athens on Monday (January 25th), demanding additional state subsidies and higher prices for their produce.
Last week, the protestors blocked some of the main highways and borders with Bulgaria.
They are determined to continue the action until demands are met.
The protest has racked up losses in both Bulgaria and Romania, prompting those governments to seek compensation via the European Commission.
On Monday, Greek Agriculture Minister Katerina Batzeli proposed a package of measures for the farmers, pledging that 2009 subsidies will be fully paid by the end of February, while subsidies for 2010 will be paid without delay before the end of the year.
Public sector workers upset with Greek austerity measures to cut a huge budget deficit plan to hold a day-long strike next month, and may be joined by unions from the private sector.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, on Monday (18 July) defended the Union's decision to open accession talks with Turkey in October.
During a meeting of EU foreign ministers, he deflected attempts by two of the member-states to open a debate on Turkey's recognition of Cyprus and on substituting full membership with "privileged partnership".
The meeting coincided with the publication of the European Commission's regular survey, called Eurobarometer.
It found that 52 per cent of people in the 25-nation bloc oppose Ankara's membership, compared to 35 per cent who support it.
In other news, Turkish police are looking for a man in his twenties who is suspected of planting a bomb in a minivan Saturday that killed five people and injured 13.
According to local media reports Monday, the suspect boarded the van three times as it ferried tourists to a beach.
He carried a bag on his last trip and got off just minutes before the blast.

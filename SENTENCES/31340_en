ANKARA, Turkey -- Cabinet ministers told the media on Tuesday (29 April) that relations between the government and the military were normal, following a brief spat over the separation of religion and the state.
"In my opinion everything is on track and there is no extraordinary situation," Culture Minister Erkan Mumcu told a local news agency.
Last week, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the opposition Republican People's Party and top military commanders refused to attend an official reception, protesting the use of head scarves by the wives of several Justice and Development Party lawmakers.
Turkish secularists see the wearing of scarves in government offices and at official events as a violation of the separation of religion and state.
The issue will likely be discussed at Wednesday's regular monthly meeting of the National Security Council, composed of both political and military leaders.
In other news, the Turkish news channel NTV reported Tuesday that Ankara looks favourably on the idea of sending peacekeeping forces to Iraq if they would be under US command, but not if they would be under UK or Polish command.

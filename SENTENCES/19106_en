WASHINGTON, United States -- A new government report on copyright violations worldwide places Turkey in the group of worst offenders. 
Eleven other nations made the so-called "priority watch list", which means the US government could impose economic sanctions and bring trade cases against these countries before the World Trade Organisation. 
Romania was among 31 states on the lower level of the watch, while Bulgaria and Croatia were dropped from the list altogether.

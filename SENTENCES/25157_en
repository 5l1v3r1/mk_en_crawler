LUXEMBOURG -- The Netherlands has not changed its stance on Serbia and will continue to block implementation of the EU's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade.
This is because Serbia has not demonstrated full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said on Wednesday (October 28th) in Luxembourg.
In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti, Verhagen said there hasn't been much progress in meeting commitments to the tribunal, particularly arresting remaining fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
Therefore, she said, the Dutch government has decided that Serbia's interim trade accord, which is part of the SAA, cannot be put into effect.

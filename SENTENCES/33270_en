SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Expectations for Macedonia's accession to NATO in 2007 are realistic, according to Macedonian Army Brigadier General Mile Manolev, who heads a Skopje-based NGO called Centre for Security Policy. 
In an interview with the Macedonian Information Agency, Manolev said the country has accomplished a lot and is continuing efforts to make its defence structure compatible with NATO. 
Although Macedonia's citizens generally support the idea of NATO membership, Manolev said a referendum on the issue should take place.

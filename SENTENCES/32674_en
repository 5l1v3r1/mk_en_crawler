SKOPJE, Macedonia -- VMRO-DPMNE's Central Committee approved changes in the party statute at its meeting Sunday (22 December). 
While leaders declined to provide details, sources say the new statute gives broader powers to party leader Ljubco Georgievski and limits the influence of regional party organisations. 
The changes aim to strengthen Georgievski's position in the party prior to the national congress, which is to take place in late May. 
The committee also supported Georgievski's decision not to take part in a meeting later this week of Ohrid peace accord signatories, despite pressure from the international community.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF's Executive Board on Wednesday (July 8th) approved a $1.57 billion loan for BiH to help the country cope with the effects of the global financial crisis.
The IMF said it would disburse $282m immediately and the remainder in instalments, subject to quarterly reviews.
"Corrective policies adopted by the authorities, along with international financial support, will contribute to realising an orderly adjustment," IMF Deputy Managing Director Takatoshi Kato said in a statement.

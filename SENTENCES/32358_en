ZAGREB, Croatia -- Minister of European Integration Neven Mimica generally approves of the report released last week by the European Commission on the country's stabilisation and association reforms. 
In an interview Friday (28 March), Mimica called the document an upgrade that would increase the country's chances of starting EU accession negotiations in the short term. 
The report emphasised Croatia's progress in regional co-operation, legislative reforms for the return of refugees, pensions and economic reforms. 
But EU officials recommended further efforts to improve relations with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, media regulation, judiciaries, privatisation, social protection, and integration of the Roma population. 
Mimica's ministry pledged to draft an action plan to tackle weaknesses cited in the report.

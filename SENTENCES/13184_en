ZAGREB, Croatia -- It is not clear whether Croatia will be invited to join NATO this year, NATO Deputy Secretary General Alessandro Minuto Rizzo said Thursday (23 February) during a lecture at a Zagreb law school, adding that the country will join the Alliance once it meets the requirements.
At the same time, he stressed that Croatia is demonstrating its interest, given its willingness to participate in NATO operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

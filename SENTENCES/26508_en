ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin announced on Saturday (March 13th) that the government will submit a package of proposed constitutional amendments to parliament over the next seven to ten days. 
The amendments envision limiting the rights of judges, changes in the way judges and public prosecutors are chosen, and more rigorous procedures required to ban political parties. 
The government launched its initiative after the Constitutional Court nearly banned the ruling pro-Islamic Justice and Development Party last year, for allegedly trying to undermine Turkey's secular character.

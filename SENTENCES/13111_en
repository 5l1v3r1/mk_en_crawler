SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Monday (26 September) that the EU should treat Bulgaria the same way it treated the ten countries that joined the Union last year. 
He stressed efforts to adopt EU-required legislation to improve the judiciary and streamline the administration. 
His remarks came just weeks before the publication of the European Commission's progress report on Bulgaria and Romania, expected to be the decisive factor in whether the two countries join the Union in 2007 or 2008. 
Separately Monday, the European Parliament's special rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey van Orden, suggested that the EC report could be very critical.

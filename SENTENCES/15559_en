ZAGREB, Croatia -- Controversial businessman Hrvoje Petrac, once believed to be an aide to Croatian war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina, was extradited from Greece on Tuesday (22 August), nearly a year after he was arrested there. 
Petrac is wanted by Zagreb to serve a six-year prison sentence for kidnapping that was handed down in absentia. 
His transfer Tuesday involved a special flight aboard Croatian Airlines and tight security measures.

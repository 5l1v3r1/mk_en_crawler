SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament voted on Friday (15 July) to allow municipalities where ethnic Albanians are a majority to fly the Albanian flag together with the Macedonian one. 
This applies to 16 of the country's 84 municipalities. 
The adoption of the new law marks the complete implementation of the Ohrid Accord, which ended the 2001 conflict between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.
In other news, a bomb exploded near a police precinct in Skopje late Friday, causing minor damage but no casualties. 
This was the second attack on police in a week. 
It followed a machine gun and mortar assault Tuesday on a station north of Tetovo.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Elections in the Turkish-run part of Cyprus ended in a deadlock Sunday (14 December) with the pro-EU opposition getting 25 of parliament's 50 seats. 
With all of the votes counted early Monday morning, the Republican Turkish Party and the Peace and Democracy Movement together had 48 per cent. 
These two organisations back the UN plan for the reunification of the island. 
The National Unity Party and the Democrat Party had 46 per cent and also took 25 seats. 
The pro-EU opposition had only 11 seats in the previous parliament. 
A new election will have to be scheduled if none of the parties can form a ruling coalition. 
The Greek part of Cyprus will join the EU in 2004. 
The Union has warned Turkey that failure to resolve the Cyprus issue could affect Ankara's bid for membership, particularly in view of the presence of Turkish troops on the island.

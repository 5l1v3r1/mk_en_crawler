ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Wednesday (12 March), criticising an earlier statement by Jean-Christophe Filori, spokesman for the EU Commissioner for Enlargement.
Filori had blamed the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot sides for the failure of negotiations on the re-unification of Cyprus, saying the Greek part of Cyprus would become an EU member by May 2004 with or without the Turkish part of the island.
In response, the foreign ministry said the Union does not have the right to make unilateral decisions on the future of Cyprus.
It added that Filori's comments suggest a lack of information about Turkey's position on unification.

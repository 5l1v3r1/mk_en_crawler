BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Serbia on Friday (15 September) to ensure concrete results in its co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal by the end of this month. 
Addressing the meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Rehn said there has been no substantial evidence thus far of progress in implementing Belgrade's action plan for arresting fugitive war crimes suspects, the key to a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
An official statement issued by the EU Council also urged action by the Serbian government, saying the Union attaches great importance to the integration of Serbia in the family of European nations. 
The newspaper Danas is reporting that Rehn and chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte will meet later this month to review Belgrade's progress.

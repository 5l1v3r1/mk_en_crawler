WASHINGTON, United States -- Lawyers representing Armenian-Americans filed a class-action federal lawsuit on Thursday (July 29th) against the Turkish government. 
It seeks compensation for land, buildings and businesses allegedly seized when many Armenians were driven forcibly from the Ottoman Empire a century ago. 
The suit, alleging breach of statutory trust, unjust enrichment, human-rights violation and violations of international law, was filed on behalf of Darbis Davouyan from Los Angeles and Hrayr Turabian from New York. 
It is the first such lawsuit to name the Turkish government as a defendant directly.

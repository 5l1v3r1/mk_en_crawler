TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Tuesday (21 December) passed the state budget for 2005. 
Defending the budget before lawmakers, Prime Minister Fatos Nano said it guaranteed economic development and reforms. 
The opposition, however, argued that it would widen the gap between the poor and rich.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic was scheduled to begin a groundbreaking visit to Albania late Wednesday. 
It is the first trip by a Belgrade foreign minister to Tirana since the two countries restored diplomatic relations in 2001.

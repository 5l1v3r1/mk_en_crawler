ANKARA, Turkey -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday (23 February) that Turkey is "on the right path" in its efforts to meet the standards for EU membership.
He urged the government to persevere with reforms, and said that accession talks must begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria.
"The EU must stand by its previous word," Schroeder said, adding this could happen by year's end.
Schroeder, the first German head of state to visit Ankara in 11 years, also praised Turkey for its role in restarting talks on the reunification of Cyprus.
In other news Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul arrived in Moscow on a four-day official visit.
The focus of his meetings will be co-operation in the global fight against terrorism and efforts to consolidate bilateral business ties.

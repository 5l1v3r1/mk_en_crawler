NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The trial against four former airline officials charged in connection with a deadly air crash began in Nicosia on Thursday (September 17th). 
The four defendants, who were working at the now defunct Helios Airways company at the time, pleaded not guilty to 119 counts of manslaughter and causing deaths by recklessness. 
If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
A total of 121 people were killed when Helios Flight 522 went down near Marathon, Greece in August 2005. 
A Greek commission investigating the crash concluded that the plane's crew, all of whom died, were directly responsible for the tragedy. 
Indirectly, however, the Cypriot Civil Aviation department was blamed for recklessness in the technical inspection of the plane and other omissions. 
The trial was adjourned until November 27th to give defence lawyers more time to prepare.

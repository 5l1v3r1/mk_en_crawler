BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) late Friday (November 19th) stripped former Kosovo Bishop Artemije of his title after he occupied a monastery in the former Serb province and performed a service in defiance of the church's orders. 
The church sent Artemije into retirement in February, following speculation about his questionable business dealings, and banned him from holding any services. 
He disputed this decision and asked the church's assembly to review his case. 
The review upheld the SPC's decision earlier this week.
Together with several monks, however, Artemije on Friday entered the Zubin Potok monastery in northern Kosovo and performed a liturgy. 
The SPC reacted immediately by stripping him of his rank and degrading him to the status of a monk. 
Furthermore, the SPC said criminal charges would be pressed against Artemije for "usurping" the church's properties.

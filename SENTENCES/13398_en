SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During visits to Srebrenica and Potocari, outgoing High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown again called on Wednesday (25 January) for the arrest of war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
He said construction of the Potocari burial centre for victims of the July 1995 massacre was a source of satisfaction during his four-year mandate, adding that it was shameful that the alleged architects of the massacre were still at large.
His mandate expires on 31 January.

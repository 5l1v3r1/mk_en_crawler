VLORA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu reiterated on Friday (November 3rd) his hope that the main parties could agree on a date of the next local elections. 
If not, Moisiu said, he is ready to set the date himself. 
By law, the next municipal elections must take place between December 20th and January 20th. 
The opposition, led by the Socialist Party, says heavy winter weather could affect turnout.

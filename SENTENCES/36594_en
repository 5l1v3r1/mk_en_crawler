TIRANA, Albania -- The two main political parties must co-operate with smaller parties on the issue of electoral reform, says Doris Pack, president of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Southeast Europe.
In an interview with the Shekulli daily on Monday (2 August), Pack was asked to comment on Albania's progress towards EU integration, and particularly on government efforts.
She agreed with Albanian Minister of Integration Ermelinda Meksi, who said tension within the ruling party is hampering the entire government.
Pack also urged authorities to take more decisive steps in the fight against corruption and human trafficking.

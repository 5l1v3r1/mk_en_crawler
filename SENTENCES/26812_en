ATHENS, Greece -- Some 4,500 members of the centre-right New Democracy Party (ND) gathered at an extraordinary congress in Athens on Saturday (November 7th).
They adopted changes to the party's statute which would allow all regular members to vote in the process of electing a new ND leader.
Voting for the new leader will be held on November 29th.
Three candidates -- former foreign ministers Dora Bakoyannis and Antonis Samaras and Thessaloniki prefect Panagiotis Psomiadis -- are in the running to replace former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who stepped down from the party leadership after ND lost the October 4th snap general elections.
Former Health Minister and Athens mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos was also among the candidates, but withdrew his nomination at the last minute, saying he does not want to be part of an internal fight within the party.

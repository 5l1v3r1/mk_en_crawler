SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU ambassadors meeting in Sarajevo denounced on Saturday (February 23rd) the Bosnian Serbs position that they have the right to follow Kosovo's example and declare independence. 
The statement referred to a resolution adopted by the Republika Srpska (RS) parliament on Friday, which said that if most EU countries and the United States recognise Kosovo's independence, then RS would also have the right to secede from BiH. 
The EU diplomats -- headed by EU presidency holder, Slovenia -- said the two entities in the country "have no right to secede" under the Dayton Peace Accord.
In a separate story, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik proposed on Friday that BiH should be completely demilitarised. 
"The existence of armed forces only serves to send troops abroad. 
Additionally, the military expenses in the budget of BiH amount to more than 300m euros annually, which could be used for social programmes and R and D purposes," Dodik said. 
"NATO can guarantee BiH's stability in the long run," he added.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski wrote to French counterpart Jacques Chirac on Wednesday (14 December), seeking full support for Macedonia's bid to receive EU candidate status.
EU state and government leaders are meeting in Brussels to consider Macedonia's application, which already has been recommended by the European Commission.
While acknowledging budgetary problems within the EU, Crvenkovski stressed that granting candidate status to his country would be a "victory" for Europe.

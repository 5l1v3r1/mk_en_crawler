BUCHAREST, Romania -- The conflict between President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu worsened on Sunday (March 11th) when the two politicians exchanged angry letters over a government meeting scheduled for Monday. 
Tariceanu sent a letter to the president telling him that he was not welcome at the cabinet session to decide the date of elections for European Parliament. 
Basescu responded by saying it is his duty to be there. 
The constitution allows the president to preside over cabinet meetings when matters of defence, public order, and foreign policy are discussed. 
Basescu is trying to prevent Tariceanu from postponing the election, planned for May 13th.

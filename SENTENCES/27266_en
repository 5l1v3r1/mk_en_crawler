SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Twelve opposition parties led by the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia formed a bloc Monday (February 1st) aimed at changing the balance of power. 
The parties blame the ruling VMRO-DPMNE -- led by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski -- for the economic and political troubles. 
The bloc includes no ethnic Albanian parties. 
It is planning proposals to promote the country's strategic interests, fight crime and corruption and boost democracy.

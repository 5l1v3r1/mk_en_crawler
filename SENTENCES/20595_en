BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police reported on Thursday (August 9th) the arrest of a 25-year-old man allegedly found with more than half a million euros and US dollars in forged banknotes. 
Officials say they don't know how many of the forged bills are in circulation. 
The currency was printed in Germany on paper originally used to print Yugoslav dinars in the early 1990s.

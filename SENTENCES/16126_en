TIRANA, Albania -- The four-month mandate of the parliamentary commission on electoral reform ended on Tuesday (November 14th) without the ruling parties and the opposition reaching a compromise. 
The two sides cannot agree on the timing of the next local elections. 
The majority wants them in the winter, as spelled out in the Constitution, while opposition wants to postpone them until spring. 
A frustrated President Alfred Moisiu has said that if no consensus is reached, he will set the election date himself.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov has thrown his support behind Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin, who recently warned that Bulgaria could withdraw support for neighbouring Macedonia's EU bid if it does not "strictly observe principles of good neighborly relations". 
In an interview with the Sofia news agency Focus on Saturday (29 July), Parvanov said Kalfin was right to call for tolerance by both sides, and that bilateral ties must be based on "a sensible reading of history".
The two countries are at odds over a self-proclaimed ethnic Macedonian party in Bulgaria, OMO Ilinden-Pirin. 
Macedonia has been pushing for Bulgarian authorities to register the party, which Sofia says has a separatist platform.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Director of the EU Integration Office Milica Delevic told the Belgrade-based daily Blic Sunday (August 9th) that the government will submit Serbia's EU membership application by the end of 2009.
She added that Belgrade should guarantee the support of its partners in the bloc in order to accelerate its EU integration process.
Delevic refused to predict when the Stabilisation and Association Agreement -- already signed with Brussels -- will be unblocked, but stressed the importance of Serbia's full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
The Netherlands insists fugitive Ratko Mladic be arrested before implementing the agreement.

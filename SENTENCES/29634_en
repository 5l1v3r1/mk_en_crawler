ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors in Istanbul questioned nine senior Turkish military officials Friday (May 27th) as part of an ongoing investigation into the so-called Sledgehammer plot to topple the government.
The prosecutors will decide whether to bring the suspects to court, which could either order their arrest or release them.
The Sledgehammer operation allegedly aimed to create an atmosphere of chaos in Turkey that was supposed to ultimately allow the military to stage a coup d'Ã©tat.
About 200 former and active army members have been charged in relation to the alleged plot and most of them have been sent to prison.

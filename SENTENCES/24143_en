BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Wednesday (July 15th) plans for Serbia and EULEX to sign an accord on Kosovo border control soon. 
He said a draft agreement was reached during EU security chief Javier Solana's visit to Belgrade earlier this week. 
Dacic stressed that efficient control of the Kosovo border is fundamental for efforts to fight organised crime and weapons smuggling, and as such, must be free of politics. 
The European Commission says the EU Council is likely to lift EU visa requirements for Serbs this autumn, but only if they implement remaining reforms under the visa liberalisation roadmap, including providing reliable surveillance of the border with Kosovo.

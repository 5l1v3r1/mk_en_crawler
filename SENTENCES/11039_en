SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The wartime commander of the Bosnian Muslim army travelled to The Hague on Monday (28 February) to surrender to the UN tribunal.
Rasim Delic faces charges in connection with war crimes committed by foreign Islamic fighters under his command.
He announced his decision to surrender last week after being served with the UN indictment.
Another major figure, former Bosnian Serb Army General Radivoje Miletic, was also due to travel to The Hague on Monday to answer charges related to atrocities Serb forces committed in Srebrenica and Zepa in 1995.

BERLIN, Germany -- Croatian President Ivo Josipovic arrived on Wednesday (January 19th) for a three-day visit to Germany where he meets on Thursday with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulff.
Security is tight after Croatia's Embassy in Berlin received a parcel containing a hand grenade.
An accompanying letter threatened Josipovic over his efforts to improve ties with Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government reportedly is working to draft a series of amendments to reduce the number of illegal weapons in the country.
Authorities estimate there are 1.5m of them in circulation.
All residents would be given a chance to register undeclared weapons by the end of this year.
The changes will bring legislation into line with EU guidelines.

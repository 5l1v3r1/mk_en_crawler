BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE Solomon Passy urged the EU to increase support for infrastructure projects in the Balkans, according to a statement issued Tuesday (24 February). 
Passy, who is Bulgaria's foreign minister, appealed to the Union to consider its aid to the region not only from a business point of view but also politically. 
He noted that while some projects do not meet business criteria, they are significant to maintaining political stability and regional integration.

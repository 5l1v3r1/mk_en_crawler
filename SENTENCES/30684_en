SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov on Wednesday (April 6th) reinstated Krassimir Parvanov, director of the national electricity company NEK, after he was sacked by Energy Minister Traycho Traykov over a deal Parvanov signed with Russia's Rosatom subsidiary Atomstroyexport, the contractor selected for the Belene nuclear power.
Traykov had said the memorandum of understanding was "unfavourable to Bulgaria".
"Minister Traykov made a mistake and has been warned," Borisov told reporters in Sofia.
Parvanov has denied any wrongdoing.

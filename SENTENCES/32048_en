BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb authorities have asked Interpol to help them track down foreign bank accounts of Orao Aviation Institute, the defence contractor recently accused of violating the UN embargo against Iraq.
Interior Minister Dragomir Jovicic announced Wednesday (20 November) that investigators want more information on transactions involving accounts in Yugoslavia, the United States and Hong Kong.
He added that no contracts with Iraq were found in the company's offices, indicating intermediaries were used in all deals to upgrade the Iraqi air force.
Three Orao executives are in custody in connection with the case.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian authorities destroyed some 347,456 copies of illegally produced music, films, games and software in an unprecedented public action aimed at rooting out compact disc piracy. 
The discs were taken to a local factory in Belgrade for recycling, Beta news agency said Thursday (23 March), quoting Trade Minister Bojan Dimitrijevic. 
Serbia has been threatened with punitive measures by the International Agency for the Protection of Intellectual Property, the biggest world organisation for copyright protection. 
CD piracy is regarded as a major source of funds for organised crime networks throughout Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will visit Bulgaria later this week to discuss the possibility of direct Alliance involvement in Iraq and a new UN Security Council resolution on Iraq.
This will be Scheffer's first visit to Bulgaria since he assumed his post and since Bulgaria became a full-fledged member of the Alliance.
In other news, Bulgarian Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov returned from Berlin on Monday saying the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company had offered Sofia 16 military and 12 transportation helicopters that meet NATO standards.
The suggested price is equal to the $150m in financing approved by Sofia to modernise the country's old MI-17 and MI-24 helicopters.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministry confirms that two Bulgarian doctors working in Libya now face charges.
One is accused of malpractice in the death of an elderly patient;
the other is a surgeon who has been barred from leaving Libya.
The new problems come on the heels of death sentences handed down to five Bulgarian medics in Libya last week.

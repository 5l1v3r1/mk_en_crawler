PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Slobodan Petrovic, leader of Kosovo Serb Independent Liberal Party (SLS), said on Tuesday (December 28th) that his party is ready to form a coalition with Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).
The SLS expects to get at least nine seats in parliament following the December 12th snap elections and be part of the new government.

The final results of the elections will be announced after January 9th re-votes in several municipalities.

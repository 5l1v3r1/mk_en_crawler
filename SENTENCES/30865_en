SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko on Thursday (May 5th) gave the leadership of Republika Srpska's (RS) seven days to annul their referendum decision.
Inzko said that he will travel to New York on Monday, to speak before the UN Security Council, adding that if RS fails to give up the referendum plan by the time he returns, he will use his Bonn powers to annul the referendum.
Reportedly backing him on this is the Peace Implementation Council (PIC).
Ambassadors of the participating countries met with him in Sarajevo on Thursday.
RS wants to hold a referendum in early June to ask its citizens whether they approve of the high representative's imposed decisions, particularly those referring to the establishment of the BiH state court and prosecution.
RS claims the court has been extremely biased against Serb indictees.

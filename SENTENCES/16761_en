SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU will monitor closely the 5 July parliamentary elections in Macedonia, Pierre Mirel, director of European Commission's Enlargement Directorate General, told EU Integration Minister Radmila Sekerinska on Tuesday (6 June).
Mirel stressed that the elections will be an important test, providing the country the opportunity to prove its political and democratic maturity.
Noting progress Macedonia has made in implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, he and Sekerinska also discussed the remaining priorities, specifically judicial and police reform.

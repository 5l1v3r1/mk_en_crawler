ANKARA, Turkey - Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sent a letter to the heads of governments of EU member states to urge them to "take tangible steps against the [terrorist] Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)", media reported on Friday (November 14th).
"It isn't sufficient to insert the PKK on a list of terrorist organisations, but it is necessary to take efficient actions against it," said Erdogan in the letter.
He says leaders of the Kurdish separatist movement can move freely throughout European territory and that EU member governments continue to ignore Ankara's extradition requests.

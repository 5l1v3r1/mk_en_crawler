BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A former minister and ten officials and business executives have been arrested on charges of embezzlement and financial misconduct, Serbian police announced Tuesday (23 November). 
Investigators say that Marija Raseta Vukosavljevic, who served as Serbian transport minister from 2000 to 2003, was involved in a scheme that defrauded the country of 2.94m euros in the course of building a new terminal at Belgrade Airport. 
A former airport manager, his deputy and two contractors are among those arrested in the case.

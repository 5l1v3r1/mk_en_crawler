BUCHAREST, Romania -- The major trade unions in the public sector seem poised to hold a general strike at the end of the month, after the latest round of talks with the government failed on Thursday (May 20th).
Unions are lobbying against plans to slash salaries in the sector by 25%, but government officials are sticking to their position.
As a result, odds are that the strike will include railways and schools, along with other sectors that have significant dealings with the state.
The situation has grown more strained, in that the head of the IMF Mission to Romania, Jeffrey Franks, has suggested that the Fund could be flexible, if the government wants to consider a new mix of measures to reach fiscal targets.

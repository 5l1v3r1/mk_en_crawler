Hrant Dink, a prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist who spoke out against the killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire, was shot and killed Friday (January 19th) according to press sources. 
Reportedly, Dink was leaving Agos -- an Istanbul-based Armenian language newspaper of which he is editor -- when he was shot four times by a teenager. 
Described as a "well-known commentator on Armenian affairs", Dink was convicted last year on charges of "insulting Turkishness", after he wrote on the banned topic of the genocide of Armenians under Ottoman rule during the early 20th century. 
His sentencing in the case was postponed. 
Police are currently investigating the shooting.

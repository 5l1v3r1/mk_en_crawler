BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Secession calls in Republika Srpska (RS) intensified on Monday (February 18th) after Kosovo proclaimed independence. 
Veterans' association SPONA director Branislav Dukic asked the RS parliament to declare the "self-determination" of the region. 
The main opposition Serb Democratic Party (SDS) also called on RS institutions to provide Bosnian Serbs with the same rights now being afforded Kosovar Albanians. 
The SDS insists a referendum on RS's future would be the best way to comply with the will of the public.
Meanwhile, angry students protested in downtown Banja Luka on Monday, throwing stones at the building that jointly hosts the French and German diplomatic missions. 
The demonstrators insisted that Kosovo remain part of Serbia.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik -- who in the past has frequently threatened a secession referendum -- said it would be difficult to explain to people "why the Kosovo principle cannot apply" to RS. 
But he says he will resort to legal means, pushing for the right of self-determination to be incorporated in the new BiH Constitution.

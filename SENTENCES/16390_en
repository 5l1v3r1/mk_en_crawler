BAD BRUECKENAU, Germany -- The Croatian national team is hoping for a draw in its World Cup opening match against Brazil on Tuesday (13 June). 
Manager Zlatko Kranjcar said it would not be "such a big surprise" if his team beat the much feared Brazilians. 
His son Niko scored Croatia's goal for a 1-1 draw with Brazil in Split last year. 
He has been named to Tuesday's starting lineup.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro coach Ilija Petkovic refused to comment on his tactics in Sunday's defeat to the Netherlands. 
He was roasted by journalists and some of his own players for adopting a defensive plan that gave the fast Dutch plenty of room for manoeuvering. 
Winger Ognjen Koroman, who entered as a substitute, said he was "baffled" by his coach's tactics.

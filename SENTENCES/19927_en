NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The dispute between Damascus and Nicosia about a new sea route between Syria and Northern Cyprus may be settled soon, Cypriot and Greek media reported on Monday (October 22nd).
The honorary president of the Greek Cypriot Movement of Social Democrats, Vasos Lyssarides visited Damascus on Saturday at the request of Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos.
Lyssarides says Syrian President Bashar al-Assad assured him that a mutually acceptable solution would be found soon.
The dispute began a month ago when Turkish Northern Cyprus opened a sea route to Syria, first only as a cruise, then a regular route.
It became the first sea connection between Northern Cyprus and a country outside of Turkey.

SALZBURG, Austria -- Visiting Salzburg on Sunday (August 29th), Romanian Interior Minister Vasil Blaga observed that none of the Roma repatriated from France recently has criminal records in Romania or France. 
He explained that authorities have carefully looked into the history of the repatriated individuals and have not found evidence of crimes in either of the two countries. 
However, he noted, if there is evidence that any Romanian citizen resides in France illegally, he or she can be deported. 
Blaga was in Salzburg attending a conference of Eastern European interior ministers. 
Several hundred Roma have been returned to Bulgaria and Romania as part of France's new strategy to deport them due to security concerns.

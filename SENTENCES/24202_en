ZAGREB, Croatia -- Unions representing public sector employees struck a deal with the government early Thursday (May 14th) regarding salary hikes, which ended the ongoing strike and averted a massive demonstration scheduled for Saturday.
Within the next month, all relevant unions will hold a referendum on the agreement.
Negotiators will sign the pact if the majority of union members approve it.
Under the agreement, starting in January, salaries of public servants will be harmonised with inflation.
A 6% wage hike, abolished as of April 1st, will return if the GDP registers a 2% increase in two consecutive quarters.
Education workers walked out first Wednesday.
An estimated 80% of Croatia's teachers and professors took part in the protest.

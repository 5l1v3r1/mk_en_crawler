ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croats are voting on Sunday (November 25th) for a new parliament. 
Polls predict a close race between Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) of Zoran Milanovic. 
The Croatian constitution stipulates that the parliament have no less than 100 and no more than 160 deputies. 
Minorities will elect eight people to represent them in the future parliament.
Many experts believe the election could hinge on the 400,000 Croatian expatriates -- most of whom live in Bosnia and Herzegovina -- who began casting their ballots on Saturday in 265 polling stations in 53 countries.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul charged eight more suspects Friday (April 17th) as part of the controversial Ergenekon probe. 
The suspects include Mehmet Haberal, rector and owner of Ankara's Baskent University, and three other former university rectors. 
Police detained them in the latest wave of arrests related to the shadowy secularist Ergenekon group, which allegedly planned bombings and assassinations of high-profile public figures to incite chaos and overthrow the ruling Justice and Development Party's government.
Meanwhile, police detained more than 40 people for alleged links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in simultaneous operations in four provinces early Friday. 
Authorities detained 21 people in the western province of Izmir, eight in Ankara, and 15 in the southeastern province of Batman.

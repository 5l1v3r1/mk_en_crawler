PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An explosion at the International Civilian Office's (ICO) headquarters in Pristina on Friday (November 14th) was caused by a bomb thrown by an unknown assailant.
The explosion broke windows but injured nobody, police spokesman Veton Elshani said.
EU special representative to Kosovo Pieter Feith said he and the ICO would continue "working for the benefit of the people of Kosovo and for stability in the region".
Asked if there could be a link between the explosion and a recent deal between Serbia and the EU on the deployment of the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo, President Fatmir Sejdiu said "We would not want to link these two things.
But the enemies of Kosovo could try everything to create such a link." US Ambassador to Kosovo Tina Kaidanow condemned the act and called on all participants in the political negotiations in Kosovo "to be careful about the rhetoric they use".
Authorities said they still have no suspects and have not identified the device or the attacker's motive.
In other news, the Vatican will not recognise Kosovo, the State Secretariat of the Holy See said on Friday.
"We believe that the issue is still open, as it is being discussed by the UN," the Roman Catholic Church said.
The statement repudiated reports by Kosovo newspapers stating that a Vatican representative had informed Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni the Holy See would consider recognising the country's independence.

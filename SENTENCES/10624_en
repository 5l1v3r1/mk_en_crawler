SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ODIHR announced on Tuesday (12 October) that deployment of its observation mission for the 7 November referendum on Macedonia's decentralisation laws is under way. 
The mission is headed by Austrian diplomat Friedrich Bauer and will include over 220 monitors.
Russian Ambassador to Skopje Agaton Asatur has joined other international diplomats in expressing concern over the consequences of the referendum. 
In an interview with Utrinski Vesnik published Wednesday, Asatur warned that the poll could represent a setback for the country, as decentralisation is part of the Ohrid Accords.

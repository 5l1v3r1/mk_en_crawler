BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica insisted on Tuesday (4 May) that there were no negotiations between the government and Milorad "Legija" Lukovic, the accused mastermind of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination, prior to his surrender Sunday.
"The Serbian government did not encourage Lukovic to surrender, he surrendered himself," said Kostunica, adding the surrender took authorities by surprise.
The media has speculated that the government offered Legija protected witness status in exchange for testimony that would be damaging to Djindjic's Democratic Party.
In other news, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) is calling on Serbian authorities to enhance media freedom.
At a conference in Belgrade on Tuesday, UNESCO Director-General Koichiro Matsuura urged the country to ensure proper conditions for an independent and competitive media.

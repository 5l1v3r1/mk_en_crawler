TIRANA, Albania -- Oil entrepreneur Rezart Taci reported to a police station in Tirana on Thursday (November 5th), days after he was accused of beating journalist and publisher Mero Baze at a Tirana bar earlier this week.
Taci played down accusations against him, saying he is ready to face justice.
Media have speculated that Baze was beaten by Taci and his two bodyguards for publishing articles accusing Taci of corruption.
The assault sparked strong reactions from domestic and international journalist associations, government officials and opposition parties, as well as foreign embassies.

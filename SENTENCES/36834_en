TIRANA, Albania -- At least ten minor parliamentary forces have banded together to block the efforts of a parliamentary commission tasked with making changes to the electoral code. 
The parties convened at a roundtable on Monday (12 July) in Tirana and agreed not to participate in the commission. 
The panel was formed after the ruling Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party signed an agreement supported by the OSCE Presence in Albania. 
The minor parties insist the major parties are taking advantage of them, and are asking international organisations to help implement election changes, rather than the commission.

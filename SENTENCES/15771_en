BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Tuesday (20 June) again urged Turkey to observe its commitments in the EU accession process. 
He said domestic authorities must take immediate measures to overcome the delays -- especially those involving human and religious rights, setting up an ombudsman institution, clarifying the role of the military, and fighting corruption.
Rehn also called on Turkey to honour an extended customs protocol that requires it to open its ports and airspace to Greek Cypriot ships and planes. 
"If we want to avoid a major problem in the autumn, Turkey needs to stick to its word," he said.

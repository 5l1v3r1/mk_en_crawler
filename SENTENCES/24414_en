PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police have arrested three people with suspected ties to organised crime, local media reported on Friday (June 12th). 
Two are members of the Security Intelligence Agency of Serbia (BIA), according to media sources. 
"The case has been under investigation for a long time now. 
They are suspected of being involved in burning the border points in northern Kosovo and of other criminal activities in this area," police sources were quoted as saying. 
Reportedly, all three suspects are Serbs. 
Border crossings 1 and 31 were torched days after Kosovo declared independence in February 2008.

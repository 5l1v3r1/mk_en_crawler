LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Parliament's EU affairs committee supported on Tuesday (February 16th) the opening of two more negotiation chapters -- one on the environment and one on fisheries.
The move came during Croatia's EU accession conference, set for Friday.
Lawmakers from the ruling coalition gave their approval after Prime Minister Borut Pahor assured them that Slovenia's national interests in those areas will be protected.
Until recently, a maritime border dispute between neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia had slowed Zagreb's accession bid.

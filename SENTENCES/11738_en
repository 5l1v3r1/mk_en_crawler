BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic said after a meeting with the entity's top political leaders on Monday (20 December) that Republika Srpska (RS) authorities would seek a "constructive" way out of the impasse resulting from the resignations of Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic and the possible departure of the ministers of transportation and justice. 
He sought to dispel media speculation that the RS leadership plans a showdown with High Representative Paddy Ashdown, who has sacked nine Bosnian Serb officials for obstructing the search for war crimes indictees.
In other news, former Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and his finance minister, Novak Kondic, were charged on Monday with financial misconduct. 
The two are accused of ordering payments of more than $4m between1998 and 2000, without authorisation from the government.

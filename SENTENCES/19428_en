PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament decided on Tuesday (September 25th) to postpone discussion of the new draft constitution from October 1st to October 15th. 
The extra two weeks would provide more time for the ruling coalition and the opposition to strike a compromise. 
If an agreement is reached, the constitution will be approved by the parliament. 
Otherwise, it will be voted on in a referendum. 
Discussions on the new constitution began a year ago, a few months after the republic declared its independence.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Germany may cut its aid to Kosovo following the arrest last month of three agents with the German Federal Intelligence Agency (BND), media reported on Sunday (November 30th). 
Police arrested the trio in Kosovo after an explosion at the International Civilian Office in Pristina on November 14th. 
They were released two weeks later after an international court found no evidence of their involvement in the blast. 
According to the German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag, Berlin is mulling whether to reduce its substantial aid to the young country. 
Germany is second only to the United States in terms of donations.

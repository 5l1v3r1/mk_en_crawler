BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Union of Public Servants threatened on Tuesday (January 27th) to organise protests in the second half of February unless the government gives public servants a 50% pay hike. 
The union says a law mandates the increase.
Also Tuesday, President Traian Basescu backed a proposal to freeze wages and pensions for six months to ease budgetary problems. 
The president told a local TV station he would not object if the cabinet decides to freeze wages and pensions before the autumn presidential elections. 
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party confirmed it has been discussing the idea.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Republican People's Party filed a motion Tuesday (21 September) to hold an extraordinary session of parliament on 28 September. 
The goal would be to complete the adoption of the country's new penal code by 1 October. 
The EU has signalled that it would not open accession talks with Ankara until the new law is passed. 
Last week, the ruling Justice and Development Party withdrew the bill, in an apparent bid to include a controversial provision criminalising adultery. 
In an interview published Tuesday in the French newspaper <I>Le Monde</I>, incoming European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned Turkey not to delay key legal reforms.

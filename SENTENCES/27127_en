BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (December 2nd) signed into a law a measure that extends the authority of the lame duck cabinet.
It allows the government to oversee the adoption of the 2010 budget, along with other important legislation, required by the IMF and the EU for continued financial assistance.
The amendment lets an outgoing government propose legislation required under international agreements, as well as under extraordinary circumstances, the latter to be decided by parliament.
Until now, a cabinet in the current situation -- ousted by a vote of confidence -- had largely caretaker authority only.

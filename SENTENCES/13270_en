PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Miroslav Lajcak, EU special envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum, said on Tuesday (21 February) that the EU proposal regarding the poll's validity margin is unlikely to change.
The EU has suggested that 55 per cent of participating voters must back independence in order for it to succeed.
Earlier in the day, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic urged the EU to reconsider its recommendation.

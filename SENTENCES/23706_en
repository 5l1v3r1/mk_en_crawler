SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A court in BiH on Tuesday (June 23rd) turned down Croatia's request for the extradition of Croatian politician Branimir Glavas. 
Judges concluded that Glavas can not be transferred to Croatia because he holds Bosnian citizenship. 
Glavas fled to BiH in May after a Croatian court sentenced him to ten years in prison for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s. 
He was briefly detained by Bosnian police on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia.

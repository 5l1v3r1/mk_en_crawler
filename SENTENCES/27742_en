SOFIA, Bulgaria -- More than 700 people took part in a Gay Pride parade in Sofia on Saturday (June 26th) amid heavy police presence. 
Three people were detained. 
Participants in the third Gay Pride parade called for more tolerance of homosexuals. 
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church condemned the event, calling it "a shameful demonstration". 
The march was supported by range of human rights organisations and foreign missions. 
Earlier in the day, dozens of nationalists staged an anti-gay protest but no incidents were reported.

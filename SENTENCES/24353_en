TIRANA, Albania -- A prosecutor charged ethnic Greek Vasil Bollano, mayor of the southern town of Himara, with abuse of power Tuesday (March 10th), according to media reports.
Bollano allegedly ordered the removal of road signs in Himara in December 2007, arguing the signs should bear Greek text as well.
According to the prosecutor's office, Bollano caused damage worth nearly 170,000 euros.
Earlier, the mayor declared that the Himara region was Greek territory.

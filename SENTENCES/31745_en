ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis warned Turkey on Monday (7 April) that it would not be able to join the EU until the reunification of Cyprus. 
"The line dividing Nicosia also separates Turkey from the European Union," he said in a televised speech. 
Greece now holds the rotating EU presidency. 
Simitis also rejected a Turkish Cypriot proposal to start bilateral talks between the two sides of the divided island, insisting that a solution must be sought with the participation of the UN and the EU. 
He is to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday. 
The EU has decided to admit only the Greek Cypriot part of the island as a member. 
The accession agreement is to be signed next week.
Meanwhile, Hansjorg Kretschmer, the European Commission Representative to Turkey, said from Istanbul on Monday that before launching negotiations for full Union membership, Turkey must meet all political criteria. 
He described that as a matter of preference, rather than one of capabilities or time.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Representatives of Kosovo's interim government insisted on Monday (17 October) that the province's potential independence would not jeopardise the territorial integrity of neighbouring Macedonia. 
According to Avni Arifi, political adviser to Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, the provisional institutions are dismissing as groundless any fears that Macedonia's sovereignty would be threatened by Kosovo independence. 
On Sunday, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski had said his country wanted firm guarantees from Kosovo before the final status of the province is determined.

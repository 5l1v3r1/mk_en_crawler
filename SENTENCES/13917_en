BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu vowed on Wednesday (16 November) that Romania would provide the assistance needed to resolve the looming electricity supply problem in neighbouring Moldova.
Vasile Tarlev, the Moldavan prime minister, paid an emergency visit to Bucharest seeking support after the Russian power utility RAO UES shut down its power plant in Moldova -- the only electricity producer in the country -- claiming it was not profitable.

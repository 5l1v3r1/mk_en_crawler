SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court for War Crimes of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo found Bosnian Serb Radisav Ljubinac guilty of persecution and forcible deportation of Muslim civilians in villages near Rogatica in November 1992 and sentenced him to ten years in prison on Thursday (March 8th). 
The court reviewed 195 pieces of evidence and heard 29 witnesses during the trial.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Democratic Party (DS), a leading partner in the ruling coalition, is considering a cabinet reshuffle, the newspaper Politika reported Thursday (February 4th).
DS spokeswoman Jelena Trivan said that although there is no reason for early general elections -- as the opposition wants -- the cabinet should be streamlined.
The other major coalition partner, the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS), seemingly agrees.
The third party in the coalition, G17 Plus, also wants to avoid early general elections.

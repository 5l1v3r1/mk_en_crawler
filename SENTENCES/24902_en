BELGRADE, Serbia -- A former mayor of Zrenjanin and leader of President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) has been charged with corruption, along with 21 other people, the special organised crime prosecution service announced on Wednesday (April 1st).
Goran Knezevic and the others are suspected of causing 1.6m euros in financial losses to the municipality via a crime ring that accepted and offered bribes.
Knezevic, 51, was arrested in October as part of a wide-scale police operation against a group suspected of abuse of office in deals involving building lots and public procurements.
The crimes allegedly were committed between 2006 and 2008.

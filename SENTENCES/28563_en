TIRANA, Albania -- Immigrants living in Greece and Italy will soon be able to apply for biometric passports in consular offices in the two countries. 
Parliament's Commission for Laws signed a contract Tuesday (September 14th) with Sagem Securite, the company in charge of producing the passports, which enables the launch of procedures. 
Offices will open in Athens, Thessaloniki, Rome and Milano. 
Crowds of immigrants visiting Albania during the summer has caused long queues in civil registration offices. 
Albania expects to benefit from visa liberalisation with EU countries by the end of the year.

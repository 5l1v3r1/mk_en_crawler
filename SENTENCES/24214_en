TIRANA, Albania -- The government will deliver a progress report to the EU Council of Ministers on Wednesday (January 14th) to help the country move towards visa liberalisation. 
Albania has met the requirements and has shown progress, according to the government. 
However, the opposition is sceptical, arguing that the process will likely fail. 
Former Foreign Minister Arta Dade of the opposition Socialist Party says the government is behind in meeting key requirements, such as issuing new ID cards, managing the border and combating crime.
In other news, Italian police head Antonio Manganelli visited Tirana on Tuesday and predicted Albania will become the centre of all European police services that combat organised crime in the Balkans. 
According to Manganelli, a joint regional task force would be more effective in combating crime and illegal trafficking, particularly drug trafficking.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Former European Parliament (EP) President Pat Cox says political uncertainties in Turkey need quick resolution to prevent instability.
Speaking at a forum in Istanbul on Thursday (April 24th), Cox said there is early evidence of a potential slippage in international business confidence in Turkey, following court action aimed at closing down the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
At the same event, another MEP, Vural Oger, said prospects of EU membership will effectively end if the country's Constitutional Court bans the AKP.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement commemorated on Thursday (February 10th) two of its activists killed four years ago by UNMIK police during a protest.
Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti was convicted of organising the demonstration, but no charges were filed against two Romanians who were the alleged aggressors.
EULEX says its involvement in this case has ended and any further queries should be addressed to the UN or to Romanian authorities.

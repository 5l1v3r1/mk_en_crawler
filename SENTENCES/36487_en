SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The World Bank announced Tuesday (11 May) that it has cancelled a $12m loan earmarked to speed up the reform of BiH's system of higher education. 
Dirk Reinermann, the Bank's chief officer in Sarajevo, told reporters that the entire project was cancelled because the BiH Parliament failed to pass a new law on higher education by 7 May. 
Negotiations have been going on for five years. 
The Bank is urging authorities to fulfil other requirements to receive funds designated to support social reforms. 
Reinermann said the Bank has not yet decided whether to provide a $34m structural adjustment loan.

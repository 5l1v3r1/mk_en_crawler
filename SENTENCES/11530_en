SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) on Friday (21 January) urged all members of the BiH Council of Ministers to attend cabinet sessions, saying that non-participation obstructs the function of state institutions.
It also warned that the problem is blocking implementation of key requirements related to the country's Euro-Atlantic integration.
The OHR statement came as BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic publicly admitted that the absence of Serb ministers is causing problems.
Terzic said that if none of the four Serb ministers attended the next cabinet session scheduled for 1 February, it would mean a government crisis.
They resigned last month after international sanctions were imposed on Republika Srpska (RS).
Meanwhile, RS Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic says he will hold talks with Bosniak and Croat parties this week, seeking wider parliamentary support for the future entity cabinet.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Ombudsperson Institution published a report Wednesday (April 1st) that blames UNMIK for rights violations the Roma have suffered in camps in northern Mitrovica since 1999.
The report concludes that UNMIK has continuously violated international standards for human rights and it urges the government to intervene by building shelters for the Roma, to prevent their exposure to dangerous toxins and lead.
The area in northern Mitrovica was contaminated by a lead processing plant.

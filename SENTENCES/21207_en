TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Saturday (September 29th) that a unilateral proclamation of independence by Kosovo Albanians -- without approval by the international community -- would be unproductive.
It was the first time the Albanian government, a staunch supporter of independence for Kosovo, has come out against a self-proclamation.
At the same time, Berisha acknowledged the chances of a new UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo are slim, due to Russia's opposition.

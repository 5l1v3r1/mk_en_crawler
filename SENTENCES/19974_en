BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Thursday (January 17th) ruled out the possible reopening of two older reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear plant in Bulgaria. 
EU Energy Commission spokesman Ferran Tarradellas said there is no possibility of negotiating a potential reopening. 
The government wants to reopen the two units, in light of the rising demand for electricity in the region and has hired lobbyists to press the matter.

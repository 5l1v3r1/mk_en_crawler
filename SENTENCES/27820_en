BUCHAREST, Romania -- By a vote of 45 to 31, the senate approved cutting personal income tax from 16% to 10% on Tuesday (November 23rd). 
Lawmakers from the senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party, including Economy Minister Ioan Ariton, proposed modifying the Fiscal Code to lower taxes on income from independent activities, wages, pensions, investments, agricultural business, prizes and other sources. 
Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu says the government opposes the move since the draft 2011 budget assumes a 16% flat tax. 
He predicts that the Chamber of Deputies will vote against the cut.

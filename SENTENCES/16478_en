MOSCOW, Russia -- Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling on Friday (9 June).
They agreed that BiH's sovereignty is not in question and that neither of the country's two entities has the authority to organise an independence referendum.
Russia is a guarantor to the Dayton Peace Accords.
The meeting was in response to a comment by Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who had suggested Banja Luka might organise a referendum similar to the one held last month in Montenegro.
In other news Friday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica paid a daylong visit to Banja Luka, where he met with Dodik and RS President Dragan Cavic.
Kostunica said the referendum was not discussed.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Defence Minister Milovan Stankovic said Wednesday (26 November) the country should not hold a referendum on proposed army reforms.
At this stage, he added, only the relevant authorities should take responsibility for ongoing reforms.
The proposal for a referendum came from an association representing families of war prisoners, war victims and missing persons.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, members of opposition parties reiterated calls for early general elections in BiH.
The recently signed co-operation agreement among the four largest opposition parties cites 2 October 2004 as a suitable date for early elections.

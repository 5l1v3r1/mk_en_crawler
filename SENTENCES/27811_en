SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Sunday (April 25th) that if "Republic of Northern Macedonia" is officially proposed as the name his country will use internationally -- to resolve its long-standing dispute with Greece -- it will be submitted to a referendum. 
He also said he personally would vote against it. 
Greek officials say the name would be acceptable to Athens. 
Gruevski said he expects UN mediator Matthew Nimetz to come up with a concrete suggestion for resolving the row in May, one acceptable to both Macedonia and Greece.
Meanwhile, a survey by the Institute for Democracy "Societas Civilis" suggests that 65% of Macedonians oppose a name change for the sake of joining NATO. 
Just over 80% of the respondents say they would vote for accession if a referendum were organised, compared to nearly 11% who would vote against.

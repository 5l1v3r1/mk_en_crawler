BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new poll indicates that the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) continues to enjoy public support, in advance of general elections in 2004 or 2005. 
The survey, conducted by the National Institute for Opinion Survey and Marketing, found that 49 per cent of voters would support the PSD if elections were held this week. 
That is a slight increase compared to the previous two months. 
In contrast, 15 per cent of the respondents expressed support for the opposition National Liberal Party, along with 14 per cent for the Greater Romania Party. 
The three parties were the only ones that passed the ten per cent threshold.

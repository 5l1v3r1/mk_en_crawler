WASHINGTON, United States -- The integrity of the Balkans will be complete when all countries from the region become members of the EU and NATO, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded at a day-long conference called "Completing America's Mission in the Balkans" in Washington on Tuesday (April 14th). 
CSIS official Janusz Bugajski, who organised the conference, noted that most countries in the region remain outside the two main support pillars of the West -- NATO and the EU. 
He added that potential instability scenarios may force the EU and the United States to reconfigure their roles in the region.
Separately Tuesday, French Secretary of State for EU Affairs Bruno Le Maire suggested the EU enlargement process should halt after the accession of the Western Balkan countries. 
"Attention should be focused on strengthening the European institutions," Le Maire said.

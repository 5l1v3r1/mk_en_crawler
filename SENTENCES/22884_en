BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) plans to sue the Netherlands and the UN for their alleged failure to protect the Serb population around Srebrenica from forces commanded by Naser Oric.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said Friday (July 4th) that Dutch forces allowed Oric and his troops to keep their arms, allowing the slaughter of Serb civilians.
He expressed grave disappointment with this week's release of Oric.
Oric, a former Bosnian Muslim army commander in Srebrenica, received a hero's welcome on his return Friday to BiH.
Some 300 people greeted him at the Sarajevo airport.

ATHENS, Greece -- A strike in the banking sector continued for a seventh day Wednesday (15 June), as trade unions in the sector rejected a government plan for pension reforms. 
The unions object to a government proposal for merging all existing main bank pension funds into the main social security fund.
Separately, employees in the public transport in Athens and Thessaloniki plan to walk off their jobs Thursday, again over proposed pension reforms.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political parties from Serbia reportedly have stepped up campaigning in northern Kosovo, ahead of the May 30th municipal elections.
Belgrade is organising the vote, which Pristina institutions consider illegal.
Kosovo public broadcaster RTK reported on Sunday (May 16th) that the priority of almost all Serbian parties is to oppose implementation of the government's strategy for the north, which aims to restore the rule of law in areas controlled by Serbian parallel structures.

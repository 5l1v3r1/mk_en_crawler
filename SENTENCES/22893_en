ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serbian Ambassador Radivoj Cvjeticanin is returning to his post and will resume his official duties Friday (November 7th), according to Belgrade. 
It recalled Cvjeticanin in March after Croatia recognised Kosovo's independence. 
Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said he hopes the return will be a good basis for strengthening relations between the two countries.

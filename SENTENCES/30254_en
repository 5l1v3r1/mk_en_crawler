SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM, said on Monday (February 21st) that early elections could be held in mid-June, provided the government meets several preconditions. 
The opposition insists on unfreezing A1 TV's bank accounts prior to even discussing other conditions -- passing a law on media funding and funding of election campaigns, changes to the electoral law, and updating the voters' list. 
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said at the weekend that he would discuss the early elections option if the opposition ends its boycott and returns to parliament.

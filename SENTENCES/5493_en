By Ksenija Jurkovic for Southeast European Times in Sibenik -- 09/07/10
Theatre troupes, artists, musicians, street performers and other entertainers gathered in the small Croatian town of Sibenik in June, as they have done for half a century. 
The International Children's Festival marked its 50-year jubilee, and organisers worked to put on an event worthy of the occasion.
SETimes contributor Ksenija Jurkovic was on the scene and spoke with children attending the event, as well as with the director of one of the festival's key theatrical productions.

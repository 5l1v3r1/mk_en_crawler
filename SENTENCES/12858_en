SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The top international envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, announced the formal launch of phase two of the police public information campaign at a news conference Friday (1 April). 
The second stage includes TV ads and related posters stressing that an independent, more professional police force will bring BiH closer to EU membership. 
Restructuring the police sector is a major requirement for launching Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks.

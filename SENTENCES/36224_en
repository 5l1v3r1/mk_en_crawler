ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic met with US Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky on Wednesday (3 March), to discuss EU expansion and Croatia's integration efforts. 
Dobriansky praised the country's success in implementing legislative and economic reforms, but said further steps are need to secure the return and reintegration of those displaced by war. 
Mesic said the government would rebuild destroyed dwellings but said additional measures are needed to boost economic development in war-scarred regions.

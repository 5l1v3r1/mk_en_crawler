BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Wednesday (January 12th) that a decision by Kosovo authorities to declare Serbia's new car plates with abbreviations of cities in Kosovo invalid is hasty and does not contribute to problem solving. 
He says it shows that Pristina is unwilling to hold talks on some issues, saying the plates should be addressed during upcoming talks between Belgrade and Pristina. 
He added that as Serbia considers Kosovo part of its territory, all citizens living there have the right to personal documents, driving licences and car plates. 
On Tuesday, outgoing Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi ordered authorities to confiscate the new registration plates, which Belgrade has been issuing for seven municipalities in Kosovo since January 1st. 
For now, Kosovo Serbs may use the old version of plates.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The new EU police mission in BiH (EUPM) launched its first operation late Thursday (2 January) when its officers monitored a Bosnian police raid on nightclubs suspected of involvement in prostitution and organised crime. 
Several individuals were questioned, though there were no arrests.EUPM chief Sven Frederiksen said the operation was meant to send a strong signal to criminals that the mission is committed to fighting human trafficking.
Meanwhile, the EU has approved a total of 78m euros in financial assistance to BiH for 2003 - a significant drop from the 190m euros provided in 2002. 
Michael Humphreys, the European Commission's representative in Sarajevo, said on Friday that the financing would go towards boosting the social and economic development of the country.
In separate news, Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic provided details about the entity's investigation into the Orao arms trading scandal.Speaking Saturday, Cavic said a number of senior army officers had been involved, though he cleared the Bosnian Serb civilian administration. 
He also said Belgrade-based Jugoimport had helped mastermind the plan to trade arms to Iraq, in violation of UN resolutions.

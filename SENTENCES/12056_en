ANKARA, Turkey -- The government said Saturday (12 February) that it is planning to establish a hotline for victims of trafficking in humans. 
A number of Russian-speaking operators would be hired because most of the women smuggled into Turkey by criminal gangs come from countries of the former Soviet Union.
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is to travel to Albania on Tuesday for talks with his counterpart Fatos Nano and others. 
On Wednesday, Erdogan will travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, stopping in Sarajevo and Mostar.

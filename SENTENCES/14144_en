NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian President Boris Tadic is proposing full autonomy for Kosovo and a delay of 20 years in the determination of the province's final status. 
Speaking to the UN Security Council on Tuesday (14 February), he criticised what he described as discrimination against the Serb minority and urged the adoption of international guarantees for the province's autonomy. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, who attended session as an observer, has rejected the proposal, saying that the moment to resolve the issue is now. 
Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged ethnic Albanian authorities to speed up the building of democratic institutions and guarantee the rights of minorities in the province.

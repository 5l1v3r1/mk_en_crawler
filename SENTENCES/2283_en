The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (6 April) praised the efforts Greek authorities are making to bring the country's large budget deficit into line with EU rules. 
In a statement, the EC said it has concluded the government is taking effective action to meet requirements set forth about two months ago.
"The Greek government must be praised not only for implementing the 2005 budget with rigour but also for announcing additional measures for this year," said Joaqu√≠n Almunia, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs. 
"Taking into account the existing risks, I welcome its commitment to present a budget for 2006 in which the deficit would be brought below 3 per cent of GDP."
In February, EU finance ministers gave Greece until the end of 2006 to bring its budget deficit under the 3 per cent of GDP limit applicable for Eurozone countries. 
If it fails to do so, the country could face court action and fines, they warned.
The government's revised stability programme for 2004-2007 shows the budget deficit as falling from 6.1 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 3.7 per cent this year and to 2.9 per cent in 2006. 
A further reduction of 0.5 per cent is projected for 2007, when the deficit is expected to shrink to 2.4 per cent of GDP.
However, the EU statistical office, Eurostat, has suggested that the 2004 deficit figure might have to be revised upwards after healthcare and Olympics-related expenditures for past years are finalised.
The government's strategy is based on a combination of measures to increase revenues and cut expenditures, enabling the accumulation of a primary surplus of 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2005. 
Warning of possible risks this year and beyond, the EC urged the country Wednesday to implement the necessary permanent measures to ensure that the 2006 budget deficit target will be met.
According to the revised Greek stability programme, real GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.9 per cent of GDP this year from 4.2 per cent in 2004, and then hold firm at 3.0 per cent in both 2006 and 2007. 
The EC expects Greece's debt to fall from 109.5 per cent of GDP this year to 104.7 per cent at the end of the three-year programme.
One of the measures Greece's centre-right government took recently to curb the budget deficit was to increase value added tax (VAT) from 18 per cent to 19 per cent as of 1 April. 
Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol were also raised. 
The increases, Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said last week, would be accompanied by additional measures to ensure that targets are met.
"We have a tough adjustment effort to make and we need to keep up the pressure on revenue collection," Alogoskoufis told the Financial Times last week."We're also cracking down on VAT evasion and an extensive contraband trade in fuel."

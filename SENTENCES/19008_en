SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Minister of Culture Ilirjan Bekiri submitted his resignation Monday (April 2nd) to Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who immediately accepted it. 
Bekiri decided to step down amid the backlash that followed his decision to ban the play "Tito, Certain Diagrams of Hope". 
Bekiri, a prominent member of the Democratic Party of Albanians, said the play threatened the "national interest". 
The ban was lifted after the play's director publicly complained.
In other news, the Interior Ministry began issuing new biometric passports Monday. 
They will contain an electronic chip and are designed to meet the latest EU standards.

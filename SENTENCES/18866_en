BERLIN, Germany -- Rear Admiral Hans-Jochen Witthauer on Tuesday (December 5th) replaced Italian General Marco Chiarini as head of the 6,000-strong EU-led peacekeeping force, EUFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung was among those attending the ceremony near Sarajevo.
He said the EU leaders are expected to adopt a four-stage plan later this month for ending the Union's military presence in BiH.
The first stage could begin as early as May or June 2007.
Germany, the minister added, hopes to withdraw some of its soldiers by the end of next year.

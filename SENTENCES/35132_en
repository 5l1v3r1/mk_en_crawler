ANKARA, Turkey -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen said Tuesday (24 February) that having a strong partner like Turkey might play an important role for Europe's political and economic stability. 
Referring to statements by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder which underscored Germany's support for Turkey's EU bid, Verheugen said this attitude indicated strategic considerations shared by all European leaders.

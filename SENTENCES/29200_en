SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Ali Ahmeti, leader of ethnic Albanian junior coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), opposes any scenario that could lead to the partition of Macedonia. 
In an interview with BBC in Albanian on Tuesday (May 4th), Ahmeti urged Albanians in Macedonia to ignore provocations, a reference to a shooting last week near the border with Kosovo where police found a large stash of weapons. 
A group representing itself as the National Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the incident.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Representative in Macedonia Erwan Fouere criticised the government and political parties Thursday (July 8th) for avoiding dialogue and delaying the reform process. 
At a meeting of parliament's EU affairs committee, he said that Macedonia has enough time -- ahead of the European Commission's next progress report in November -- to gain some ground. 
Fouere also called for strengthening the judiciary and public administration. 
Belgian Ambassador Mark Mickelson, who also attended the meeting, presented his country's priorities as the current EU presidency holder. 
He reiterated that each country will be assessed on its individual merits.

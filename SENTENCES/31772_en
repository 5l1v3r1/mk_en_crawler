BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry will tighten entry requirements for visitors from a number of countries in Africa, South America and Asia, according to local media reports Tuesday (7 January).
Travellers would be expected to show that they have health insurance and reserved accommodations.
Students will be required to prove they have at least 250 euros per month for the duration of their stay.
The move is seen as part of Romania's efforts to join the EU in 2007.
The country has been urged to stem the flow of illegal immigrants.

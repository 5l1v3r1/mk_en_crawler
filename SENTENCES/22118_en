ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (September 16th) accused the EU of delaying Turkey's bid to join the Union.
"The stronger our resolution and perseverance, the more the EU reacts with declarations and practices that kill our enthusiasm and motivation.

opened up the doors," Erdogan said at a dinner with foreign diplomats.
He urged the EU to adopt the same approach towards Turkey that it has for other candidates.

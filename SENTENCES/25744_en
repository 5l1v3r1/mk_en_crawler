BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece's EU Commissioner-designate for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Maria Damanaki passed confirmation hearings in the European Parliament (EP) on Tuesday (January 19th).
Afterwards, the EP said that members raised a series of issues, including EU fisheries policy reform and funding, bringing decision-making closer to those directly involved, environmentally-sustainable fishing, and competition.
Gido Milano, deputy president of the Fisheries Commission, said Damanaki appeared competent and capable of becoming a member of the new European Commission.

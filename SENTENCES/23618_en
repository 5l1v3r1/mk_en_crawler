THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of Vlastimir Djordjevic, former head of the Serbian Public Security Department, kicked off at The Hague war crimes tribunal Tuesday (January 27th). 
Prosecutors say Djordjevic participated in an ethnic cleansing campaign against Albanian civilians in Kosovo between January 1st and June 20th 1999. 
The perpetrators killed thousands of civilians during the conflict and banished another 800,000 from their homes, the prosecution added. 
Police arrested Djordjevic, 60, in June 2007 in Montenegro and extradited him to The Hague.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Police on Wednesday (19 March) arrested a deputy prosecutor for alleged ties to the organised crime group known as the Zemun gang, suspected in last week's assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Tanjug reports that Milan Sarajlic's home and office were searched.
He is the first official arrested in the course of the new clampdown on organised crime.
More than 750 suspected mafia members are in custody.
Meanwhile, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinator on Kosovo Nebojsa Covic said Wednesday that the new government would maintain Djinjdic's policy towards Kosovo.
Pristina and Belgrade officials will meet as planned next week, at the urging of UNMIK chief Michael Steiner.

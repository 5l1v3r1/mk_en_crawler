TIRANA, Albania -- On Tuesday (1 April), the head of the OSCE office in Albania, Ambassador Osmo Lipponen, praised the progress achieved in electoral reform, a reference to an agreement reached by parliament's bipartisan commission on amendments to the electoral code.
The new draft will be submitted for debate within a week.
Lipponen cited agreements on the issues of media coverage, the responsibilities of state authorities and police in the election process, as well as procedures for complaints and appeals.
Albania will hold local elections in the autumn.
In other news, the US State Department issued a report Tuesday, concluding that Albania's human rights record continues to be poor.
Analysts cited high crime rates and minimal confidence in law enforcement, as well as a judiciary unable to function "independently and efficiently".

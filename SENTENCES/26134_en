NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot officials announced on Tuesday (October 13th) that they have decided to cancel their annual joint military exercise with Turkey, in a bid to boost ongoing reunification talks regarding the divided island.
The annual manoeuvres are usually held in November.
Greek Cypriots, in turn, announced that they are cancelling this year's Nikiforos military manoeuvres involving their National Guard.
President Demetris Christofias first proposed the move in September, during a meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York.

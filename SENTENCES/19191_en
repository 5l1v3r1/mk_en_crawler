MOSCOW, Russia -- In an official statement published on Tuesday (January 29th) the Russian Foreign Ministry warned the EU that unilaterally proceeding with a police and administrative mission to Kosovo would violate international law.
It said such a move first requires UN approval.
"We understand that the EU wants to play a more active role in the Kosovo issue, but it is only possible if these conditions are fulfilled," the ministry said.
It called on the EU and the UN from taking any unilateral steps on Kosovo that would create a "destructive precedent for international relations".

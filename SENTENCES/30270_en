SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Election Commission (CIK) is expected to hold an extraordinary session on Monday (March 21st) to discuss the formation of new Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) authorities. 
Outgoing FBiH President Borjana Kristo has filed a complaint claiming the constitution and the election law were violated during last week's constitutive session of the House of Peoples, which was held despite a boycott by the two main Croat parties, HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990. 
The CIK has already said that the conditions for holding the constitutive session of the upper house of the FBiH parliament were not met as three Croat-dominated cantons had failed to nominate their delegates. 
The session was followed by the election of the entity's new president, vice-presidents and government.

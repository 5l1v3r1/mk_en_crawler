PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK is recommending that Pristina and Belgrade launch talks about issues of mutual interest, but without any mediators involved.
The mission, however, is consulting with UN headquarters in New York to determine if it should facilitate talks in the future, UNMIK spokesman Russell Geekie said on Monday (September 6th).
"We are ready to play a role, but the sides involved in talks should set the agenda.
We would like direct talks, but there is no official stance from the EU and its role," Geekie said.
Kosovo's government continues to object to any meetings involving status or territories.
The International Crisis Group has suggested the appointment of an envoy who would facilitate talks between Belgrade and Pristina.

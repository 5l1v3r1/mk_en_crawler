LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Ratification of Croatia's entry into NATO moved closer on Monday (January 26th), after the foreign policy committee in Slovenia's parliament voted 16-3 to approve the ratification of Zagreb's treaty.
All members of the committee from the ruling coalition supported the document, arguing it would contribute to regional stability and would be viewed as a constructive move by the international community.
It goes to the full parliament for approval on Thursday.
Some had speculated Slovenia might block Croatia's entry to NATO over a long-standing border dispute.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader called again on Monday to resolve the matter through international arbitration.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Kosovo, Ulrike Lunacek, is concerned that the EU is losing control and support among Kosovars since the country has been excluded from the bloc's visa liberalisation process. 
She urged policymakers to start the process for Kosovo as soon as possible. 
Lunacek's comments came in Brussels on Wednesday (December 1st), where Belgian Foreign Minister Steven Vanackere -- whose country holds the rotating EU presidency -- presented the bloc's Enlargement Strategy. 
He confirmed that the visa liberalisation process for Kosovo depends on Pristina fulfilling a series of conditions, primarily a strategy for the reintegration of returnees. 
However, Vanackere reiterated that Kosovars have a European future. 
He refuted statements of some of the lawmakers that the lack of recognition of Kosovo's independence by five EU member states has an impact on the citizens' trust in the EU and EULEX Mission.

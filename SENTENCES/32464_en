ANKARA, Turkey -- The Council of Ministers held a special meeting Tuesday (18 March) about a motion to assist the United States in a military campaign against Iraq.
Reuters quotes diplomatic sources as saying this motion may involve only the opening of air corridors and the transit of special forces, not the deployment of 62,000 troops requested in a plan parliament rejected on 1 March.
Lawmakers are expected to vote on it Wednesday, the same day Saddam Hussein must leave Iraq or face attack, according to US President George W Bush.
Reuters reports that anticipation of a deal triggered a sharp recovery on Turkey's financial markets Tuesday.

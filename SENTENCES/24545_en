PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Six Serb political parties have registered with the Central Election Commission (CEC) to run in the November 15th local elections.
CEC officials said on Wednesday (July 8th) that in all, 36 political entities representing the various communities in Kosovo have submitted applications.
In other news Wednesday, EULEX and local police arrested Kacanik Municipality Mayor Xhabir Zharku.
He was first accused of abducting, torturing, and threatening people involved in a property sale he wanted to stop last fall.
A weapons charge followed that.
This time, he was arrested for violating a court order to stay away from witnesses, but was later released on bail.
Also Wednesday, the Kosovo Democratic Institute -- in partnership with Transparency International -- published a six-month report that concludes the judiciary is the most corrupt system in the country.
Citizens complain of several problems, including lengthy procedures in civil cases and court decisions that are not implemented.

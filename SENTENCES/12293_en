WASHINGTON, United States -- UN special envoy Matthew Nimitz has suggested a compromise to end the deadlock in the long-running name dispute between Greece and Macedonia.
The UN has suggested adopting the name Republika Makedonija-Skopje.
If accepted, the name would be used without being translated.
Both countries cautiously rejected the idea, but Greece signalled that the proposal could be used as a basis for constructive negotiations.
Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said his government preferred to stick to the current "double formula" -- that is, Skopje uses the name Republic of Macedonia internationally, except in communications with Greece.
The US State Department, meanwhile, praised the "new momentum" in the talks and urged both sides to seize the opportunity and engage in constructive dialogue.
The next round of bilateral negotiations held under UN auspices begins Monday in New York.

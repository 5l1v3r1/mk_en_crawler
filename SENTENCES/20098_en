PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker urged all Serbs on Friday (September 14th) to vote in the autumn elections in the province.
"It is crucial for Kosovo Serbs to take part in the elections on November 17th so that they can fully participate in the legitimate institutions of Kosovo," Ruecker said in a statement.
He also urged Belgrade not to discourage the participation of Kosovo Serbs.
"Democracy must be allowed to run its course -- everywhere," Ruecker said.
On Thursday, Serbian President Boris Tadic officially urged all Kosovo Serbs to boycott the November election.
He said the vote would be "counterproductive", given ongoing negotiations on the breakaway province's final status.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU resumed its Stabilisation and Association (SAA) talks with Serbia on Wednesday (June 13th), following word the country has made progress in co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The EC has made clear that full co-operation, including the arrest and extradition of remaining fugitives, remains a condition for sealing a SAA deal with Serbia.
On Tuesday, US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues Clint Williamson welcomed the recent assessment by UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte. 
Citing the arrest of Zdravko Tolimir, Williamson said Serbia has shown progress in its co-operation.

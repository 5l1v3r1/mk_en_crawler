BUCHAREST, Romania -- Matthew Newman, spokesman for EU Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Commissioner Viviane Reding, told EurActiv on Monday (August 23rd) that ongoing tension over the repatriation of hundreds of Roma from France to Romania should not affect Bucharest and Sofia's ambitions to join Schengen. 
He was asked to comment after the Romanian daily Romania Libera recently reported that Bucharest will be left out of Schengen because of the Roma. 
Romania and Bulgaria are hoping to join Schengen in March 2011. 
French Secretary Pierre Lellouche, however, was quoted as hinting that the decision may be postponed if Bucharest fails to better integrate the Roma community. 
"The integration of minorities is not part of the Schengen acquis," Newman said on Tuesday.

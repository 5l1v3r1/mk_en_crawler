SUCEAVA, Romania -- The chief of the European Commission delegation to Bucharest, Jonathan Scheele, said Monday (22 September) that functioning market economy status would be given to Romania only after the government implements all planned reforms.
The action plan that Prime Minister Adrian Nastase presented in Brussels last week does not automatically guarantee the status, though failure to comply with the plan would endanger the country's chances of obtaining it, Scheele said.
In other news, the president of Italy's Senate, Marcello Para, expressed his country's support for Romania's bids to join the EU and NATO.
During a visit to Bucharest Monday, Para said that Italy, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, would back efforts to complete accession talks with the EU in 2004.

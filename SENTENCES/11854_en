TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) confirmed on Thursday (14 July) the victory of the Democrats and their allies in the general election. 
The party of former President Sali Berisha will have an absolute majority with 73 of 140 seats. 
The Socialist alliance will get 64 seats. 
The results are not final yet, as the CEC continues to investigate numerous complaints of irregularities. 
Ballot counts continue in three of Albania's 100 electoral districts. 
The election was held on 3 July. 
OSCE's chairman-in-office, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, called on all parties Thursday to respect the decisions of the CEC and the Electoral College, which he said should deal professionally, impartially and resolutely with all election irregularities, complaints and appeals.

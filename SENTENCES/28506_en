BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Tuesday (May 11th) that Kosovo must do two things -- implement re-admission agreements and integrate returnees -- before the EU can even consider initiating a dialogue on visa liberalisation.
"It is important that Kosovo too understands and knows the conditions," Fuele said, adding that the EU would need to send a verification mission to begin a dialogue on visas.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The independence referendum campaign in Montenegro officially closes Thursday (18 May) at midnight. 
Afterwards, a 48-hour blackout will be imposed until the poll takes place on Sunday. 
At least 55 per cent of the participating voters must support independence in order for it to succeed. 
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic squared off in a televised debate Wednesday evening against Predrag Bulatovic, leader of the bloc opposing independence from Serbia. 
Separately, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica urged Montenegrins to vote for continuing the union with Belgrade.

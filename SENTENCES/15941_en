TIRANA, Albania -- Hundreds of pensioners protested in Tirana on Wednesday (October 18th), demanding that the Democratic Party-led government keep its campaign promise and raise their pensions next year.
The demonstrators called for the funding to be included in the 2007 budget law.
In neighbouring Greece, meanwhile, protests by pre-school and primary teachers continued for a fifth week Wednesday.
Teachers are seeking raises of 40% and say they will continue protests until Christmas, prompting the education ministry to consider extending the school year.

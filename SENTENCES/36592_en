SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Pilot error caused the plane crash which killed Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski on 26 February, BiH Communication and Transport Minister Branko Dokic said Wednesday (5 May). 
He presented a 75-page report on the accident prepared by experts from the United States, BiH, Macedonia, and NATO. 
According to the report, the two-man crew miscalculated the plane's distance from Mostar Airport and reduced altitude too early. 
The plane also lost the beacon signal from the airport for 18 seconds and should have aborted its landing approach. 
Killed with Trajkovski were seven advisers and the two pilots.

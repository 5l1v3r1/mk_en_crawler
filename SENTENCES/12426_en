TIRANA, Albania -- Defence Minister Pandeli Majko and EU security chief Javier Solana have sealed an agreement on Albanian participation in the EU military mission in BiH, according to press reports in Tirana Wednesday (9 March).
The agreement was reached during Majko's visit to Brussels earlier this week.
Albania is expected to contribute 50 troops to the currently 7,000-strong EUFOR mission, which took over peacekeeping duties in BiH from NATO in December 2004.
During his stay in the Belgian capital, Majko also visited NATO headquarters, where he met with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.

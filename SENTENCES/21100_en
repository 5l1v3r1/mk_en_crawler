WASHINGTON, United States -- Pentagon spokesperson Almarah Belk reiterated on Sunday (December 2nd) that while the United States recognises Turkey's right to defend itself with a military operation against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Washington is co-operating closely with the Turkish and the Iraqi governments to find a long-term solution to the issue.
The Turkish military attacked a base in northern Iraq on Saturday and officials say more attacks could follow, based on intelligence information.
Kurdish militants first denied any such attack, though a senior PKK member -- demanding anonymity -- later confirmed it to AFP.
After the air strike Saturday, Turkish troops killed four PKK rebels in two separate skirmishes near the border with Iraq.

STRASBOURG, France -- Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme, whose country took over the rotating EU presidency on July 1st, reiterated on Wednesday (July 7th) that the EU will assess the integration of the Western Balkan countries individually, on a state-by-state basis.
There has been speculation that after Croatia's expected accession, the EU would wait to accept the rest of the Western Balkans en masse, so that countries capable of implementing necessary reforms faster would have to wait for more sluggish EU candidates.
Leterme told EP members that each country will be assessed on its merits, adding there are no shortcuts to accession.

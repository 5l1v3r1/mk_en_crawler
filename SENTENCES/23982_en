LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar on Monday (March 16th) called for the postponement of the EU accession conference with Croatia, scheduled for March 27th. 
According to Zbogar, Slovenian and Croatian officials will not reach a deal on mediating their border dispute by the end of the month. 
Slovenia blocked Croatia's EU accession talks last year over fears that Zagreb's entry may influence the outcome of their years-long border dispute. 
The two sides have accepted an EU initiative for mediation by the European Commission (EC). 
Croatia wants the EC to help it prepare its case for review by the International Court of Justice. 
Slovenia says the mediation itself should resolve the conflict.
In other news Monday, Zagreb's city council rejected an initiative to hold a referendum on changing the name of Marshal Tito Square, named after the former communist dictator. 
Proponents wanted to rename it Theatre Square.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN-run Kosovo Trust Agency announced on Tuesday (10 May) the privatisation of 15 publicly-owned companies.
They include a producer of plastic moldings, a pharmaceutical wholesale trading company, a rubber products factory, an electrical mill, a brick factory, warehouses, a clothing producer and a mineral water bottling plant.
Most of the businesses will be sold to the highest bidder, but two will be sold to firms that sign agreements with the government on employment numbers and working conditions.

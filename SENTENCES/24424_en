BUCHAREST, Romania -- Senators agreed on Wednesday (June 10th) to strip fellow member Serban Mihailescu's immunity from prosecution, as requested by the National Anticorruption Directorate.
Investigators say Mihailescu, of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), is accused of corruption and violating gun trade and possession laws.
This marks the first time the Senate voted to lift the immunity of a colleague.
In other news, President Traian Basescu confirmed on Thursday the 33 members of the European Parliament (EP) that Romanian voters elected Sunday.
Half of them will enter the EP for the first time, and most are from the PSD and the Liberal Democratic Party.

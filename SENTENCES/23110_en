BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Thursday (May 1st) that the "functional separation of the Serbs in Kosovo is inevitable". 
"There is a problem and I think that a solution should be found in co-operation with the UN mission," Kostunica told the local Palma Plus television channel. 
He added that the UN mission is "the only legal civil mission in Kosovo". 
Yet he noted Serbia plans to hold local elections in Serb enclaves of Kosovo on May 11th, despite opposition, reiterated just this week, by UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker.

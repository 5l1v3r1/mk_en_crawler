BERLIN, Germany -- Police arrested a 47-year-old Turkish national suspected of having led the German branch of the terrorist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) up until last month, federal prosecutors announced on Tuesday (July 22nd). 
The detainee, identified as Huseyin A, was arrested in the western city of Detmold on Monday. 
He allegedly led the PKK's underground German organisation for the past year, according to the DPA news agency. 
Germany outlawed the PKK in 1993. 
Last month, German authorities banned the pro-Kurdish Roj TV. 
Police say the PKK planned to assassinate German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for his role in the ban.

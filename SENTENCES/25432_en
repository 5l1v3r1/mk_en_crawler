BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Nis court has posthumously rehabilitated former Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragisa Cvetkovic, who signed a March 1941 pact with which Yugoslavia joined the Axis powers.
The decision Friday (September 25th) annulled an earlier one by the Yugoslav State Commission, which declared Cvetkovic an enemy of the people and a war criminal.
On March 27th, 1941, two days after the pact was signed, Cvetkovic's government was brought down by a military coup.
Cvetkovic was jailed and then released, and later withdrew from public life.
In 1944, he fled the country and settled down in Paris, where he lived until his death in 1969.

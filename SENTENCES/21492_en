BELGRADE, Serbia â Serbian police arrested basketball player Miladin Kovacevic, whom police in the United States want for beating a fellow Binghamton University student into a coma in May, in Belgrade on Tuesday (October 28th).
The authorities seized Kovacevic, 20, who fled the United States after the incident with the help of the then-Serbian consul in New York, in accordance with a court order.
Police also arrested the former consul, Slobodan Nenadovic, police spokesperson Suzana Vasilevic announced.
The two will remain in custody for 30 days.
Kovacevic, who began playing in the Serbian championship after leaving the United States, faces trial in Serbia because the country bars the extradition of its nationals to other countries.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Recep Tayip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, told reporters before his departure for Copenhagen on Monday (9 December) that there was at least a 50 per cent chance that his country could get a date for the start of accession talks at the upcoming EU summit.
He added that he hopes his Tuesday meeting with US President George W Bush would boost Turkey's bid.
In other news, an IMF mission arrived Sunday in Turkey to review the stand-by arrangement signed last year.
Talks were suspended in October, as some of the Fund's major requirements had not been met.
Since then, Turkey has elected a new government that endorses economic reforms.

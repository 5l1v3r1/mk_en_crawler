TIRANA, Albania -- Visa liberalisation between the EU and Western Balkan countries is not progressing, the European Citizen Action Service said in a report cited by Albanian media Wednesday (August 13th).
Several barriers in the process prevent citizens from getting a visa as they did in the past, the report notes, suggesting that these countries should implement the agreement and reach full liberalisation.
Albania, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a visa liberalisation agreement with the EU in January.

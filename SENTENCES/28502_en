BELGRADE, Serbia -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz arrives on Wednesday (May 12th) for a two-day visit to Serbia, ahead of his report to the UN Security Council in June. 
Brammertz's assessment of Belgrade's co-operation with the court will be crucial to Serbia's EU bid. 
He is expected to meet with President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic and national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal head Rasim Ljajic.

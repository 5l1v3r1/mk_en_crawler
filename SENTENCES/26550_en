BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Vojvodina Hungarians' Union (SVM) decided on Wednesday (February 10th) to oust its honourary president, Jozef Kasa.
The party's disciplinary commission ruled that in statements to the media, Kasa undermined the SVM's leadership by misinterpreting its political decisions.
The party also ousted official Zoltan Bunjik.

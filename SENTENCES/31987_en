ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer called on the new government on Sunday (24 November) to uphold secularism and not to use the issue of headscarves to inflame religious tensions. 
His remarks came a day after Prime Minister Abdullah Gul signalled in a speech to parliament that his Islamic-rooted party would move to lift a measure that bans women from wearing scarves in schools and universities. 
Sezer warned that the issue of scarves should not be revisited as the Constitutional Court has already ruled on it. 
It resurfaced last week after the wife of Bulent Arinc, the new parliament speaker, wore a scarf to a public function.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis met Sunday with the leader of the Cypriot Turks Rauf Denktas in New York. 
Their focus was the peace plan for Cyprus sponsored by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
Denktas has rejected the plan as being unacceptable to the interests of Cypriot Turks, while Dervis Eroglu, prime minister of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" says it satisfies only the interests of the Greek community. 
The EU has urged Ankara to resolve the matter if it hopes for a firm date to start accession talks.

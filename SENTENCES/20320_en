SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A Macedonian helicopter carrying troops returning from the EU mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina crashed near Skopje on Saturday (January 12th), killing all 11 people on board.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski ruled out sabotage, saying the crash was an accident.
The helicopter dropped and burst into flames as it approached a landing strip at the local airport, strewing wreckage across a wide area.
The chief of staff of the Macedonian Army, Miroslav Stojanovski, reported at a cabinet meeting that the Russian-made Mi-17 had been serviced regularly and was operated by an experienced military crew.
A special commission has been established to investigate the incident.
The country is observing three days of mourning.

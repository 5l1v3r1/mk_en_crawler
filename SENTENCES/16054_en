BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, leader of the ruling National Liberal Party (PNL), said on Monday (14 August) that the party may withdraw its support for PNL deputy Mona Musca. 
Late last week, Musca, one of the country's most popular politicians, admitted that in 1977 she had sealed an agreement to collaborate with Securitate, though she insists she was never an informant. 
Local media reports suggest the PNL has discussed whether to expel her from the party.

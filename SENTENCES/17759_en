MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov again called on the international community not to hurry a decision on Kosovo's future status, in an interview Friday (May 18th). 
Speaking on the local Vesti news channel, Lavrov reiterated Moscow's support for the continuation of UN-mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina to reach a mutually acceptable solution. 
Russia insists that a unilateral solution would set a precedent that could have negative consequences internationally.
A spokesman for former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari explicitly rejected any prospect for new negotiations. 
Remi Dourlot said on Friday that Ahtisaari's office is due to close soon, as it has completed its mission.

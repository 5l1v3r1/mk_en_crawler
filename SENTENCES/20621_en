SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The foreign ministry expressed concern Thursday (November 8th) over a comment by Greek clergyman Anthimos, the hardliner Metropolitan Bishop of Thessaloniki, who said that parts of Macedonia belonged to Greece and "should be returned".
The Macedonian government urged Greek authorities to condemn such comments.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis stressed that neither her government nor the public support Anthimos' call.

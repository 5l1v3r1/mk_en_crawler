SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Energy Minister Traicho Traikov said on Tuesday (February 16th) that Sofia may seek higher transit fees for Russian gas passing through its territory en route to other Balkan countries.
Traikov gave no exact figures but pointed out that similar fees charged by countries are twice the amount Bulgaria collects.
The statement came after an unexpected visit by Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller.
While in Sofia, Miller also met with President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.
Discussions focused on the South Stream pipeline project and gas supply contracts that will replace those set to expire this year.

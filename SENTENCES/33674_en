BUCHAREST, Romania -- Border police last week arrested an Egyptian citizen suspected of links to the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation.
According to a press release issued Friday (5 September) the arrest followed a tip from the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI).
The suspect was detained while trying to cross from Romania to Hungary.
According to the SRI, 24-year-old Rezk Karim Zekri Saad had documents showing his connection to Islamic Jihad.
He had been in Romania since 13 August and had established contacts with other foreign residents there that the SRI was also monitoring.
In other news, Romania's major opposition National Liberal Party is considering negotiations on a possible coalition with the small Humanitarian Party (PUR) in future general elections.
PUR withdrew from the ruling coalition led by the Social Democratic Party late last month.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Syria, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon agreed on Thursday (June 10th) to establish a free trade and visa-free zone. 
The foreign ministers of the four countries issued a joint declaration on the agreement on the sidelines of a Turkish-Arab Co-operation (TAC) Forum in Istanbul. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu stressed that the initiative to boost bilateral and multilateral ties in the region should not be considered an alternative to Turkey's EU bid. 
He urged the Union to take advantage of Turkey's closer ties to countries in the region and the investment opportunities they offer.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The third round of negotiations on expanding the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) began in Brussels on Wednesday (13 September).
The three-day talks involve representatives of Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania -- the four current members of CEFTA -- and candidate countries Albania, BiH, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as UNMIK.
Discussions are aimed at ironing out the text of the CEFTA deal, which would replace 31 existing bilateral Free Trade Agreements in the region.

The goal of this year's Croatia Summit -- a high-level meeting of regional leaders, EU and NATO representatives -- was to show common readiness for regional co-operation. 
The 5th annual summit was held on Friday (July 9th) and Saturday in Dubrovnik.
Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor welcomed 15 prime ministers and foreign ministers as well as EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele.
"Croatia and Southeast Europe, in terms of their value system, belong to the Euro-Atlantic family and it is only natural for them to seek their future in the EU and NATO. 
We should co-operate and help each other on the integration road and show how serious we are," Kosor said in her opening address.
The summit was attended by the prime ministers of France Francois Fillon; Bulgaria, Boyko Borisov; Albania, Sali Berisha; Poland, Donald Tusk; Kosovo, Hashim Thaci; and Slovenia, Borut Pahor.
Croatian President Ivo Josipovic said the summit "also [served to promote] Croatia in the region and in Europe".
However, the regional harmony was visibly disrupted by the fact that Serbian President Boris Tadic opted out. 
The presence of a high-level Kosovo delegation, led by Thaci, dissuaded the Serb delegation's attendance.
Pahor criticised the move. 
"We should do everything in our power to continue the dialogue, even it is not always easy."
The Slovenian prime minister, who was praised for resolving his country's problems with neighbouring Croatia, tried to promote the EU perspective for the region.
"I call on Brussels not to ignore Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia," Pahor said, adding that it is crucial that the EU provide a clear picture of its integration future to the region.
The leaders also discussed the global economic crisis impact, as most of the countries are being affected by the downturn.

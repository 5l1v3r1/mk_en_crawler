BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and the EU sealed an agreement Tuesday (April 10th) in Brussels on visa facilitation and readmission. 
The accord, however, would not take effect for six or seven months because it must be endorsed by the EU Council and the BiH Parliament. 
This accord "is a clear signal that the EU is keeping the door open for Bosnia and Herzegovina and that it will keep to its commitments on the European perspective of the country", according to a press release from Brussels, which also described the move as a first step towards visa-free travel. 
The EU is expected to sign similar agreements with Serbia and Macedonia this week.
In other news, the BiH Commission on Missing Persons began excavating a pit near the eastern Bosnian Serb town of Visegrad on Tuesday. 
The pit, peppered with mines, is believed to be a mass grave containing the remains of several dozen Bosnian Muslims killed by Bosnian Serbs in the 1992-1995 conflict.

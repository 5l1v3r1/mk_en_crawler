ZAGREB, Croatia -- The former leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) Ivica Racan returned to Zagreb late Saturday (March 10th) from Munich, where he underwent surgery a few weeks ago. 
Last month, he was diagnosed with cancer and announced his temporary withdrawal from politics. 
He will continue to receive treatment in Croatia.
SDP's main committee, meanwhile, met on Saturday, to discuss preparations for the November parliamentary elections. 
Acting leader Zeljka Antunovic says the party will pledge to boost economic growth by 6% and create at least 80,000 new jobs.

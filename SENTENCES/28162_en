TIRANA, Albania -- The Serbian language will be taught in southern Albania to benefit a Serb community living in the Libofsh municipality.
Serbian Ambassador to Tirana Miroljub Zaric inaugurated the learning programme on Saturday (September 18th) and promised that similar schools will open in other parts of the country.
Lessons to about 60 children will be taught in Serbian during regular classes in the village of Rrethlibofshe.
The Serb community arrived in Albania in 1924, from Novi Pazar.
Many of them have preserved their Serbian traditions.

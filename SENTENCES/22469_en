SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak on Wednesday (September 10th) warned against exploitation of proceedings at The Hague against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to fan nationalism in BiH.
"Karadzic's arrest had the potential to aid reconciliation in the country.
Sadly, because of the way it has been portrayed in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, it has gone in the opposite direction, towards further divisions, accusations and rising nationalism," Lajcak said in an interview with the daily Dnevnik.

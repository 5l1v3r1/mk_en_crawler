SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative, as well as the missions of the IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission in BiH, criticised two new legislative initiatives on Tuesday (19 September), warning that they threaten the country's fiscal stability. 
They were referring to the adoption by the BiH Parliament's lower house of changes in the law on foreign currency savings debt, and the endorsement by the Federation of BiH's (FBiH) lower house of an amended law on the rights of war veterans. 
Both are seen as populist moves made ahead of the October general elections.

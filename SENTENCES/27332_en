NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The British bases command in Cyprus issued a written statement Monday (November 30th) confirming media reports that staff is being relocated from one of its two bases on the island, but denied any "downgrading" of forces. 
According to the statement, the base in Dekelia is being vacated only for renovations. 
Staffers that have been moved to Akrotiri will return to Dekelia after the work is done. 
The command adds that 80 British troops will return home, since, along with a group of 62 local engineers, they were members of a support unit that is being disbanded. 
The state-run Cyprus Broadcasting Station reported on Sunday that several hundred troops at the Dekelia base in Larnaca have returned to the UK, while a smaller number were relocated to the base in Akrotiri.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Balkan states have made "historic progress" developing their ties, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (May 10th).
"The transition towards regional ownership of political co-operation is moving well ahead and it has gone better than expected," he added.
Rehn also praised the reforms in the area, citing the recent EU accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the progress some countries in the Western Balkans have made towards membership.
His comments followed a meeting of the Balkan Stability Pact in Zagreb.
The Balkan countries decided to establish a Regional Co-operation Council to replace the Pact.
It will be based in Sarajevo and headed by a Croatian diplomat.

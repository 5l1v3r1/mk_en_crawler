TIRANA, Albania -- The restoration of Skenderbej Square in Tirana has sparked a new row between the Democratic Party (DP)-led government and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) whose leader, Edi Rama, is mayor of the capital. 
On Sunday (March 28th), Rama officially inaugurated work on the 4.3m-euro restoration project, financed by a donation from Kuwait. 
But Transport Minister Sokol Olldashi of the DP said the project will be halted because it does not comply with urban planning.

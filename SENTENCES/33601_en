LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Anton Rop on Monday (15 September) softened his government's tone with regard to a border dispute with Croatia. 
In remarks at a foreign policy meeting, he said that Slovenia would support Croatia's bid to join the EU despite the differences Ljubljana and Zagreb have over their common border in Piran Bay. 
Slovenia had threatened to block Croatia's accession if it went ahead with plans to set up an exclusive economic zone in the Adriatic. 
The move would leave Ljubljana without access to international shipping waters.

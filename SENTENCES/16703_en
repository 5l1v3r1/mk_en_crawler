BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Thousands of people gathered in Belgrade on Tuesday (9 May) to demand the resignation of Vojislav Kostunica's government over its failure to arrest Ratko Mladic.
They accused the prime minister of failing to distance the country from the regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
Cedomir Jovanovic, of the opposition Liberal Democrats, called for early elections to replace the current cabinet.
The EU halted Stabilisation and Association talks with Serbia-Montengro last week for failing to capture Mladic by the end-of-April deadline.
Also Tuesday, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic described the Mladic situation as a shared failure by federal union authorities and the international community.
He insisted the government has the will to hand over the fugitive.(Danas - 10/05/06;

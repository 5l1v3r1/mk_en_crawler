SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev on Wednesday (April 18th) expressed deep dissatisfaction with the work of the country's prosecutors and demanded urgent steps to improve their performance.
Meeting with the heads of regional and appeals court prosecutions, he criticised the huge number of delays and postponements, and suggested that a substantial number of prosecutors are incapable of closing cases.
Hundreds of thousands of cases have ended up being dismissed by the courts.

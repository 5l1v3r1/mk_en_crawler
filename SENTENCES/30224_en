BELGRADE, Serbia -- Stefano Sannino, deputy director-general of the EU's Directorate General for Enlargement, said on Monday (May 16th) there is a chance that Serbia gets EU candidate status by the end of the year, but that more reforms are needed.
Sannino attended a conference in Belgrade marking the 10th anniversary of the OSCE's mission in Serbia.
He said he expects the country will receive good news regarding its EU bid in October, when the European Commission publishes its report on Serbia.

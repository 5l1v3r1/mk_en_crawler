SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The centre-right Blue Coalition and the conservative Order, Law, Justice Party (RZS) refused on Friday (July 17th) to sign a memorandum to support the minority government formed by the Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB). 
Blue Coalition leaders said the party won't join the proposed political partnership, as it was not offered any concrete programme. 
However, it will support the new government when it is put to the vote in parliament, most likely on July 27th, party officials said. 
The other right-wing party, the RZS, said it would not sign the document because its EU partner, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECRG), objected to the participation of the ultra nationalist Ataka (Attack) party in the agreement. 
The proposed memorandum was designed to reiterate the unity and consolidation of the majority, as well as the right-wing parties' support for the future cabinet and the adoption of constitutional amendments.

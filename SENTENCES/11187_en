NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Secretary General's special representative on the rights of internally displaced persons, Walter Kalin, is urging the international community to pay special attention to the problems of internally displaced persons in Kosovo. 
In a special statement Friday (24 June), Kalin, who recently paid a trip to the region, described the situation as deplorable. 
He expressed concerns about low-level harassment, curtailed freedom of movement, lack of employment opportunities and a lack of funding.
In other news, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen and Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi held their regular meeting on Friday. 
They said they expect the bilateral Free Trade Agreement with neighbouring Macedonia to be finalised within 10 days.

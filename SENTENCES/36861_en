ANKARA, Turkey -- A second member of parliament from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) group has quit, according to a report Friday (9 July) by NTV. 
Atilla Basoglu, from the province of Adana, tendered his resignation Friday, a week after deputy Deniz Baykal did so. 
Local analysts note the moves broaden the gap between CHP and the ruling Justice and Development Party.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A year-old report by the National Security Agency, on the influence of criminal organisations within certain ministries and state agencies, caused a weekend scandal.
Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Saturday (October 24th) that he had received the report from Alexey Petrov, former commander of the special anti-terrorist police unit, who also used to advise Petko Sertov, the former director of the agency.
According to Borisov, the report, written a year ago, was labelled as the copy sent to the prime minister.
How it ended up with Petrov is unclear.
Under security protocols, all copies of confidential reports are to be returned to the security agency.
Borisov said he has ordered experts to first determine whether the report is genuine.
If so, this will put Borisov's predessor, Sergey Stanishev, chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, in direct violation of the law.
Borisov hinted that Stanishev was probably blackmailed by people mentioned in the report, which was why it didn't come back to the security agency.(BGNES, Darik, Novinar, bTV, Focus - 24/10/09)

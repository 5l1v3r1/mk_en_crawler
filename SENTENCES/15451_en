SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling criticised Republika Srpska (RS) authorities on Friday (26 May) for raising a new obstacle to the crucial police reform. 
He warned that the effort jeopardises BiH's progress in EU integration talks. 
He called a news conference after RS representatives effectively withdrew from the police restructuring process by downgrading their participation in the Police Reform Directorate Steering Board to that of observer status. 
They disagree with the draft model of the BiH police forces, which, among other things, would transfer legislative and budgeting responsibilities in the police sector from the entities to the state. 
RS also insists on changes in the Directorate's regulations, claiming that the current version violates the political agreement reached on police reform last year.

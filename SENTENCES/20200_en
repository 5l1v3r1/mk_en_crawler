SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government approved a decision Wednesday (February 13th) to shut down duty-free shops and petrol stations at border exit checkpoints. 
The decision, recommended by the European Commission (EC), is expected to be appealed by companies that manage the businesses, as the move violates their contracts with the state. 
The shops and stations were to be closed at the beginning of 2007 as part of Bulgaria's commitments to comply with EU legislation. 
The EC says such businesses are a major source of smuggling and local organised crime.
Also Wednesday, the government announced it will support a proposal by the Bulgarian Socialist Party to establish an energy holding company that is to include some of the largest state-owned companies in the sector. 
The new entity, called Bulgarian Energy Holding, will include Bulgargaz, the Kozloduy nuclear plant, the power utility NEK, the Maritca-Iztok II thermal power plant, and the Mini Maritca-Iztok mining complex. 
The government wants to create an entity that better competes with similar power companies in Europe.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva announced on Friday (16 September) that the European Commission (EC) set the first week of October as a deadline for parliament to pass the new penal code.
Kuneva added that the same deadline was given for the adoption of a new veterinary medicine law.
All other legislation related to Bulgaria's accession to the EU must be endorsed by the end of September, noted Kuneva, who voiced optimism that the terms would be met.

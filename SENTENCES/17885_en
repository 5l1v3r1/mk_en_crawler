TIRANA, Albania -- In an interview with Top-Channel on Thursday (May 17th), President Alfred Moisiu dismissed speculation that he is worn out after five years in office and hinted he would accept a second term. 
The president said he is closely watching the ongoing debates between the majority and the opposition on choosing a consensus president and pledged to announce his final decision when the time is right. 
"I will see how the circumstances will develop," said Moisiu. 
His mandate expires on July 24th.

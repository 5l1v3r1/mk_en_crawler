COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- EU leaders formally approved a 2004 review date for Turkey's candidacy, with a view to opening accession negotiations. 
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters Friday (13 December) the EU decision was not negotiable. 
"It has been concluded now that in December 2004, we will, on the basis of a Commission report, make an assessment of whether Turkey is meeting the Copenhagen criteria," he said referring to EU standards on democracy and human rights. 
Ankara had pressed for a firm date to open actual accession talks in 2003.
Summit members meanwhile are expected Friday afternoon to authorise detailed roadmaps and increased pre-accession funds to Bulgaria and Romania. 
Last week, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen made firm commitments, saying: "We need these countries if we want to achieve stability in the south-east of Europe."
In other news, parallel talks are underway in Copenhagen aimed at reunifying Cyprus. 
Hopes of a breakthrough after nearly three decades of division faded Thursday when health concerns prevented Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash from attending UN-led reconciliation talks. 
The EU gave Greek and Turkish Cypriots one more chance Friday to resolve their differences but insisted it would invite only the Greek Cypriot side into the Union if talks failed. 
Chances for a settlement were slim, said Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.

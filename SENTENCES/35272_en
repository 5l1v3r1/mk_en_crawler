ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey and Saudi Arabia have taken steps to improve their co-operation in fighting terrorism, Turkish media reported Thursday (22 April).
Agreement was reached during talks between Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal.
They met the day after a deadly suicide bomb in Riyadh killed at least four people and injured 148.
"Co-operation to fight off this evil will be to the benefit of all sides," the Saudi minister was quoted as saying.
Turkey was the target of deadly al-Qaeda attacks in November.
The international fight against terrorism was also the focus of talks Thursday between Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and his Australian counterpart, Robert Hill.
He travelled to Turkey for ceremonies marking the 89th anniversary of the Canakkale Battle of World War I. (Milliyet - 23/04/04;

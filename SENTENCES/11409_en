TIRANA, Albania -- A total of 54 political parties and coalitions have applied to run in the 3 July parliamentary elections, according to the Central Election Commission. 
The deadline for registering expired Tuesday (24 May). 
The applications will now be forwarded to the regional election bodies for verification.
Also Tuesday, the IMF and the World Bank criticised a recent decision by the Albanian cabinet to borrow 74.6m euros from the Dutch financial institution ABN Amro Holding to finance a railway project. 
The World Bank and the IMF warned the decision could have a negative impact on Albania's budget performance and investment capacity.

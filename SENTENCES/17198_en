SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Radmila Sekerinska, the leader of Macedonia's main opposition party, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, criticised the government Thursday (December 28th) for what it described as a slowdown in EU-related reform processes. 
In an interview with Radio Deutsche Welle, Sekerinska implied that the cabinet was responsible for Macedonia's failure to achieve a date for the launch of negotiations with the EU this year. 
She was particularly critical of the government's economic policy, stressing investors would not come to a country where taxation and social systems are changed every four years.

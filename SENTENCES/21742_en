SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Charles English rejected secessionist talk by Republika Srpska and stressed that any notion of separating BiH's two entities is "unacceptable and dangerous".
During a lecture on US foreign policy in BiH on Saturday (April19th), English also urged BiH politicians to start working and rise above petty party interests on EU integration.
BiH is to sign its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU this month or next.

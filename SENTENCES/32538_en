PAZARDZHIK, Bulgaria -- The National Security Service detained two suspected members of an Islamic group, the Caliphate, on Saturday (8 March). 
The men were allegedly propagandising in the Roma neighbourhood of Pazardzhik. 
District Prosecutor Rositza Terzova filed charges of spreading ideas dangerous to state security. 
The Caliphate group already has been banned in Turkey and Germany.
On Sunday meanwhile, the leftist opposition Socialist Party (BSP) demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Solomon Passy over his policy on Iraq. 
BSP leader Sergey Stanishev says the support expressed by Bulgaria's representative to the UN Security Council on the second draft resolution against Iraq differed from the official state position.
In other news, top Bulgarian businessman Ilia Pavlov was assassinated by a sniper Friday night in front of his office in Sofia. 
A Polish business magazine recently ranked him as the eighth richest man in Eastern and Central Europe, with assets valued at around $1.5 billion.

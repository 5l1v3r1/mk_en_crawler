MITROVICA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- One of Kosovo's Serb leaders, Oliver Ivanovic, noted Monday (14 October) that recent events indicate that Serbs would not take part in the local administration as equals. 
Thus, he says, Kosovo Serbs are not convinced that they should go to the polls in local elections on 26 October. 
He says the final decision will come after a meeting with UNMIK head Michael Steiner. 
France's Ambassador to Yugoslavia Gabriel Keller took the opposite view Monday, saying Kosovo Serbs have nothing to lose by participating in the elections.

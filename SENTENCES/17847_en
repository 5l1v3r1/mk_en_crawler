ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul confirmed on Thursday (July 19th) that Turkey has sent a note of protest to Austria for failing to apprehend a leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Riza Altun. 
He was allowed to fly to Iraq, though Austrian border police were aware that he was carrying a fake ID card and that an international arrest warrant had been issued for him by Interpol. 
"What they did is a heavy blow to international co-operation in the fight against terrorism," Gul was quoted as saying by NTV. 
In addition to demanding an official explanation from Austria, Gul said Turkey now expects Iraq to extradite Altun to Turkey.
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will visit Ankara shortly after Sunday's parliamentary elections, to discuss PKK bases in northern Iraq.

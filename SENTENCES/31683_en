BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic played down a statement Sunday (12 January) by his Montenegrin counterpart Milo Djukanovic, who predicted the republic would be independent in three years. 
Djindjic described the statement to parliament as political marketing, aimed at specific groups. 
He expressed the hope that the new federal state would last more than the three years stipulated in the new constitution as the minimum period before an independence referendum could be held.

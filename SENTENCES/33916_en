SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The World Bank warned BiH on Monday (10 November) that it would release a 108m euro loan only if the governments of the two entities maintain strict fiscal discipline. 
The institution's country manager for BiH said in a statement that financial assistance would be made available if the governments meet the challenge of reducing public spending and payrolls. 
The warning came after Republika Srpska bowed to pressure from labour unions and agreed to raise salaries in the public sector by 20 per cent.
In other news, an organisation representing Bosnian Serb prisoners of war says it is sending representatives to visit the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The Republika Srpska Association of Detainees says it has evidence of war crimes committed against Serb prisoners in Croat and Muslim camps during the 1992-1995 conflict.

ATHENS, Greece -- Special services and anti-terror police scrambled early Wednesday (April 25th), reportedly following a tip about a bomb threat against a hospital near the US Embassy in Athens.
Police blocked off and searched the area around the embassy after an Iraqi warned of a planned terror attack by six other Iraqis.
Though authorities raided several apartments in Athens and detained around 11 Iraqi immigrants for questioning, no evidence of a terror plot has surfaced.
Back in January, after a missile damaged the embassy, the leftist terrorist organisation Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility.
In other news, riot police are on alert amid continuing tensions at Greek prisons.
Inmates at three detention centres have been staging protests against poor conditions as well as against the alleged beating of an inmate by prison guards earlier this week.

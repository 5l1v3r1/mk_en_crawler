SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov met with his Polish counterpart, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, on Thursday (13 January) to discuss joint participation in the international peacekeeping mission in Iraq.
Poland recently decided to reduce its number of troops there;
Svinarov said his government would make a decision by March, allowing several weeks to pass after Iraq's 31 January elections.
Sofia will wait to see whether the new Iraqi government asks Bulgarian forces to stay on.

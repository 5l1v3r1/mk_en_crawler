SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The four largest opposition parties in BiH signed a co-operation agreement Sunday (23 November) aiming to pressure the ruling majority into calling early parliamentary elections next fall, to coincide with regular local elections.
Leaders of the Social Democratic Party, the Party of Independent Social Democrats, the New Croatian Initiative and the Socialist Party of Republika Srpska signed the document.
The new formation is viewed as a centre-left bloc established to counter the right-wing ruling coalition.
In other news, SFOR personnel and local police in BiH are stepping up security at administrative and diplomatic buildings, in the wake of the bombings in Istanbul.
The BiH Federation Interior Ministry announced the move in a press release Friday.

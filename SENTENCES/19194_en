ZAGREB, Croatia -- During a heated debate at the European Parliament on Tuesday (January 29th), Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel criticised Croatia about its introduction of a protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic.
Rupel accused Croatian authorities of virtually freezing diplomatic ties for the past six months and being unwilling to compromise.
In response, Croatia's foreign ministry said the government is in favour of bilateral negotiations.
It warned that statements such as Rupel's did not contribute to good neighbourly relations but would only damage the positive atmosphere needed to resolve current issues.

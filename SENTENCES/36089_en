ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul says the government believes the country will get a date for launching EU accession negotiations, as it has demonstrated its commitment to meeting the political criteria for EU membership. 
Speaking Friday (19 March), Gul noted that Turkish authorities have made progress with structural reforms and shown serious improvement in economic stability and development since the November 2002 general elections that propelled the current government into office.
Also Friday, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen said talks on Turkey's accession could start in the spring of 2005. 
The final decision will be made at the EU summit in December.

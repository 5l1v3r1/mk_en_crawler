BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Following his return from a two-day official visit to Brussels, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic declared Friday (8 November) that he received a clear message from officials: the EU will no longer tolerate delays in constitutional reforms. 
Referring to talks with EU security chief Javier Solana, EC President Romano Prodi and the European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten, Djinidjic said he was told it is Serbia and Montenegro's turn "to do the job". 
Serbia and Montenegro are expected to complete work on their new constitution and create common state bodies to negotiate with the EU on the country's stabilisation and association process.

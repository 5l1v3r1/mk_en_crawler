TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) will ask for a referendum on a law aimed at removing former communist officials from state institutions. 
The news follows the striking down by the Constitutional Court of an initial version of the so-called "lustration law". 
The law has been criticised outside of Albania by both the Helsinki Committee and the Venice Commission along with the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters. 
DP lawmaker Mesila Doda announced on Monday (February 1st) that a new bill will soon be introduced in parliament. 
Following approval there, she said, it will be put to a public referendum and sent to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg for input.

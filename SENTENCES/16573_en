BERLIN, Germany -- The German government has decided to keep its troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for one more year, but will reduce their number from 3,000 to 2,400. 
The cuts would reflect the normalisation of the situation in the Balkan country, a government spokesman said, noting also that the EU was considering substantial reductions in the number of troops serving with EUFOR. 
The decision by the German cabinet will have to be approved by parliament in Berlin.

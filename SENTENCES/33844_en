ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler on Wednesday (19 November) identified two Turkish men authorities believe carried out twin suicide attacks on synagogues, killing at least 25 people and wounding hundreds more.
"It has been verified with DNA testing that Mesut Cabuk was responsible for [the attack on] Beit Israel and Gokhan Elaltuntas was responsible for [the attack on] Neve Shalom," Guler told reporters.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has said the suspects probably had links to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist network, with possible ties to Afghanistan.
In other news, police stormed a courthouse in Istanbul on Tuesday to end a day-long siege by Kurdish protesters demanding the release of jailed Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan.
All 21 demonstrators were detained after a brief scuffle.

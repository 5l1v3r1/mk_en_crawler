SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative's Bulldozer Committee proposed 16 new sets of legislative reform Tuesday (30 September) aimed at strengthening the country's business climate. 
Supporters say the changes would contribute to harmonising legislation in the two entities and would reflect feedback from the business sector. 
The Bulldozer Committee works to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers and gather input from the private sector.
Also Tuesday, the BiH Council of Ministers approved the draft law for introduction of an indirect taxation system and forwarded the bill to parliament for adoption. 
The new regulations will unify value added tax rates and customs tariffs in the two entities as of January.

This year's jubilee Skopje Jazz Festival begins on Friday (20 October).
It offers jazz lovers a diverse programme, including performances by saxophonist Ornette Coleman and Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba at the Univerzalna Sala in Skopje, the traditional festival venue.
A novelty this year is introduction of another concert venue, the Hard Rock Club.
The programme also offers the Norwegian super band Wibute, American jazz vocalist Andy Bay, Benjamin Herman's quartet, the EST Esbjorn Swensson Trio, and many others.
"A quarter-century existence is a jubilee we want to mark with a programme that matches the 25th edition," said festival director Oliver Belopeta.
"We have kept Ornette Coleman for the jubilee and he will arrive from New York especially for the festival.
We take pride in being able to realise a powerful programme in all these years."
Belopeta acknowledges there are issues.
Among them is the condition of the Univerzalna Sala, which dates back to 1963 and is in very poor shape.
The top-billed guests mainly will be playing there, while other performers will be featured at the Hard Rock.
The newly opened club also is hosting Thursday's performance by DJ duo Jihan and Kaminen.
In addition, some events will take place at other venues such as the Medium Club and the Mala Stanica Cultural Centre.
These include guitarist Georgi Sarevski's quartet, guitarist Toni Kitanovski's trio, and others.
Marking the jubilee, an exhibition of photographs and posters spanning the 25-year history of the festival is opening at the Museum of the City of Skopje.

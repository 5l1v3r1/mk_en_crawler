BUCHAREST, Romania -- The IMF expects Romania to take all measures to prevent the enforcement of a cut in income tax approved by the senate on Tuesday (November 23rd), Jeffrey Franks, chief of the Fund's mission to Romania, warned Wednesday.
Franks said that the cut of the tax from 16% to 10% raises concerns over the achievement of next year's 4.4% of GDP deficit target -- a condition for the disbursement of the next instalments from the country's stand-by loan with the Fund.
Franks emphasised that the flat tax reduction does not comply with the medium-term fiscal strategy the cabinet agreed on with the IMF.
Romania is under a 20b-euro stand-by agreement with the IMF, European Commission and the World Bank.
The sixth review mission of the IMF took place in October and was followed by a delay of the next tranche disbursement from December to January next year, as the cabinet has to accomplish several preconditions.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament voted 211 to 84 on Thursday (1 April) to adopt a report which praises the Turkish government for its reform efforts but warns that Ankara has still not met EU standards of law, human rights, and democracy. 
Problem areas are the torture and the prosecution of torturers, political persecution, widespread violence against women, and absence of gender-based equality. 
The European MPs also took Ankara to task over restrictions on freedom of expression and the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities. 
The European Parliament, however, rejected a proposal by a number of conservative lawmakers who want Turkey to be given the status of "privileged partnership" rather than full membership.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia belongs to Europe and it is in the EU's interest to start accession talks with the country as soon as possible, Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said on Thursday (May 12th) after meeting with counterpart Nikola Gruevski in Skopje. 
Orban, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, noted that Macedonia has had candidate status for six years, adding an "unnatural" reason stands in the way, a reference to the long-standing name dispute between Skopje and Athens. 
"It's not my job to take a position on Macedonia's relations with another country, but my job is to represent the interests of Europe," Orban said.

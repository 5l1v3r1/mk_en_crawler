SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Domestic and European leaders voiced deep regret on Wednesday (July 11th) over the Libyan Supreme Court's decision to uphold death sentences handed down to five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, and urged a political solution to the case.
The court's ruling ended an eight-year court battle involving the medics, who were convicted of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV at a Benghazi hospital, despite evidence to the contrary.
The medics' fate now lies with the Libyan High Judicial Council, which is due to meet next week.
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said Wednesday's ruling came as no surprise, given the course of the trial thus far.
Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Terry Davis and the Parliamentary Assembly of CoE President Rene van der Linden condemned the ruling, which van der Linden said represented "blatant denial of justice resulting from unfair trial procedures".
Davis called on the Libyan Council to reconsider the decision.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Porttering, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini and EU Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner also voiced concern.

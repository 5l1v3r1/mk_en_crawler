ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Social Democratic Party on Tuesday (24 February) criticised the Catholic Church for conducting "sexual education during catechism classes in . 
a completely inappropriate way". 
In an open letter to the minister of education, the Social Democrats claimed that a film about abortions shown to high school students was too graphic in nature and traumatised the children. 
"If the same logic applied, we should show the dead bodies of drug addicts to pupils to teach them about dangers of drug consumption," said children's ombudsman Ljubica Matijevic-Vrsaljko.

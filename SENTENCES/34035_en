ROME, Italy -- Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano promised European leaders on Monday (28 July) that his country would push ahead with the economic and social reforms necessary to bring it closer to EU membership.
In response, the so-called EU troika -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, his Irish counterpart Brian Cowen and European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten -- expressed strong support for Albania's membership-related efforts.
The meeting in Rome took place within the framework of Italy's EU presidency.
Ireland will take over the rotating presidency at the end of the year.
In other news, the Albanian Parliament rejected the nomination of Marko Bello, Nano's choice to replace Ilir Meta as foreign minister.
Meta resigned from the post last week.
Lawmakers did, however, approve Ermelinda Meksi as minister of state for integration.
She replaces Sokol Nako, who also resigned.

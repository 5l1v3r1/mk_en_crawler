BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (December 11th) to partially suspend negotiations with Turkey and to monitor Ankara's progress in ending trade restrictions on Cyprus. 
If the decision is confirmed at the EU summit later this week, the accession talks on eight of the 35 negotiating chapters will be put on hold until Ankara has opened its seaports and airfields to Cypriot traffic. 
"We don't want to set any ultimatums or deadlines, nor impose sanctions," Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik said summarising the EU's decision. 
"The EU has proved its patience but also steadfastness in its policies," she added. 
Turkey has said that it would end restrictions on Cyprus when the EU resumes trade with the Turkish Cypriots. 
"The EU decision is an injustice against Turkey," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament on Tuesday, adding that EU-Turkey relations now face a "serious test".

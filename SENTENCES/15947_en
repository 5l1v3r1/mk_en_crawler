SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The High Judicial Council Wednesday (October 18th) fired two prosecutors who have been charged with abuse of office and the deliberate delay of criminal proceedings.
The two -- Zdravko Yordanov of the Supreme Cassation Prosecution and Lom Regional Prosecutor Veronika Kolyova -- were sacked following an internal investigation ordered by Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev.
It found they had hindered work on cases for years.
Kolyova, for example, blocked 1,422 prosecutorial procedures from 1989-1996.
She faces up to eight years in prison.

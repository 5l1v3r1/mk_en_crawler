ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan reportedly has called a meeting with top opposition parties to discuss the indictment of Gen Janko Bobetko by the UN war crimes tribunal. 
An anonymous source in the cabinet says the meeting will be held by month's end. 
The major opposition parties insist that the 83-year-old Bobetko should not be handed over, while the cabinet refuses to extradite him on the grounds that his health is too fragile.

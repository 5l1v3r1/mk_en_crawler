BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romanian officials will start negotiations with the European Commission in Brussels Thursday (19 February), to close the chapter on competition policy.
The country has closed 22 of 30 policy chapters so far, hoping to finalise the negotiation process by the end of the year.
This will allow Romania to sign the EU accession treaty next year and to join the Union in January 2007, together with Bulgaria.
Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, will lead the delegation in the upcoming talks and plans to meet separately with senior Union officials.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Presidency Members Zeljko Komsic and Haris Silajdzic said on Friday (November 23rd) that the archive of The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) should be stored in Sarajevo. 
However, the Serb member of the presidency, Nebojsa Radmanovic, said the documentation should not be kept on the territory of the former Yugoslavia because of possible abuse. 
The future of the ICTY archive was discussed at a meeting between BiH's presidency and judicial co-ordinators at the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in advance of the ICTY's closure in 2010.

TIRANA, Albania -- The EU expressed concern Wednesday (January 28th) about the law passed late last month that opens the files of the communist-era secret police in Albania. 
In a communiquÃ© from its embassy in Tirana, the Czech Republic, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, said the biggest concern is procedural issues. 
Furthermore, it said the EU wants to meet with Albanian leaders to discuss the matter. 
The measure on opening the secret files, known as the "lustration law", envisions the dismissal of all public officials who co-operated with the secret police during the 1944-1990 communist regime. 
It passed with the votes of the ruling Democratic Party. 
The opposition, led by the Socialist Party, boycotted the vote and accused Prime Minister Sali Berisha of attempting to use the law to remove some judiciary officials working on corruption cases.

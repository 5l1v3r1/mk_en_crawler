BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik dismissed on Sunday (30 July) accusations by BiH presidency member Sulejman Tihic that the sealing of an accord to build a new bridge across the Sava River violated the BiH Constitution. 
Tihic has criticised the agreement on the grounds that it was drafted without the approval of central BiH authorities. 
But Dodik, who signed the deal last week with Serbian counterpart Vojislav Kostunica, says the RS government sought and received approval from the BiH Ministry of Transport and Communications.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament passed a new media law Tuesday (February 15th), allowing broadcasts in foreign languages and dialects, as well as a 50% ceiling for foreign capital share in media institutions.
Foreign individuals or corporations can become direct partners of no more than two media institutions.
The new law also includes unprecedented and controversial provisions, granting the prime minister or a prime minister-delegated minister the right to suspend media activity as and when necessitated by national security or public order.
In other news Tuesday, police clashed with Kurdish protesters in 12 cities across the country during rallies to mark the 12th anniversary of the arrest of Kurdistan Workers' Party leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Demonstrators threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons.
At least 30 people were arrested.

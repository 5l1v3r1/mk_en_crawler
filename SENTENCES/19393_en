SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government marked its first year in office Sunday (August 26th), assessing its successes and failures so far.
Parties in the ruling coalition cited increased salaries in the public administration sector, lower taxes and progress in fighting corruption and organised crime.
The opposition, in turn, pointed to stagnation in political dialogue, unfinished judicial reforms and lack of transparency in the use of state money for media campaigns.
The cabinet has three more years in office.

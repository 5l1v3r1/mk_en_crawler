BUCHAREST, Romania -- Hungarian Foreign Minister Kinga Goncz issued a statement Thursday (June 14th) expressing concern over the criminal investigations opened against some members of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, including one against Telecommunications Minister Zsolt Nagy.
Goncz insists the political involvement of the Hungarian minority on a national level should not be jeopardised by short-term tactical political moves.
President Traian Basescu suspended Nagy earlier this week after prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into his alleged efforts on behalf of a crime group in connection with the privatisation process.
Prime Minister Calin Popesci Tariceanu told reporters that he was surprised by Hungary's reaction.
He suggested the matter could have been handled through diplomatic channels.

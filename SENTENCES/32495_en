SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An international audit conducted at BiH Elektroprivreda Sarajevo uncovered irregularities that have resulted in significant losses for the company, though not on the scale found at two other Elektroprivreda enterprises in BiH.
The Office of the High Representative presented the findings at a news conference Thursday (13 March).
Officials say irregularities included overly expensive investment projects, such as the construction of a new headquarters building in Sarajevo, as well as use of money for inappropriate purposes.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown says that since audits at all three power utilities in BiH uncovered irregularities, audits may be conducted at other public enterprises as well.

PARIS, France -- The two leading candidates for president of France vowed on Thursday (April 26th) to try to persuade Libya to free five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.
A Libyan court sentenced them to death last December on internationally disputed charges of infecting children at a Benghazi hospital with HIV.
"If I am elected president â¦ I will make the release of these women and this man a priority," conservative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy told relatives of the nurses.
Segolene Royal, the Socialist candidate, said she would push the EU to do more to free the nurses.
Both candidates indicated the plight of the nurses is key to their drive to promote human rights.
In other news, German Ambassador to Bulgaria Michael Geier said in an interview published on Thursday that the European Commission and the authorities in Tripoli could reach an agreement to free the nurses by the end of June.
That is when Germany's turn as chairman of the rotating EU presidency ends.

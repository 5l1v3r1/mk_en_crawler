SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH House of Representatives rejected a motion Tuesday (October 30th) filed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the dismissal of Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj. 
The SDP cited his dual citizenship, BiH and Croatian, a fact he purportedly hid when he was appointed foreign minister. 
The SDP said it had hoped to trigger a broader cabinet reshuffle.

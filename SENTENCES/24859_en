BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government backed President Boris Tadic on Thursday (July 2nd), agreeing that minority Serbs in Kosovo should not participate in November local elections there. 
Tadic, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DS), says conditions for Kosovo Serbs are inadequate and that their security cannot be guaranteed.
At a meeting Thursday, the Serbian cabinet concluded that the November elections will not be organised in line with UN Security Council resolution 1244, which puts Kosovo under UN control. 
The only dissent in Belgrade came from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, a former faction within the DS. 
Party leader Cedomir Jovanovic says Belgrade should not have urged Kosovo Serbs to boycott the vote.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government reported Monday (30 June) that GDP rose by 8.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2003, signaling an emergence from the severe financial crisis that developed in 2001. 
The government's target for overall GDP growth is 5 per cent this year.
In other news Monday, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said the government is looking for ways to cut 100,000 out of 440,000 vacant jobs in the state sector. 
The openings, which are kept as reserve vacancies by the various ministries, have been the target of criticism since they have allegedly been used by ministers to dole out political favours.

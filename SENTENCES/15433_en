BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors have indicted two former police officers in connection with the murder of three US citizens of ethnic Albanian descent. 
According to the indictments, Sreten Popovic and Milos Stojanovic picked up brothers Yili, Mehmet and Agron Bytyqi upon their release from a Serbian jail and handed them over to other officers, who then executed them. 
The brothers had returned to Kosovo from New York to fight with the Kosovo Liberation Army in 1999. 
Shortly after the end of the conflict, in July 1999, they crossed the border into Serbia, allegedly to visit their mother in the village of Merdare.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A delegation of Macedonian officials, led by Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski, met with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Brussels on Thursday (28 October). 
Buckovski and de Hoop Scheffer discussed the 7 November referendum on decentralisation, with the NATO chief stressing that implementation of the law on territorial organisation is a cornerstone of the Ohrid Framework Agreement and is therefore essential for Macedonia's stability. 
They also discussed progress in defence reforms, co-operation among the Adriatic Charter countries working towards NATO integration, and Macedonia's participation in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

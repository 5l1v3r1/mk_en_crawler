TIRANA, Albania -- The wife of crown heir Leka Zog died Saturday (17 July) from a heart condition.
She was 63.
"Her Majesty Susan I Zog is no longer with us," a spokesman for the Albanian royal family said in a short statement.
Originally from Australia, Susan Barbara Cullen-Ward married Leka in Biarritz in October 1975.
The couple has one son.
Leka was born a few days after Italy occupied Albania at the start of World War II, and lived in exile until the collapse of communism in 1990.
In 1997, he lost a referendum on restoring the monarchy and left the country, but returned again to launch a political movement that aims to take part in next year's general elections.

ATHENS, Greece -- Exit polls suggest the ruling New Democracy (ND) party won the largest number of votes in Sunday's (13 June) elections for members of the European Parliament.
ND won 42.6 per cent of the vote, which translates into 10 or 11 EP seats.
The opposition PASOK party got 34.3 per cent and 8 or 9 seats.
The Communist Party was third, with 9.5 per cent of the votes and 2 or 3 seats.
The Coalition of the Left and Popular Orthodox Rally are also close to the 5 per cent EP entry threshold and will probably have one representative each.
Voter turnout was about 62 per cent.

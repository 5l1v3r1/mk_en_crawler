NEW YORK, United States -- The chief UN mediator in the talks on Kosovo's status has been asked by the international Contact Group to draft a solution on the future of the Serbian province, a UN spokesman said Monday (18 September). 
Martti Ahtisaari was due on Tuesday to meet with representatives of the group, which consists of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States. 
The Contact Group wants direct talks between Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians to be completed by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, UNMIK's new chief Joachim Ruecker said in an interview for a German newspaper that his main task would be to prevent the secession of Serb-populated areas from Kosovo. 
The UN mission, he said, is determined to avert any such development.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- UNMIK and the Serbian government failed to reach agreement on the decentralisation of Kosovo on Wednesday (30 October) during a meeting between UNMIK chief Michael Steiner and Serbia's Co-ordinator for Kosovo and South Serbia, Nebojsa Covic.
Steiner once again presented his seven-point plan on gradual decentralisation of the province.
Kosovo Serbs say the plan cannot guarantee their security from attacks by extremist groups.

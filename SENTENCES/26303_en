NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A memorial service was held on Saturday (December 12th) on the first anniversary of the death of late Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos.
On Friday, thieves stole Papadopoulos's remains from his grave at Deftera Cemetery, on the outskirts of Nicosia.
Police said they had questioned three people in relation to the macabre theft, but had made no arrests.
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the crime, and motives remain unclear.
Papadopoulos's family called the robbing a "horrifying act that has caused pain and anger".
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias urged people to "remain calm in light of this provocation".

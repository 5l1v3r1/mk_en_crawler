BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The deputy head of the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Enlargement, Jan Truszczynski, said on Tuesday (November 25th) that chances of capturing war crimes fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic are "pretty high", given efforts by Serbia in the past six months. 
Speaking at a conference on the legacy of The Hague war crimes tribunal in Brussels, Truszczynski said he based his assessment on recent reports obtained by the EC from the government in Serbia. 
Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz sends his report about co-operation to the UN Security Council on December 10th.

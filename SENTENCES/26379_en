BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) called on the European Commission (EC) to start a visa liberalisation process with Kosovo, similar to other countries in the region, and asked for a roadmap that would lead to facilitation of visas, followed by full liberalisation.
Tanja Fajon, EP rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, said on Thursday (November 12th) that Kosovo should not be left out of the visa process "because Kosovo cannot be a black hole in the region".
EP members supported the proposal on visa liberalisation for Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia effective on December 19th.
They say Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be included in the visa liberalisation process by mid-2010.

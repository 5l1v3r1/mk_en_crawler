ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday (10 April) urged more restraint by police and more respect for civil rights in police actions. 
In a speech marking the 160th anniversary of the Turkish police institution's establishment, Erdogan stressed that the country is the focus of EU attention ahead of the scheduled start of membership negotiations on 3 October. 
He urged members of the security forces and members of the public to contribute to the peace and stability of Turkey.
Last week, the chief inspector of Turkish police, Emin Ozdemir, wrote in a press article that police were not showing objectivity during rallies and demonstrations. 
The article summarised the results of a survey Ozdemir had conducted.

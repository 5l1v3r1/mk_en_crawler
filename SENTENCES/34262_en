ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Wednesday (2 July) that Turkey's 7th EU legal harmonisation package is close to completion. 
The package reportedly includes an article stipulating that the secretary general of the National Security Council be a civilian, appointed directly by the prime minister. 
A draft was submitted to the military earlier this week. 
The EU has said it wants the military to play less of a role in government.
In other news, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan returned Thursday from a trip to Lisbon, saying Portugal has pledged its full support for Turkey's EU membership bid. 
He added that convincing the Union to open accession talks by the end of 2004 is one of Turkey's chief foreign policy goals.

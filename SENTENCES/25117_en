PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The city council plans to meet on September 14th to discuss an initiative to remove Mayor Miomir Mugosa from office, caucus leaders decided on Wednesday (August 26th). 
The opposition filed a no confidence motion against Mugosa after two journalists with the Podgorica-based daily Vijesti claimed they were assaulted by the mayor, his son and their guard after the journalists snapped photos of their illegally parked cars. 
Mugosa says he acted in self-defence.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- Romania has supplied military equipment to Iraq and Cote d'Ivoire over the past few years, Amnesty International said in a report Thursday (September 18th). 
The document, which criticises the "poorly regulated" situation in global arms trading, claims Romania has sold four attack helicopters to Cote d'Ivoire. 
Other countries exporting arms to controversial states included Belarus, Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine, the London-based organisation said. 
Amnesty International has urged world leaders to adopt a rule banning countries from exporting weapons to countries where there is a risk they will help governments commit serious violations of internationally recognised human rights.

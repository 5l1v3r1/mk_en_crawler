SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Tsvetlin Yovchev will head the State Agency for National Security, replacing Petko Sertov, who resigned at the weekend, new Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's government announced on Wednesday (August 5th). 
Sertov was the first director of the agency, which was created to incorporate a number of security services in an attempt to achieve better results against organised crime and corruption. 
Yovchev has previously headed the counter intelligence department at the agency, and has worked in the field since 1993. 
The new government intends to restructure the agency, transferring some of its powers to the interior ministry.

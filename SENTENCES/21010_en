SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Officials signed an agreement in Sofia on Monday (September 3rd) to transfer Libya's $56.6m debt to Bulgaria into an international fund established to help 400 children infected with HIV at a Benghazi hospital. 
Foreign Minister Feim Chaushev, who signed the document, said Bulgaria was standing by its promise to help Libya's HIV victims.
The decision comes six weeks after Libya agreed to free five Bulgarian nurses and a doctor sentenced to death for allegedly infecting the children. 
Bulgaria says the decision is a humanitarian act that in no way admits the medics' guilt. 
Libya stopped repaying the $20m debt to Bulgaria in 1984 and up to recently refused to recognise the accumulated $30.6m interest.

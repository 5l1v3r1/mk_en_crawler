ATHENS, Greece -- Somali pirates freed on Thursday (December 10th) a Greek-owned ship and its 24-member Ukrainian crew after receiving a ransom of more than $2.5m.
The Ariana cargo ship was captured in early May southwest of the Seychelles, en route from Brazil to the Middle East.
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko confirms that the sailors have been released.
Spyros Minas, director of the Athens-based All Ocean Shipping Company, which owns the ship, acknowledged a ransom was paid but refused to specify the amount.

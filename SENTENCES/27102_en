PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serb representatives from northern Kosovo are objecting to the new strategy drafted by the government and the International Civilian Office (ICO) for that part of Kosovo.
Representatives of Serbian political parties and the Serbian Orthodox Church met on Thursday (February 4th) in Mitrovica.
One participant -- Marko Jaksic -- called on Mitrovica Serbs to block any plan to integrate the Serb-dominated area into greater Kosovo.
Serbs in the country have relied on Belgrade-backed parallel structures in the north.
Meeting participants also criticised Serbian President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic for their policies towards the Serb community.
Dragan Todorovic of the Serbian Radical Party also called on Belgrade to stop welcoming EULEX.
The Kosovo government maintains that most Serbs in the north are interested in the rule of law, democracy and economic development.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Environment Minister Osman Pepe has confirmed that barrels containing highly poisonous waste were found in the Tuzla area near Istanbul, according to local media reports Wednesday (26 April).
Members of parliament asked about it Tuesday evening, in response to recent press reports alleging that a local pharmaceutical company, Unifar, had been dumping toxic waste in the outskirts of Istanbul.
The area has been sealed off, and inspections are under way to determine if soil or underground water supplies have been contaminated.

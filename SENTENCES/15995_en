ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday (20 May) called for redoubling efforts to strengthen democracy and the secular system in the wake of a deadly attack on Turkey's top administrative court, in which a senior judge was killed and four others wounded.
At the same time, he criticised Turkish Chief of General Staff Hilmi Ozkok for praising Thursday's demonstrations in Ankara, during which tens of thousands took to the street to protest the attack and defend secularism in Turkey.
"Expecting the continuation of such reactions and giving advice on that is not the right approach".
We should make efforts to strengthen calm, peace and unity," Erdogan said.
Meanwhile, local media are reporting the arrest of a man thought to have orchestrated the court shooting.
He was identified as Muzaffer Tekin, a former military officer who belongs to an organisation calling itself The Patriotic Force Action Team.
The gunman, 29-year-old Istanbul lawyer Alparslan Arslan, was a member of the same group.
Another eight people associated with the group are being questioned.
Tekin was last reported in hospital receiving treatment for a self-inflicted wound to the chest.
His condition was described as good.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government of Republika Srpska admitted for the first time on Friday (11 June) that Bosnian Serb troops had murdered several thousand Muslims in Srebrenica in July 1995. 
A government-appointed commission also said in its report that the perpetrators had tried to hide evidence of the atrocity by moving the victims' bodies to other locations. 
This represents "a grave violation of international humanitarian law," the commission said. 
The 42-page document notes that most of the information was provided by Bosnian Serb sources. 
Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, said the report and recent statements by politicians "may indicate a growing willingness to face up to the issue of responsibility for Srebrenica and to achieve justice for the victims."
In other news Friday, BiH and the United States signed an agreement on military co-operation. 
Sarajevo will get nearly $15m in logistical support and training for the armies of both entities. 
Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic also announced that he would be travelling to Washington for meetings and would invite the United States to set up a military base in BiH.

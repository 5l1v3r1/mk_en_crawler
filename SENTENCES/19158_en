MOSCOW, Russia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku was in Moscow on Thursday (30 November) to discuss the province's future. 
He met with Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov and the president of the foreign policy committee of the Russian parliament, Konstantin Kosacov. 
Ceku urged Russia not to use its veto power at the UN Security Council when the proposal for Kosovo's status is presented for approval. 
He promised that a package of measures would be adopted in Pristina to guarantee the rights of all minorities. 
At the same time, he stressed that the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo is determined to achieve independence from Serbia.
Titov, however, said Russia would recognise an independent Kosovo only after Belgrade does. 
After the meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement urging Serbs and ethnic Albanians to reach a negotiated settlement.

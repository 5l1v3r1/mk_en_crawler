BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- A senior member of the ruling DOS coalition told the media Wednesday (13 November) that the 17-party bloc would support Vojislav Kostunica for president of Serbia.
Velimir Ilic says DOS officials were to meet the current Yugoslav president on Thursday to discuss Kostunica's candidacy.
He added that DOS would nominate Dragoljub Micunovic if Kostunica decides not to run in next month's election.

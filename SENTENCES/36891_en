BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government is expected to present the final report on the action plan for EU accession in Brussels on Friday (9 July). 
The document details implementation of measures included in the action plan as of the end of June. 
Bucharest adopted the plan in February, following criticism from the Union about delays in reforms.
In other news, Romanian automaker Dacia posted record sales during the first half of 2004 -- a 34 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. 
The company credited the jump in sales to the success of its compact model Solenza and a strong increase in exports.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The presidency and the government say they will continue to refuse any talks with Belgrade until Serbia recognises Kosovo's institutions.
"There can be talks -- as with any other sovereign state -- only about good neighbouring relations and the liberalisation of the borders and trade," presidential spokesperson Xhavit Beqiri said on Thursday (January 8th).
Government spokesperson Memli Krasniqi said on Wednesday that no talks on technical issues have been planned, adding that any such talks can take place only when Serbia recognises Kosovo as an equal partner.
Recent media reports quoted UNMIK spokesman Russell Geekie as saying that UNMIK has a timetable of technical-issues meetings between experts in January.
In other news, Pope Benedict XVI expressed his hope for peace and reconciliation between the peoples of Kosovo and Serbia in an address to members of the diplomatic corps in the Vatican, RTK reported on Thursday.
In other news Thursday, Albania and Kosovo said they plan to sign an agreement for a "mini-Schengen" between the two countries to provide citizens with free movement.
Albanian President Bamir Topi kicked off a visit to Pristina, saying that with the commitment of Kosovo authorities and the co-operation of EULEX, the United States and KFOR, there will be no tolerance for violent incidents, which have been spreading fear in Mitrovica.
Topi called for respect for the rights of all minorities in the region, including the minorities in the Presevo Valley of Serbia.

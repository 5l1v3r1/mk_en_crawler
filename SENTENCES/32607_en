ANKARA, Turkey -- Stocks tumbled more than 10 per cent on Monday (3 March) and the lira slid after Saturday's dramatic parliament vote refusing permission for the United States to deploy troops in preparation for a possible operation against Iraq.
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul moved to limit the impact on markets, holding an early news conference in which he announced measures to keep the country within a vital IMF-backed $16 billion crisis recovery plan. 
Markets, however, immediately reacted to the implications for a financial aid package of up to $30 billion which Washington had been prepared to offer Turkey.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell called Gul on Sunday to reassure him that ties between the two countries would remain strong. 
According to Gul's office, the two leaders agreed to keep communications open.

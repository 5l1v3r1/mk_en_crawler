PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said on Thursday (February 7th) that the EU is expected to make a final decision on the future status of Kosovo immediately after Serbia completes its electoral process.
After a government meeting Thursday, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said only a few details are left to be decided before independence is declared and that Pristina, Washington and Brussels are in the last phase of finalising the process. 
AFP is reporting it will happen within ten days, just ahead of the EU foreign ministers meeting on February 18th.

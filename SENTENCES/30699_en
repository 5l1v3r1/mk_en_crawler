DAMASCUS, Syria -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Wednesday (April 6th), wrapping up a two-day round of visits in the Middle East region. 
During the meeting with Assad, Davutoglu expressed Ankara's support for reforms in Syria and offered to help boost the security and stability of its people. 
Assad assured him Syria is open to benefitting from the experience of other countries' reforms. 
The first stop of Davutoglu's tour was in Manama, Bahrain on Tuesday morning for talks with counterpart Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa and representatives of various political groups. 
Davutoglu was supposed to travel directly to Damascus, but instead made a stop in Doha, Qatar late Tuesday, where he met with Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jebril about Turkey's involvement in NATO-led operations in the African country. 
They also discussed prospects for a cease fire in Libya.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- OSCE Ambassador to Pristina Pascal Fieschi met with Kosovo's new Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi on Tuesday (29 March) and agreed to continue the level of co-operation established so far between the OSCE mission and the provisional government. 
According to an OSCE statement, Fieschi believes Kosumi's election will be a positive step towards guaranteeing a secure future for Kosovo and its communities.
Also Tuesday, US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said discussions about Kosovo's status would have a better chance of succeeding if all European states participated in the talks and approached the province as a future EU member. 
He made the remark in Slovenia, the first stop in a several-day tour of the region.

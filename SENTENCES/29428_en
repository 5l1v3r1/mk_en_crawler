BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic announced on Saturday (May 1st) that lawmakers will be discussing a declaration Wednesday condemning war crimes committed against Serbs during the 1990s.
Lawmakers will then have ten days to submit objections or proposals.
The draft condemns crimes against Serbian citizens and all people of the Serb nationality committed during the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia and the 1999 NATO-led bombings.
Lawmakers have urged regional parliaments to adopt similar documents, and on March 31st, passed a declaration condemning atrocities committed in Srebrenica.

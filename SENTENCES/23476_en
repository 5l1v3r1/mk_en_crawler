SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Sarajevo-based court sentenced former commander of Bosnian Muslim forces in Srebrenica, Naser Oric, to two years in prison for illegal arms possession Wednesday (June 24th).
He was acquitted of extortion charges.
Both the defence and prosecution said they were not satisfied with the sentence and vowed to appeal.
Last July, The Hague tribunal acquitted Oric of committing war crimes against Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.

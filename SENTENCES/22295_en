BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than 150 truckers blocked the ring road around Bucharest with their vehicles Tuesday evening (May 13th). 
The drivers are threatening to block traffic in downtown Bucharest if their demands to remove road tolls go unmet. 
They also want more transparency in the collection of fuel fees and an upgrade of rest areas. 
Both Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu and Transport Minister Ludovic Orban refuse to discuss their demands. 
Tuesday's protest came on the heels of a similar action the day before. 
A month ago, the haulers staged a series of protests in Bucharest and 18 other cities across the country. 
Those were against a government measure to collect two sets of tolls -- one for national roads and one for highways. 
The truckers say Romania is the only EU member that collects the fee twice.

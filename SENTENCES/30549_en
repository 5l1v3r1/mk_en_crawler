SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Data released on Tuesday (December 14th) suggests that nearly half of Bulgaria's current ambassadors and consuls abroad served as informers for the communist-era secret services. 
The committee overseeing these records published on the internet the names of 192 senior diplomats who collaborated with the secret services before the fall of communism in 1989. 
Among them are Bulgaria's current ambassadors to several EU countries, including Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain and Portugal, as well as to some neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Greece and Romania. 
Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov, who is expected to return from Brussels on Wednesday, has not yet issued an official reaction.

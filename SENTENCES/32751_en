PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- A bomb exploded on Bill Clinton Avenue in downtown Pristina late Friday (13 December), injuring more than 30 people, seven of them seriously.
Barry Fletcher, spokesman for the UN police, called the attack a terrorist act.
All of the victims were Albanians.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, visiting those in hospital, said "something like this always happens ahead of some important visit to Kosovo".
Bomb blasts at Orthodox churches preceded UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's visit last month.
On Saturday, a UN Security Council fact-finding mission arrived in Pristina to meet with local officials and visit the ethnically divided town of Kosovska Mitrovica.
The diplomats are to travel to Belgrade on Monday.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Only close co-operation with NATO could protect the Serbian population in Kosovo and find a solution for the province, according to Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus.
"Co-operation with NATO .
is the only guarantee for the protection of Serbs in Kosovo," he said Sunday (28 March).
He called for continued efforts towards a multiethnic Kosovo.
In other news, EU spokesman Kris Pierre Litiere said Saturday that the outbreak of violence in Kosovo earlier this month damaged the province's fragile economy.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- In a radio interview Thursday (22 January) Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi said he does not support the multiethnicity idea being promoted by the international community.
However, he also spoke in favour of different ethnic minorities in the province living together rather than being separated on ethnic principles.
"I do ask the people of Kosovo, even if we don't like one another, and we don't have to, to respect one another, to refrain from attacks, to make it possible for everyone, as human beings, to have their place in Kosovo, and for fundamental rights to be respected." Rexhepi said.

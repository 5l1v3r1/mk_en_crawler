THESSALONIKI, Greece -- The course and speed of the Balkan states' integration into the EU depends on fulfilling their commitments under the association agreements they have signed, according to Alexandros Mallias, the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry's Balkan Affairs Department.
Mallias spoke Wednesday (28 May) at a press conference in Thessaloniki.
He said the Union would give priority to efforts made by countries combating organised crime and human trafficking while facilitating refugee returns and social cohesion.

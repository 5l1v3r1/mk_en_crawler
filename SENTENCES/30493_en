ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government on Friday (April 8th) denied it is responsible for the cancelation of a planned visit by a Russian delegation led by Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko. 
Local media reported that the visit was scrubbed because no government official was willing to receive Shmatko and his delegation. 
But the government says it received less than a day's notice of the trip, giving planners no time to prepare an adequate schedule. 
The visit was supposed to focus on joint energy projects.

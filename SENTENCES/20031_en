ANKARA, Turkey -- Two men hijacked a plane on a flight from Northern Cyprus to Istanbul but gave themselves up after the pilots landed the aircraft in Antalya for refuelling on Saturday (August 18th).
According to law enforcement officials, one of the men tried to force his way into the cockpit, telling passengers and crew that he was a member of al-Qaeda and had a bomb.
The hijackers wanted to be flown to Tehran but pilots landed at Antalya because they did not have enough fuel.
As soon as the aircraft touched down, 136 passengers and the pilots rushed out of the plane using emergency exits.
The two suspects managed to detain four passengers and two cabin crew while they negotiated with authorities.
Police identified the hijackers as Mehmet Resat Ozlu, a Turkish citizen, and Mommen Abdul Aziz Talikh, a Palestinian with a Syrian passport.

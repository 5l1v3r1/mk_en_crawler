PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Montenegrin community will be added to the list of minority communities in Kosovo and will be legally recognised and equal to other minorities there, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci confirmed on Wednesday (April 28th), during a regular cabinet meeting. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu has requested the government start the necessary amendment to the law on community rights. 
Including the Montenegrin community in Kosovo's Constitution is supported by all ministers except for Serb Minister for Labour and Social Welfare Nenad Rasic, who says no more than 100 Montenegrins live in Kosovo.

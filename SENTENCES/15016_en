ATHENS, Greece -- Significant progress has been made in terms of judicial reforms, but much remains to be done, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said after visiting the justice ministry. 
The main objectives of reforms are to improve quality, speed up processes and strengthen independence, he said, pledging that all cases of corruption would be investigated. 
Infrastructure would be boosted as well, with the construction of new prisons and courts, and the upgrade of information systems in courts.

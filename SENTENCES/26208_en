SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Justice Minister Margarita Popova and Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov are calling for reform of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), the most senior decision-making body in the judicial system, local media reported on Wednesday (March 17th).
They particularly oppose the political quota system in the SJC, as 11 of its members are elected by parliament, which the ministers say provides a protective umbrella for organised crime figures.
Tsvetanov also says there are too many judges, 25 of them, for a country the size of Bulgaria.
Any reform in the SJC would require a constitutional amendment.

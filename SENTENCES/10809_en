ZAGREB, Croatia -- Teachers went on strike Tuesday (5 October) -- International Teachers' Day -- to protest low wages in the sector. 
The government estimates 67 per cent of education system employees joined the strike, while their union said the figure was closer to 90 per cent. 
The unions are demanding wage hikes of 12 per cent, as salaries in the sector are among the lowest in the country. 
The government says it cannot raise salaries in one public sector, adding a wage increase in all sectors would violate an IMF agreement.

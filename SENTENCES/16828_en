BUCHAREST, Romania -- The fight against organised crime was the focus of discussions during visits British Home Secretary Charles Clarke made to Romania and Bulgaria on Wednesday (5 April). 
According to a statement he issued in Bucharest, London is impressed with the reform progress achieved by Romania as regards justice and borders control.
In Sofia, Clarke told Bulgarian counterpart Minister Rumen Petkov that he did not believe the country's EU membership would be delayed from 2007 to 2008. 
He cautioned, however, that problems highlighted by the European Commission regarding organised crime must be tackled.

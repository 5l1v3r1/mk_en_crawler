BIJELJINA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The court in Bijeljina postponed the trial involving the local Orao Aviation Bureau, which has been accused of illegal arms exports to Iraq.
One of the judges said Monday (28 July) the trial would open on 15 September, as some of the 17 defendants had not received their summons on time.
Prosecutors filed criminal charges against Orao directors and employees, as well as against seven customs officers.
Also Monday, the chairman of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, Milorad Dodik, told reporters he would testify Tuesday before the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague at the trial of former Bosnian Prime Minister Radoslav Brdjanin.
Dodik refused to testify voluntarily but was later forced to take the stand.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker urged the Kosovo parliament Tuesday (October 2nd) to stop adopting laws based on former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for the province.
Ruecker insists that such measures cannot be imposed before Kosovo's status is finalised.
Last week, parliament passed a law on state symbols -- flag, anthem and coat of arms -- in line with Ahtisaari's proposal for supervised independence.
Also Tuesday, Kosovo negotiating team spokesman Skender Hyseni said the platform on "good neighbourly relations" with Serbia will be presented again at the next meeting of the two teams in Brussels
In other news, Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimann took office Monday as new head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo.
Analysts say one of his main challenges will be to assist with local and parliamentary elections, scheduled for November 17th.

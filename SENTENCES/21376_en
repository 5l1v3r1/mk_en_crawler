ZUBIN POTOK, Kosovo -- Hundreds of Kosovo Serbs gathered in Zubin Potok Monday (August 25th) to protest what they describe as efforts to impose a borderline between Kosovo and Serbia. 
The protesters also opposed recognition of EULEX, the EU-led mission in the former Serbian province. 
Zubin Potok Mayor Slavisa Ristic said the installation of video cameras at the administrative line between Kosovo and Serbia is aimed at establishing customs control and a state boundary. 
Kosovo Serbs will never allow this, he added. 
A spokesman for the Kosovo Police Service, however, said the cameras were there to help control traffic.
Quality of life for Serbs in Kosovo was a central topic of discussions Monday in Belgrade between UNMIK deputy chief Nicholas Haysom and Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic. 
In the third such meeting with UNMIK representatives over the past six weeks, the focus was everyday issues confronting the Kosovo Serb minority at home and in the workplace. 
Serbian media reported that police and judicial matters also were topics.

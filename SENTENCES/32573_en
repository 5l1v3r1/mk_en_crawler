WASHINGTON, United States -- The House of Representatives passed a law Wednesday (5 March) allowing the government to grant normal trade relations to Serbia-Montenegro. 
The measure would result in lower tariffs on imports. 
Congressman Ben Cardin said lawmakers decided to remove a provision linking trade normalisation to better co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal after receiving assurances from the Serbian government that it would find and arrest indictees.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva vowed on Monday (21 November) that her country would continue with "more aggressive implementation" of set reforms, during a meeting with British Minister for Europe Douglas Alexander in Brussels. 
Mitreva briefed Alexander, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, about measures her government plans to take to implement priorities outlined in the European Commission's latest report on Macedonia. 
Afterwards, Alexander praised the progress made that resulted in approval of Macedonia's application for official EU candidate status.
Also Monday, Macedonia's Parliament endorsed the deployment of the country's eighth contingent to serve in the international coalition in Iraq. 
The unit will deploy in December, to relieve the unit rotating home.

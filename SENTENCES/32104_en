BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana said the EU will take over the NATO monitoring mission in Macedonia starting in January. 
Solana told the German daily Die Welt that rapid reaction units are already being formed. 
The news comes a day after NATO formally agreed to extend its mission in Macedonia until 15 December. 
The Netherlands will continue to play the lead role in this effort. 
Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski recently requested the extension of the 800-member mission after it became clear that the EU would not be ready to take it over when the mandate expires 26 October. 
Plans were stalled by a dispute between Greece and non-EU member Turkey. 
NATO's Operation Amber Fox provides security for international monitors who are overseeing the re-entry of security forces into former crisis areas.

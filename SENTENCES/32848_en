BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu said Friday (31 January) Romania would agree to provide logistical support and airspace to US-led forces in a possible military campaign against Iraq.
Romania will take an official stand on the conflict on 10 February at the meeting of the Supreme Defence Council, following the return of Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana from his ongoing visit to the United States.
Iliescu said public opinion in Romania favours the US position, citing a recent survey by Gallup International.
According to the poll, 49 per cent of Romanians support a military campaign against Iraq, and 45 per cent said that Romania should give its support.
Some 41 per cent said they oppose a military intervention.(Rompres - 03/02/03)

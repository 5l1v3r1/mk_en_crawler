TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Wednesday (March 24th) that fighting drug trafficking and marijuana growers top the list of priorities Albania must achieve before it can benefit from the EU visa liberalisation process.
At a conference in Tirana to discuss a plan to fight drug cultivation and trafficking, Berisha praised police efforts.
He also urged mayors across the country to be more active in reporting cultivators, warning that unless they co-operate, they will face consequences themselves.

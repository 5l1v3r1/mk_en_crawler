SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament gave final approval on Tuesday (December 11th) to the new national security agency that will deal with most threats and with counter-intelligence.
The agency will combine duties currently held by the interior ministry's National Security Service, the Financial Intelligence Agency, and the military counterintelligence office.
The new structure, which will become effective January 1st 2008, will be supervised by a special parliamentary committee.
This is a compromise, following heated disputes in parliament about whether the agency head should be appointed by the president.
Concerns remain however.
Critics say the government is trying to set up an agency similar to the former security services, even though many international experts suggest that a combined structure is much more effective in fighting terrorism.

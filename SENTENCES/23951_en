BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office indicted Radu Timofte, former chief of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), on charges of fraud and forgery, media reported.
The charges Friday (May 15th) stem from the purchase of an apartment from the country's state protocol authority (RA-APPS).
Prosecutors say Timofte failed to declare he already owned an apartment in Bucharest when he submitted a request to purchase an apartment owned by the RA-APPS.
Former SRI deputy chiefs Ion Popescu, Ionel Marin and Dumitru Zamfir are also charged with fraud and forgery in connection with the case.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- A delegation of 15 ambassadors to the UN Security Council, on a weekend visit to Kosovo, urged residents to build a democratic, multiethnic society.
Ole Peter Kolby, Norway's UN ambassador, told local officials Sunday (15 December) that the province would face "self-isolation" and a bleak future if the rights of minorities are not respected.
During a visit to the divided town of Mitrovica, Kolby said the Serb community must do more to integrate.
The delegation was to head next to Belgrade for Monday meetings with Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

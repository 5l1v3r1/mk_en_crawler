ATHENS, Greece -- Immediately after wrapping up Greece' six-month presidency of the EU, Prime Minister Costas Simitis called an extraordinary meeting of the Executive Office of the country's ruling party, PASOK, on Wednesday (2 July).
Though Simitis did not comment on his reason for summoning PASOK's senior members, media reports suggest a possible reshuffle both in the cabinet and in the ruling party, intended to help PASOK regain public support.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Jew has taken his country to court over a rule in the constitution that allows only Muslims, Serbs and Croats to run for members of the tripartite presidency.
Jakob Finci, who leads a small Jewish community in Sarajevo, has filed a lawsuit at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, seeking a ruling that would allow Jews and other minorities to run for president.
His action is backed by human rights organisations, such as the London-based Minority Rights Group International.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Over 1,000 police officers gathered in front of the interior ministry's headquarters in Sofia on Sunday (December 21st) to demand better pay and working conditions, media reported.
That was their second such demonstration in the past week.
Since the law prohibits police from staging any kind of strike, the officers wore civilian clothes and carried no guns.
Similar rallies occurred in a dozen towns across the country, including Pleven and Silistra in the north and Haskovo and Smoljan in the south.
On Friday meanwhile, students held a silent rally to urge the government to step up its fight against crime.
Earlier this month, drunk youths fatally beat a student named Stoyan Baltov.
Also Friday, hundreds of farmers on tractors blocked traffic in Sofia, demanding larger grain subsidies.

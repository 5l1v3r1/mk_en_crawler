PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government announced on Thursday (August 12th) that Montenegro will continue to launch the so-called "economic citizenship" programme, while taking into account its commitments as part of its EU bid. 
The announcement followed a meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Nebojsa Kaludjerovic and Florian Horner, of the EU delegation to Montenegro. 
It was scheduled after Brussels requested information about measures Podgorica would take to ensure no figures in organised crime take advantage of the programme. 
Under the initiative announced earlier this week, Montenegro will offer citizenship to any member of the business community who invests over 500,000 euros in the country.

IZMIR, Turkey -- A moderate earthquake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale shook Turkey's third-largest city, Izmir, very early Thursday (10 April), injuring more than 100 people.
Many of the injuries were sustained when residents, jolted awake, jumped from balconies and windows, according to provincial Governor Yusuf Ziya.
"We felt it quite strongly, it was very frightening.
Afterwards we stayed outdoors," one local resident told Reuters.
Izmir is on the Aegean Sea.

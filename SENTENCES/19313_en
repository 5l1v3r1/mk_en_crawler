ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police smashed a local human-trafficking network, arresting 28 people Thursday (September 27th).
Officials say the group was smuggling mainly Turkish and Albanian nationals into Croatia and on to Slovenia and Western Europe.
At least 150 illegal immigrants were trafficked since the beginning of the year, paying between 600 and 4,500 euros apiece.
Officials say they were usually transported with regular flights from Turkey to Zagreb or Sarajevo or from Albania to Montenegro and then to EU member states.
The police services of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro helped crack the case.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Security Minister Barisa Colak dismissed allegations Friday (3 September) that a message from Osama bin Laden -- urging terror attacks on Russia -- has turned up in BiH. 
Some Russian media ran reports to that effect earlier in the week, amid the hostage crisis in southern Russia. 
Colak insisted there is no proof of such a message.
In other news Friday, Canada announced that it is reducing its SFOR contingent from 650 to 85. 
According to officials, the move is in light of the upcoming handover of military command in BiH from NATO to the EU.

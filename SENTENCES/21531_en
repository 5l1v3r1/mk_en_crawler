TIRANA, Albania -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he believes a visa liberalisation regime with Albania is close to completion. 
His comment followed a meeting Monday (October 27th) with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha in Tirana at which Berisha briefed him on efforts by various Albanian institutions to meet EU conditions. 
"Prime Minister [Sali] Berisha has kept the promises he gave to Europe. 
This opens the way to achieve positive results for all Albanian citizens," Frattini said. 
Albanian officials showed him the new biometric passports and electronic ID cards, key conditions for completing the visa liberalisation process. 
Frattini and Berisha also discussed bilateral economic relations, signing five accords aimed at boosting Italian investment in Albania.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU has issued a new warning to Belgrade:
co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal or risk suspension of Serbia-Montenegro's recently launched negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the first step towards membership in the Union.
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn met with Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus on Wednesday (1 February), saying Belgrade's co-operation with the tribunal has deteriorated in recent months.
For his part, Labus insisted Belgrade has been stepping up efforts.
However, a widely anticipated report by the Serbia-Montenegro Military Intelligence Agency about fugitive indictee Ratko Mladic reportedly presents no new information that could lead to his arrest.

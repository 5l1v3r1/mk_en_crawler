BUCHAREST, Romania -- Several parliamentary committees on Tuesday (November 4th) opposed the government's decision to postpone by six months a measure that gives teachers a 50% raise.
The education, privatisation and labour committees in the Senate all indicate they support the hikes, which were to go into effect on October 1st.
The government postponed them until April, citing budgetary concerns.
The opposition Democratic Liberal Party has gone so far as to file a no-confidence motion against the cabinet for postponing the pay hike.

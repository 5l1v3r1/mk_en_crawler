SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Speaker of Parliament Ognyan Gerdjikov said Thursday (9 December) that the next general election would likely be held on 26 June, or 3 July at the latest.
He noted that parliament must be dissolved 40 days before the election, which would mean some time in mid-May.
He added that the parties in parliament mostly support holding elections in June, in order to give the new cabinet more time to prepare the 2006 budget.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU member-states are busy analysing a European Commission (EC) report on Macedonia, UK Ambassador to Skopje Andrew Key said on Sunday (November 15th), in an interview with Radio Free Europe. 
He added that his country supports the EC recommendation to start membership talks with Macedonia and will say as much in December when the EU ministers meet. 
Key said he thinks new dynamics are possible in negotiations between Skopje and Athens over their name dispute, in light of the positive EC report and the new government in Greece.
Separately Sunday, EU Ambassador to Macedonia Erwan Fouere said a solution to the dispute must be found as soon as possible so Macedonia can continue towards EU membership. 
He urged both countries to seize the moment and find a compromise.

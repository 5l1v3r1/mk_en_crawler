VIENNA, Austria -- Turkish Ambassador to Austria Kadri Ecved Tezcan was summoned to the foreign ministry in Vienna on Wednesday (November 10th) to explain recent remarks he made about Austria's attitude towards immigrants.
In an interview with Austrian daily Die Presse earlier this week, Tezcan said Turks living in Austria are often accused of creating ghettos and are treated "like a virus".
Responding to Tezcan's remarks, the foreign ministry in Vienna said it is very unusual for a diplomat to act like this.
Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spinderlegger had a telephone conversation with his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu early Wednesday.
Shortly after, Tezcan arrived at the ministry to explain his comments.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Ljubljana-based International Institute for Balkans Studies (IFIMES) has published a study predicting the outcome of the December 12th snap elections and projects that Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) will win. 
According to IFIMES, the PDK's rivals are weakened, Kosovo media reported on Monday (November 22nd). 
The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, for instance, is feeling the absence of leader Ramush Haradinaj, who is awaiting war crimes re-trial at The Hague. 
As for the Democratic League of Kosovo, IFIMES concludes that leader Isa Mustafa has made two strategic mistakes: failing to undertake fundamental changes in the party leadership and failing to keep the son of former leader, Ibrahim Rugova, Uke Rugova, in the party. 
Two new political groups -- Vetevendosje and Fryma e Re-FER (New Spirit Party) -- will play a crucial role in forming the next government, IFIMES predicts.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Friday (June 19th), the Constitutional Court declared the cabinet's decision to ban work on Sundays unconstitutional. 
This means that all limits to retail trade on Sundays will be cancelled. 
The work ban, introduced in January, had retailers and other business owners howling over declining sales.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Government spokesman Cemil Cicek said on Thursday (15 April) that the National Security Council (NSC) is an advisory body, both in theory and in practice.
In an interview with the local TV channel NTV, Cicek said the Council's recommendations are viewed by the government as advice, which is then put in the broader context of public discussion.
The NSC's political influence has been criticised by the EU.
In other news, the IMF Executive Board convenes in Washington on Friday to debate the seventh review of Turkey's stand-by agreement with the Fund.
The review is expected to result in an approval, leading to the release of a $500m tranche.

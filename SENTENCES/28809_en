TIRANA, Albania -- The EP rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, is urging authorities in Tirana to inform citizens about the rules of EU visa liberalisation in order to avoid possible abuse.
Lifting the regime may be used in different ways and this may become a problem for the government, Fajon said Sunday (October 10th).
"Citizens have to understand they cannot stay longer than three months [and] they cannot work or apply for citizenship, as this might trigger some countries to reapply [the] visa-regime," said Fajon.
Next month, the EU is expected to give the green light to last week's decision by the EP, lifting the visa regime with both Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Separately, Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto said visa liberalisation will also bring possibilities for the youth to study abroad or participate in short term training programmes.
He added that the decision to lift the visa regime is historic.
Meanwhile, the ministry of education announced that 40,000 new university students will start the new academic year Monday.
This ministry's motto this year is Quality.

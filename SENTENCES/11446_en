BRUSSELS, Belgium -- During a meeting with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu in Brussels Tuesday (25 January), European Parliament (EP) President Josep Borell called for speeding up the reform process in Romania.
He also said the EP would likely decide in March to give Romania the go-ahead to sign its Accession Treaty the following month, clearing the way for EU entry in 2007.
Also Tuesday, the Romanian Justice Ministry launched a public debate on the draft national strategy for combating corruption.
The document is in line with the EU safeguard clause for Romania and the provisions of the Justice and Home Affairs negotiation chapter.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local police and UNMIK special prosecutors filed charges Wednesday (April 16th) against 21 Kosovo Serbs suspected of destroying the border crossing at Leposavic and Zubin Potok in northern Kosovo. 
After Kosovo declared independence on February 17th, Kosovo Serbs sacked and burned police and customs offices on the border. 
According to police, more arrests may come as the investigation continues. 
Charges could range from damaging public property to terrorism. 
The leader of the Serb National Council, Milan Ivanovic, said on Wednesday that Kosovo police are making false accusations against Serbs to destabilise the situation in the heavily Serb-dominated north.

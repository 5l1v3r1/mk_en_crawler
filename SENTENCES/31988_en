BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers decided Monday (21 October) to open talks with Albania on a Stabilisation and Accession Agreement, the first step on the long road to EU membership. 
The EU had previously refused to launch negotiations, telling officials that they must implement a number of economic and political reforms. 
Prime Minister Fatos Nano welcomed Monday's decision and said his government is working to strengthen institutions and to ensure respect for human rights. 
He also promised development of a market economy that would meet EU standards. 
The chairman of the Republican Party, Fatmir Mediu, called the decision a significant achievement for the country and urged the president to hold a round table to discuss implementation of the EU recommendations (AP, AFP, ATA - 21/10/02)

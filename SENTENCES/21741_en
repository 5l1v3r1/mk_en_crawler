BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, told the Vecernje Novosti on Tuesday (November 25th) that there is still no trace of fugitive Ratko Mladic. 
"We have never searched for Mladic as seriously and globally as now and our actions will continue and we will not stop until we find him," Ljajic said. 
Mladic's capture and that of fellow fugitive Goran Hadzic would allow Serbia to fulfil its commitments to The Hague tribunal and enhance its EU accession prospects.

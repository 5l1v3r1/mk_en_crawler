BATMAN, Turkey -- Two adults and one child have tested negative for avian influenza, according to local media reports.
The three were admitted to hospital with bird flu-like symptoms at the weekend after contact with birds.
Earlier, four children were hospitalised with such symptoms but they also tested negative and were released.
For the time being, there are no suspected cases in humans.
However, some domestic poultry had to be culled last week after the dangerous H5N1 strain of the virus resurfaced.

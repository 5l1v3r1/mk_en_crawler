THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte has given Belgrade until Monday (December 10th) to hand over Bosnian wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
The prosecutor, who is due to leave the war crimes tribunal at the end of the month, said in an interview Thursday that she will tell the UN Security Council that Serbia is not fully co-operating if Mladic is not delivered to The Hague.
The EU has initialed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade but has said it would not formally sign it until UN prosecutors are satisfied with the level of co-operation provided by Belgrade.
Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic agreed on Thursday that he thinks Mladic remains in the country.
But he told the Blic newspaper there was almost no chance of arresting him by next week, or even by the end of the month, when del Ponte's mandate ends.

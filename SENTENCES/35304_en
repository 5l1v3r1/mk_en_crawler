BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Wednesday (21 April) criticised the conviction of human rights activist Leyla Zana in a repeat trial in Turkey.
The recipient of the Sakharov Prize and three others were sentenced to 15 years in prison for belonging to an armed rebel group.
The court upheld a sentence issued in 1994.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said the European Commission "strongly deplores" the verdict, while an EU spokesman said the Union would be unable to open accession talks with a country holding political prisoners.
Italy's representative to the European Parliament, Luigi Vinci, described the court decision as insulting to both the Parliament and Turkey (AFP, AP, BBC, NTV, Anadolu Agency, TRT 2, Turkish Daily News - 21/04/04)

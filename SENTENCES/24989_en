TIRANA, Albania -- The outcome of Sunday's (June 28th) parliamentary elections hinges on the results in the remaining 80 polling centres where votes have yet to be counted, media reported on Wednesday.
According to the latest figures, the coalition led by the ruling Democratic Party won 70 seats, followed by the Coalition for Change, led by the main opposition Socialist Party, with 66.
The Socialist Movement for Integration is currently third with four seats and may end up playing the role of kingmaker, should it back either party.
Also on Tuesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said Brussels will evaluate the election process before it continues processing Albania's EU integration bid.
"Albania has made huge progress," he said."However, we need to read carefully international observers' reports on the elections before deciding on the procedures related to Albania's application." Sweden assumed the rotating EU presidency on Wednesday.

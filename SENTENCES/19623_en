SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts announced on Thursday (November 23rd) the recovery of more than 600 bodies from a mass grave near the village of Kamenica in eastern BiH.
They are thought to be victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Ismet Music, an official of the regional commission for missing persons, said it was the largest site found this year.
He added that due to the specific microclimatic conditions, many of the remains -- even faces -- were intact, facilitating identification.
To date, the remains of 3,600 Srebrenica victims have been exhumed from ten mass graves in the Kamenica valley.

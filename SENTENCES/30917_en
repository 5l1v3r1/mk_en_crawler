PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Gunmen fired on a car carrying a member of the Central Election Commission (CEC) in Leposavic, northern Kosovo on Wednesday (December 8th), killing him and injuring another person.
The victim -- Sefko Salkovic -- was an employee of the CEC and the leader of ethnic Bosniaks in five villages in the north.
Media reported the incident as an attack against representatives of Kosovo institutions by Serbian parallel structures active in the area.
The CEC condemned the shooting, calling it a direct attack on the elections process since Salkovic was killed while on duty.

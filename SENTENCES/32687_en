PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Polls opened Sunday (22 December) across the republic, though low voter turnout may scuttle the effort to elect a new president, as has happened in Serbia. 
A total of 11 candidates are running for the post. 
Polls indicate the clear front-runner is Parliamentary Speaker Filip Vujanovic, who has been acting president since Milo Djukanovic resigned from the post to assume the position of prime minister. 
The opposition is boycotting the vote to protest what it calls the government's failure to ensure political consensus on election laws. 
International observers are urging voters to cast ballots: if turnout dips below 50 per cent, the results would be invalid.

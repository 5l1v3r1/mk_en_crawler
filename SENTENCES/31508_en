ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Sunday (20 April) that he believes the Cyprus question would be resolved within a year, and urged both sides to continue negotiations. 
He rejected speculation that the government plans to annex the Turkish-populated northern part of Cyprus. 
During a weekend visit to the divided island, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that the Cyprus administration is working on an economic and political plan which envisions granting passports and other benefits to Turkish Cypriots, as well as representation of Turkish Cypriots in the European Parliament.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Central Election Commission (CEC) has certified 48 political parties and 10 independent candidates for participation in the 1 October general elections. 
At a news conference Saturday (3 June), CEC head Branko Petric said the commission rejected the application of one independent candidate because he had been sanctioned by the Office of the High Representative. 
One political formation, Zeleni BiH, will not be able to participate in the elections for the state-level parliament, as it did not present the required minimum number of supportive signatures. 
However, Petric said, it will be allowed to run in the entity and cantonal level elections.

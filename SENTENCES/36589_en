SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In a report released Tuesday (3 August), the International Crisis Group (ICG) said Macedonia's stability remains fragile.
According to the group, the political calm demonstrated in the face of potentially destabilising events such as the death of the president and violence in neighbouring Kosovo is promising.
However, the report cautioned that the ongoing power decentralisation process is a major challenge for the country.
Reforming the economy, stimulating employment and strengthening the rule of law also present challenges, the ICG said, stressing that EU integration is the only path to stability.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Security services reportedly have arrested a man linked to the March terrorist attacks on trains in Madrid. 
According to media reports Wednesday (12 May), a Bulgarian national identified as Tony Radev was picked up in Sofia. 
Sources say he left Spain on 3 March and was detained on 8 April, but the arrest was kept secret. 
Radev's name apparently surfaced in documents seized by Spanish police in a series of raids. 
According to Madrid media, he may have provided some of the mobile phones that were used to detonate the deadly bombs.

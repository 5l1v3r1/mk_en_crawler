SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's 1.7 million registered voters went to the polls Sunday (27 March) for the second round of the country's local elections. 
A total of 5,192 domestic monitors and 260 foreign ones are observing the vote, which is taking place in 57 out of 85 municipalities. 
The first round two weeks ago was marred by irregularities, but international officials expressed hope that the problems would not re-emerge in the runoff. 
Official results will be announced on Wednesday.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The ruling Democratic Party (PDK) candidate won the mayoral race in Gjilan on Sunday (March 14th), the third time it's been held.
Qemajl Mustafa beat Fatmir Rexhepi of the Democratic League of Kosovo by 5,000 votes.
The Central Elections Commission said no incidents were reported and that turnout was around 41%.
Local Serbs were among them.
Voters had to go to the polls three times to elect their mayor after irregularities were found in the mid-December run-off that followed the November election.

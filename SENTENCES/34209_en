BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Four children who survived a massacre that killed nearly their whole family are due in court Wednesday (9 July) to testify against those accused of the murders. 
The four, all ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, were among 24 people rounded up by Serb paramilitaries and gunned down in March 1999, in one of the most horrific acts of the Kosovo conflict. 
A fifth child who was supposed to testify was overcome with emotion and had to be flown out of Belgrade hours after landing. 
The five have been living in Manchester, England for the past four years.

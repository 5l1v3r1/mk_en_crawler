LONDON, United Kingdom -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday (20 December) that bringing Turkey closer to EU membership is of fundamental importance to peace and security in the world. 
He characterised the EU's decision to launch accession talks with Ankara as the achievement of "a historic British objective", adding that it proves there is no conflict between Christians and Muslims.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell also hailed the EU decision. 
"A Turkey that is firmly anchored in Europe â¦ will be a positive force for prosperity and democracy," Powell said.

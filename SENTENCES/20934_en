BUCHAREST, Romania -- Leaders of Romania's main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) met on Tuesday (September 4th) and agreed to submit a motion for a no confidence vote against the cabinet of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, as proposed by the PSD Executive Committee.
PSD honorary president Ion Iliescu strongly opposes the move and accuses party president Mircea Geoana of "not thinking ahead and exposing the party to ...
unpredictable actions".
The PSD, the Democratic Party and the Liberal Democratic Party say the cabinet lacks transparency and professionalism.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and ambassadors from the 26 NATO member states arrived in Pristina on Thursday (22 April). 
A spokeswoman said the visit was not in response to last month's outbreak of violence in Kosovo, but added that the issue would be discussed with local leaders. 
The Alliance is considering whether to appoint a political representative on Kosovo, as EU security chief Javier Solana did three weeks ago. 
The delegation is scheduled to hold talks with UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri and President Ibrahim Rugova, among others.
In other news, a Kosovo daily reported Wednesday that British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane has urged Rugova to apologise publicly for the violence against Serbs in March. 
MacShane also called on local leaders to work to meet standards set by the UN.

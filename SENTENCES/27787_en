TIRANA, Albania -- Wildfires are spreading across Albania, mainly due to the dry season and strong winds.
Local media reported on Tuesday (August 24th) that about 60 hectares of vineyards and olive groves have been destroyed by the flames.
Difficult terrain is hampering fire fighting efforts.
In the northern area of Shkodra, fires are threatening homes in two villages, prompting evacuations.
The Environment Ministry's Directorate of Environmental Control says a number of fires were intentionally set to clear fields.

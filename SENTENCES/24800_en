PRAGUE, Czech Republic/BELGRADE, Serbia -- Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg has said Serbia's further rapprochement with the EU should not depend on the arrest of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, media reported on Saturday (January 3rd). 
"Just think how many murderers in my country went unpunished after World War II. 
Therefore, we cannot say that Serbia must not be integrated over a single murderer," Schwarzenberg told German political monthly Cicero.
Meanwhile, Serbia's war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Saturday he expects Mladic's arrest to happen this year, which will allow Serbia to complete its co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
"I think no one can doubt the political will, and I think that [war crimes indictees Radovan] Karadzic's and [Stojan] Zupljanin's arrests made this clear," Vukcevic said to B92.

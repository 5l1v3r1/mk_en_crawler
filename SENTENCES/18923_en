BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors demanded on Tuesday (April 3rd) the maximum sentence for five former members of the Serbian paramilitary police unit Scorpions, charged with killing six Bosniak youths in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995.
In his closing statement, Deputy Prosecutor for War Crimes Nebojsa Markovic said that there was indisputable evidence that the defendants -- Slobodan Medic, Pera Petrasevic, Aleksandar Medic, Aleksandar Vukov and Branislav Medic -- were fully aware of what they were doing to their young victims.
The five were charged as a result of a videotape of the killings that surfaced last June.

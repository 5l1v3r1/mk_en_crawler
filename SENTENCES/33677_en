PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi denied Saturday (6 September) that agreement has been reached on starting talks between Pristina and Belgrade, as Serbian-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic has suggested.
Svilanovic said the talks should focus on problems such as refugee returns, tracking missing persons and boosting security.
In other news, a police officer was killed in a weekend shooting in Djakovica, after returning home from work.
A UN spokesman identified the victim as Hajdar Ahmeti, an ethnic Albanian serving with the Kosovo Police Service.

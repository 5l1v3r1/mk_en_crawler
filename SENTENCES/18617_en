BRUSSELS, Belgium -- At their regular meeting on Thursday (December 7th) in Brussels, the political directors of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) strongly criticised the idea of reopening talks on police reform in BiH.
A subsequent statement by the Office of the High Representative urged BIH political parties to instead overcome the deadlock regarding the work of the police reform directorate.
The PIC also expressed concern that, more than two months after the October 1st elections, governments at the State and Federation level have yet to be formed.

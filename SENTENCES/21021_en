ATHENS, Greece -- The government's plans for national air carrier Olympic Airlines will not harm the interests of employees, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said on Monday (December 3rd) amid concerns about difficult times ahead for the company and rumours of a shutdown.
The company has been mired in financial trouble since the European Commission found that it received 600m euros in illegal state subsidies between 1998 and 2002.
According to some sources, the government is preparing to close down the carrier in 2008 and establish a new, smaller company that would then be sold off.
Transport and Communications Minister Kostas Hatzidakis discussed the airline with EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot at the weekend.
Hatzidakis insists the government has no plans to fire anyone and is instead committed to keeping Olympic flying.
The Athens-based newspaper Vima reports that Arab companies have expressed some interest in acquiring the airline, as has a tycoon from Qatar.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists on Sunday (November 4th) released eight Turkish troops kidnapped last month after an ambush.
Twelve soldiers were killed in the ambush, which galvanised the government into considering a cross-border military operation on Iraqi territory.
In other news, during a security conference on Iraq hosted by Istanbul on Saturday, the Iraqi government pledged to help Turkey end attacks by the PKK.
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said Baghdad would arrest PKK leaders and close its offices.
But he ruled out shutting down PKK camps in mountainous northern Iraq, saying "it is not in our capacity" to capture the rebels.
"It is not possible for Turkey to do it either," he added.
After attending the conference, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan flew to Washington, where he meets on Monday with US President George W. Bush.
Erdogan told reporters he hopes the United States would take concrete steps against the PKK.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot official Osman Ertug announced on Monday (October 18th) that the community has decided to cancel this year's Toros military exercise, to demonstrate support for ongoing reunification talks on the divided island. 
The decision to call off the drill was made following consultations with Turkey, Ertug said. 
The Greek Cypriot side also cancelled its annual Nikiforos exercise this year, as it's done since 2007.
Meanwhile, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu held another round of talks Monday, this one again focusing on the complex property issue.

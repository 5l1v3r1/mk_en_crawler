SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors filed charges against energy tycoon Hristo Kovachki for 8m euros in tax evasion, Bozhidar Dzhambazov, of the Sofia prosecutor's office, told reporters Tuesday (August 18th).
Investigators say the businessman failed to declare income stemming from deals involving four of his companies between 2005 and 2008.
Kovachki, 46, could face up to eight years in prison if convicted.
The sentence could be reduced if he pays the taxes.
Kovachki was first accused nine months ago.
He was detained briefly and released after posting a record bail of 100,000 euros.
Kovachki denies any wrongdoing.
He has also been accused of vote-buying, in connection with last month's parliamentary elections.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The state department on Tuesday (30 September) defended Greece's security arrangements for the 2004 Summer Olympics. 
Spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters that Athens has the "will and resources" to make the Games a success. 
His remarks followed a report in the <I>Washington Post</I> last week which claimed undercover inspections had found lapses in security.
In other news, five car bombs rattled Athens early Tuesday but caused no injuries. 
The targets included opposition parliamentarian Giorgos Voulgarakis, Professor Giorgos Veltsos and journalist Anna Panagiotarea.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 20 people were injured on Friday (September 17th) during a protest of vine-growers in Orahovac.
Some 500 growers blocked regional roads with tractors to protest failed negotiations with a local winery which refused to buy their products.
The police used tear gas to disperse protesters who threw stones at the winemaker's building.
Several people were detained.

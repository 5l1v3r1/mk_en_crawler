SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Survey results released on Tuesday (18 July) show that Bulgarian citizens support judicial reforms backed by USAID.
The survey, conducted by Alpha Research at the request of USAID, was based on interviews with 3,200 respondents in 30 cities.
The results show that the quality of court services has improved by 15 per cent and courts' performance by 5 per cent, while the speed of court procedures has increased by 18 per cent.
However, the public remains critical about the work of courts in the four largest cities -- Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Bourgas.
The survey authors say that reform efforts must be concentrated in big cities, while the state must increase the number of judges and upgrade the courts' material base.

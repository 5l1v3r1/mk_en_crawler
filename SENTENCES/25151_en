ANKARA, Turkey -- The army announced on Tuesday (October 27th) it has launched an investigation into reports of a plan from within its ranks to topple the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
The alleged plot first surfaced in June, when the Taraf newspaper reported it had obtained a copy of a document containing details of it. 
Initially, Army Chief of General Staff General Ilker Basbug denied the report, claiming the document was "forged" and "part of a smear campaign". 
Media, political parties, and bar associations have since called on him to either resign or disband junta groups within the armed forces.

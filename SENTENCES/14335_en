SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police detained another alleged mafia boss, Zlatomir Ivanov, a.k.a. 
"the Beret", on Wednesday (9 November). 
Once a member of the interior ministry's antiterrorist squad, Ivanov is rumoured to be one of the most influential figures in the underground world. 
He was arrested on charges of possessing illegal firearms. 
No stranger to arrest, he has been released repeatedly for lack of evidence. 
The new detention comes shortly after two notorious crime lords, the Margin brothers, were taken into custody. 
A number of police sweeps have been conducted in Bulgaria since the murder last month of one of the country's top bankers, Emil Kyulev.

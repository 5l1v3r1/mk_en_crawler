LONDON, Great Britain -- Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met with Greek counterpart Petros Molyviatis in London on Thursday (2 December).
They discussed EU enlargement issues, ahead of the 17 December summit.
Molyviatis said Greece supports Turkey's bid to join the EU, but cautioned that the outcome depends on whether Turkey has the political will to adopt EU criteria, principles and values.

PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US and Italian SFOR troops searched the post office in Pale on Thursday (19 February), the offices of Telekom Srpske, and a radio station owned by Radovan Karadzic's daughter, Sonja.
SFOR said in a statement that the "unannounced inspections" were part of efforts to dismantle the networks supporting fugitive war crimes suspects.
Visiting Sarajevo meanwhile, German Defence Minister Peter Struck said German troops in SFOR would continue searching for indicted war criminals, including top fugitives Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
SFOR's mandate "includes arrest of war crimes suspects, and of course we remain committed to that task", Struck said after meeting with BiH presidency Chairman Dragan Covic.
Struck reiterated that bringing fugitives to justice is crucial to entry in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
In other news, a court in Sarajevo ordered BiH's largest media group Avaz to pay 5,100 euros to former Foreign Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija for falsely accusing him of corruption in a 2002 series of reports.

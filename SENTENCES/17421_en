ANKARA, Turkey -- Massoud Barzani, the president of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, called on Monday (February 26th) for direct talks with Ankara to ease tensions along the border between the Iraqi province and Turkey. 
"We are extending to Turkey a hand of friendship. 
We will be pleased if Turkey responds in kind", he said. 
Turkey had frequently accused the Iraqi authorities of failing to curb attacks by terrorists from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul have signalled that they are prepared for dialogue.
The issue of a referendum in the oil rich Iraqi city of Kirkuk has caused tensions between Erdogan and Barzani. 
Turkey fears it will lead to Kurdish control of the city, which in turn could lead to the funding of PKK terrorists with oil revenues. 
On Monday, Erdogan criticised a comment by Barzani, who described Kirkuk as "the heart of Kurdistan". 
Erdogan insisted that Kirkuk belongs to no single ethnic group and that such remarks do not advance peace efforts.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said in an interview Monday (July 14th) that Serbia's plan to withdraw its ambassadors from countries recognising Kosovo's independence may undergo revision.
"We will review developments with the aim of optimising our diplomatic presence.
At this moment there is no decision on the revision of the Action Plan.
But, I repeat, we will analyse the circumstances dynamically," Jeremic told the Belgrade-based newspaper Blic.

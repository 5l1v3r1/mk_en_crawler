TIRANA, Albania -- The country's motion for visa liberalisation with the EU is expected to suffer another postponement, this one lasting until 2010, according to a report quoted by local media Sunday (November 23rd). 
The report by France, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, addresses duties and responsibilities of countries that have signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
The report, which observers expect the EU to release next week, cites the inefficiency of measures against organised crime and corruption as a major obstacle to dialogue on free movement of Albanian citizens within the EU.
In other news Sunday, local media reported that police in the town of Shkodra have pressed charges against Ombudsman Ermir Dobjani and the institution he runs for obstructing a police investigation. 
Police say he interfered as they questioned a young suspect about a murder committed 11 years ago.

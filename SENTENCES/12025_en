BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic said Monday (14 March) that the ministry is set to continue activities aimed at achieving full co-operation between the entity and the UN war crimes tribunal.
Returning from The Hague, where he accompanied indictee Gojko Jankovic, Matijasevic reiterated that the families of fugitives who surrender would receive government assistance, while the indictee would be offered provisional release on bail.
Those who fail to surrender face arrest, he added.
In other news, Britain reportedly is calling on Dragan Covic to resign as the Croat member of BiH's tripartite presidency.
He was charged last week with embezzlement and abuse of office, stemming from a scandal in 2000 involving the local meat industry.
He was Federation of BiH finance minister at the time.

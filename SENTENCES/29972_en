ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Saturday (February 26th) that Turkey will not sign a readmission agreement approved by EU interior ministers Thursday unless talks begin that would remove visa requirements for citizens travelling to the bloc.
Under the deal, all illegal migrants who have entered the bloc via Turkey will be returned to their country of entry, excluding political asylum seekers.
"Reports are talking about a visa dialogue without a clear target for visa exemption.
Our stance is clear.
Turkey in no way accepts different treatment," Davutoglu said.

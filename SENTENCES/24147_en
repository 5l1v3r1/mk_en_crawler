TIRANA, Albania -- The High Court in Tirana postponed the trial of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu which was slated to start Monday (June 15th), due to a judge's absence for medical reasons.
Mediu is charged with abuse of power in connection with last year's Gerdec ammunition depot explosions, which killed 26 people and injured another 300.
An additional 28 officials are charged in the Gerdec case, but Mediu will stand trial separately.

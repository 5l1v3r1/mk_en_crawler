ANKARA, Turkey -- Economy Minister Ali Babacan said on Sunday (6 April) his country was looking forward to receiving a total of $5.2 billion in loans from the IMF by the end of 2004.
He explained that the government has reached an agreement with the World Bank and the IMF on rescheduling debt payments to help the Turkish economy tackle the current recession.
The government has sent a letter of intent to the Fund, clearing the way for a fresh tranche of assistance.
The IMF board of directors is due to meet 18 April to release anywhere between $700m and $1.6 billion from a $16 billion loan package.
Turkey also hopes to get seven other tranches of $500m each by the end of December 2004.

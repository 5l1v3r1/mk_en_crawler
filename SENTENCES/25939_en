BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Thursday (December 17th) that his party will not participate in a coalition government with the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL). 
"Things with us are extremely clear. 
If [President Traian] Basescu and [Prime Minister-Designate Emil] Boc want to rule, then they should take their own responsibility. 
Our proposal was to establish a government of national unity with a prime minister that has been approved by all sides," Geoana said. 
Earlier, Geoana described Boc's nomination as prime minister-designate as "inappropriate", adding that Basescu missed an historic chance to achieve national conciliation. 
Basescu just won a second term as president following a tight run-off with Geoana.

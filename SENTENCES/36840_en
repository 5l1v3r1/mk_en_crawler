SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Three right-wing parties decided to form a pre-election coalition over the weekend. 
The new coalition consists of the Union of Free Democrats, led by embattled Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski, the Bulgarian Agriculture People's Union and the nationalist VMRO. 
The three parties will participate jointly in next year's parliamentary vote and intend to form a single group if they win.
In other news, a group of defectors from the ruling National Movement Simeon II has officially become a political party. 
Emil Koshloukov was elected chairman of the New Time party, which previously had been a parliamentary formation.

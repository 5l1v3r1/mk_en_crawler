SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Tuesday (22 April), Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) leader Ali Ahmeti acknowledged difficulties in implementing all provisions of the Ohrid peace accord, but he insisted the country is not destabilised.
His comments were in response to Saturday's decision by the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) to boycott parliament, in protest of slow implementation of the provisions.
Ahmeti cited the ruling coalition's strong commitment to overcoming obstacles and bringing the peace process to a successful conclusion.
DUI is a member of that coalition, while DPA is not.

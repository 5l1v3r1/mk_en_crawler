SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski said on Wednesday (6 July) that he would convene a session of the National Security Council on 15 July in light of recent developments in Brest and Kondovo. 
Last week, police found a large amount of illegal weapons and explosives in the house of a former ethnic Albanian guerrilla in Brest. 
Separately, in Kondovo, members of an ethnic Albanian gang attacked local Muslim religious leaders. 
While insisting the security situation is stable, Crvenkovski said the incidents should not be underestimated.
In other news, General Miroslav Stojanovski was sworn in Wednesday as the new head of the Macedonian Army's general staff. 
He succeeds General Georgi Bojadziev, who retired.

ATHENS, Greece -- The International Federation of the Phonographic Industries warned tourists on Thursday (20 May) that buying pirated CDs in Greece is a criminal offence.
The announcement came after a man received a three-month jail sentence for purchasing a counterfeit disc from an Athens street vendor.
The Federation said it has shifted its focus to buyers, with the support of Greek authorities.
Greece has the highest piracy rate in Western Europe.

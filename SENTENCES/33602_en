NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council held a Saturday night (13 September) session dedicated to the situation in Kosovo.
Assistant Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Hedi Annabi said that no one has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks against Kosovo Serbs and UN officials in the province.
He called for reviewing and revising UN security measures there.
He criticised both the government's talk of independence as well as Belgrade's declaration on Kosovo and appealed for closer implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Also discussed were concrete details about launching talks between Belgrade and Pristina.

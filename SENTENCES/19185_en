SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak repeated Tuesday (January 29th) his concerns over the failure of BiH institutions to agree on the 2008 state budget and forward it to parliament. 
In a statement on the Office of the High Representative's website, he said the situation demonstrates the collapse of BiH institutional co-ordination and shows that BiH institutions are not ready to engage in dialogue and find compromise on key political issues.
The BiH presidency is due to discuss the draft at an emergency session Wednesday, but Lajcak said a third rejection is imminent. 
"Failure to agree on the draft 2008 state budget will have a detrimental effect on BiH institutions and send a negative message to BiH's public and the country's international partners," he said.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A UN police spokesman announced Tuesday (13 May) that police in Republika Srpska have smashed a group that may have trafficked as many as 200 women across Europe. 
The alleged ringleader, Milorad Milakovic, and three other associates were arrested in Prijedor. 
Police also found six girls from Moldova and Romania locked up in a room with iron bars on the windows. 
"The scope of the evidence gathered strongly indicates that here we have witnessed the most decisive blow against this appalling criminal activity yet seen in BiH," UN spokesman Jon Oscar Solnes said at a press briefing.

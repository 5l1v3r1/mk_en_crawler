BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament's administrative committee removed the mandates of two G17 Plus deputies, Ksenija Milivojevic and Goran Paunovic, following heated debates Monday (15 May).
All deputies sign an unconditional resignation statement when they join the legislature, under which their mandates can be withdrawn if they stop following directions from the party on whose ticket they were elected.
Milivojevic and Paunovic are both seen as loyal to former Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, who stepped down earlier this month after the EU suspended integration negotiations with Belgrade.
He also has resigned his post as head of G17 Plus.
In other news, Dejan Milenkovic, a top suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, has been admitted to the Belgrade prison hospital, his lawyer announced on Monday.
He will be undergoing a thorough exam.
Milenkovic was first arrested in Greece in June 2004.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- About 200 journalists rallied in downtown Skopje on Monday (May 4th) to mark World Press Freedom Day. 
They were protesting convictions against journalists, political pressure, low wages and what they describe as generally poor levels of press freedom.
Robert Popovski of the Macedonian Journalists' Association said more than 160 lawsuits against journalists are currently pending or being heard in local courts. 
He added that journalists live and work in fear of losing their jobs, while the average monthly salary hovers around 250 euros. 
Macedonia was ranked 98th in the latest report by Freedom House and was in the group of countries deemed "partly free" in terms of freedom of the media.

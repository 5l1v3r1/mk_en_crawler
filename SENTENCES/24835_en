BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Ministry of Justice State Secretary Slobodan Homen said on Thursday (April 2nd) the government paid 670,000 euros to the family of Binghamton University student Bryan Steinhauer, who was beaten into a coma by fellow student and Serb basketball player Miladin Kovacevic in May 2008 in the United States.
Earlier this week, a US prosecutor officially transferred the responsibility for pressing criminal charges against Kovacevic to Serbia.
Kovacevic was arrested in Belgrade last October after fleeing the United States.
Serbian President Boris Tadic welcomed the agreement reached with Washington, describing it as "the most sensible way to free Belgrade-Washington relations from the burden of Kovcevic's case".

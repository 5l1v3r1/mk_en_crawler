SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During its party congress on Sunday (June 3rd), the junior government partner National Movement Simeon II changed its name to the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV). 
The party's political council was replaced at the convention, leading to a controversy among some party members. 
Solomon Passy, former minister of foreign affairs in the previous NDSV-led cabinet, made an improvised address, urging the party to depart from the ruling coalition. 
He received the support of most of the present delegates.
However, the party's founder, former King Simeon Saxe-Coburg, said withdrawing from the coalition government was not on NDSV's agenda (Sega, Novinar - 04/06/07; Darik, Mediapool - 03/06/07)

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul has convicted Noble Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk of "Insulting Turkishness", ordering him to pay a fine of $4,000 in compensation to several plaintiffs, local media reported on Sunday (March 27th). 
The sentence stemmed from a remark the writer made in 2005 that was published in a Swiss newspaper. 
Back then, he said about 30,000 Turks and 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey "and nobody but me dares to talk about it".

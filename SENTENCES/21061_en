SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Recent attacks on local journalists may affect efforts to join the EU and NATO, OSCE Secretary-General Marc Perrin de Brichambaut warned on Tuesday (October 2nd).
De Brichambaut, on a two-day visit to Macedonia, was referring to assaults on journalists inside and outside parliament last week, following a brawl among lawmakers.
He offered OSCE support in implementing various reforms.

Croatia's natural gas distribution network is expected to reach the Adriatic coast and Istrian peninsula in three years' time. 
Under an agreement signed in Split earlier this month, a loan from the European Investment Bank will help finance the 440m-euro project.
The 290 km-long pipeline will extend to Split and Dubrovnik, with connections to Zadar and Knin. 
Another branch will go north, to Istrian cities Pula and Umag, connecting the main gas line to the Hungarian border.
Although initial plans set 2011 as the year of completion, the government has now advanced the deadline to 2010.
Construction of this part will help Dalmatia and Lika utilise natural gas and thus reduce their dependence on electric power, especially in Dalmatia, authorities say. 
The project is part of a larger plan, covering the years 2002-2011, to develop and modernise gas transmission in Croatia.
"This government finds the gas pipeline network construction to be a priority in the energy sector," Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said. 
"No serious attempts existed earlier. 
We have decided to change things and succeeded. 
In only three years time, more than 500km of gas pipeline have been constructed in Croatia. 
"
The nine-year modernisation plan covers the Pula-Karlovac gas transmission system, the Central and Eastern Croatian systems, and Lika-Dalmatia. 
The Pula-Karlovac system was completed during the first development investment phase, from 2002 to 2006.
The Central and Eastern Croatian systems were next. 
In 2006, 480km of new pipelines were completely constructed and put into operation. 
A national dispatching centre was launched, as well as a fibre optic connection system.
The government hopes boosting natural gas use will help give a new impetus to economic development in Lika and Dalmatia. 
In addition, reducing dependence on electricity could be beneficial to the environment, authorities say.

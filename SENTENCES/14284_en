TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Sokol Olldashi vowed on Thursday (10 November) to break any links between the mafia and politics, insisting that he has a report with the names of specific left-wing politicians supported by organised crime groups.
He declined to elaborate.
Separately, he said that while the routes used by drug traffickers are familiar to the ministry, human traffickers have recently turned to new routes from Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia and Italy.
In other news Thursday, Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu met with Austrian counterpart Gunther Platter in Tirana.
They discussed possible ways to enhance military co-operation.

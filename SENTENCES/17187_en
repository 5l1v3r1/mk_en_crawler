ZAGREB, Croatia -- Controversial businessman Hrvoje Petrac pleaded not guilty to charges of involvement in the 2004 abduction of a teenager for ransom, as a retrial in the case began before the Zagreb County Court on Friday (29 September). 
He and his co-defendants denied claims by prosecutors that the ring planned to kidnap more children of wealthy parents. 
An appeals court had overturned earlier convictions on technical grounds. 
Petrac, a former aide to Croatian war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina, had been on the run for years but was extradited from Greece in August.

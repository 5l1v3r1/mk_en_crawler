BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic again spoke in favour of early parliamentary elections for the republic Sunday (5 December), suggesting next spring might be a good time. 
Tadic, whose Democratic Party currently stands in opposition, said early elections would not destabilise the political situation, and might resolve current problems with reforms and war crimes co-operation. 
On Monday, Tadic kicked off a three-day visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he will stress the importance of co-operation with The Hague tribunal.

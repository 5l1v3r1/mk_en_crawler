SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Investment in the Balkans soared by 60 per cent to $7 billion dollars in 2003, a senior OECD officer said in an interview Tuesday (2 November). 
Declan Murphy, OECD programme director for investment, added that foreign investment would exceed $7 billion in 2004. 
He cautioned, however, that the countries of the region must double or triple that figure if they want to catch up with the states of Central Europe. 
Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania are ahead of other countries in southeast Europe, but must nevertheless make it easier for foreign firms to register and obtain various licenses, Murphy said. 
He urged the three nations to share their experiences with Serbia-Montenegro and Albania, where economic reforms have been slower.

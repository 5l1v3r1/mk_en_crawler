BUDVA, Montenegro -- Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Gordana Djurovic said on Friday (February 23rd) that Montenegro could submit an official application for a EU candidate status next year, if it implements the necessary requirements. 
Her comment came during a conference on human rights, organised by the Montenegrin Helsinki Committee in Budva. 
Committee chief Slobodan Franovic stressed that one such priority related to EU integration progress is the adoption of a new constitution that would provide a democratic system of human rights and freedoms.

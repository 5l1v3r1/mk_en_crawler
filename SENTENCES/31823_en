NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash proposed on Wednesday (2 April) a six-point plan to reconcile the dispute over the island's division. 
He presented the proposal to Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, in hopes it would act as catalyst for settlement. 
The Turkish side suggests transfer of the fenced area of Varosha to Greek control in exchange for removal of economic sanctions against Northern Cyprus. 
The proposal also envisions normalising the flow of goods between the two parts of the island, facilitating freedom of movement and lifting restrictions on the movement of tourists. 
Denktash is requesting a response by 16 April.

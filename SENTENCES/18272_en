SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's Central Election Commission Chairman Stjepan Nikic confirmed on Tuesday (December 12th) that the BiH presidency has submitted three nominees for prime minister-designate. 
They are incumbent Prime Minister Adnan Terzic of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, Nikola Spiric of the Serb Union of Independent Social Democrats and Dragan Vrankic of the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH. 
The election commission will vet them, as will the State Investigation and Protection Agency.
In other news, about 150 former police officers from both entities, who were decertified by the old UN International Police Task Force from 1996 to 2002, ramped up their protest on Tuesday by starting a hunger strike. 
They and others argue that their human rights were violated during the certification process.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN and the EU have concluded technical talks on deploying the police and judicial mission EULEX in Kosovo.
Local media reported on Tuesday (July 29th) that the UN Department for Peacekeeping Operations in New York has approved the plan to significantly downsize UNMIK by year-end and to fully deploy EULEX.
In other news Monday, UNMIK Customs Service Director Naim Huruglica and the permanent secretary of the ministry of environment, Muhamet Aliu, were temporarily suspended for allowing dangerous toxic chemicals to enter Kosovo.
Police in central Kosovo seized trucks containing hazardous chemicals intended for a domestic company after UNMIK Customs allowed them to enter through Macedonia.
The trucks are now parked in Mitrovica, sparking protests among local residents.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Thursday (April 30th) hailed progress in reunification talks on the divided island of Cyprus. 
In a presidential statement read out by Mexican Ambassador Claude Heller, whose country currently holds the Council's presidency, the 15-member body urged the leaders of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot community to step up the momentum gained in the talks, which started last September.
Earlier in the day, UN Secretary General's special adviser on Cyprus, Alexander Downer, said that the issue remains complicated, though he voiced hope that reunification will happen. 
"It is important that all parties in Cyprus, north and south, do support these negotiations, because the alternative is a dark future," Downer said.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The State Electoral Commission on Friday (14 May) rejected a demand from the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE for a recount of election ballots in the presence of international monitors and representatives of the main political parties. 
According to the commission, Macedonian law does not allow for recounts. 
VMRO-DPMNE candidate Sasko Kedev was defeated in last month's presidential runoff by the ruling SDSM candidate, Branko Crvenkovski. 
VMRO-DPMNE insists turnout was actually below the required 51 per cent margin.
In other news Friday, US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler called on authorities to investigate whether state officials or institutions were involved in the so-called Rastanski Lozja case, in which police killed seven foreigners in March 2002. 
Former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski allegedly ordered the killings, claiming the men were Islamic terrorists.

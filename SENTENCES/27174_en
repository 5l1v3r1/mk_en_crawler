SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MANU) elected a new editorial board Wednesday (March 3rd) that will work on the country's encyclopaedia. 
The board's chief -- academician Mitko Madzunkov -- told reporters that editors will start by reviewing the old edition and drafting a new concept. 
The previous editorial board was sacked in November after the encyclopaedia sparked angry reactions among Albanian intellectuals and politicians inside Macedonia, as well as in Albania and Kosovo, because of the way it portrayed the Albanian community.

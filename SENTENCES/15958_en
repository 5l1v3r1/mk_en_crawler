BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade's action plan for co-operation with the UN tribunal would be considered a success if provides information about Ratko Mladic's whereabouts, tribunal prosecution spokesman Anton Nikiforov said Tuesday (18 July).
He outlined a scenario similar to that of Croatia -- which gave the court information about Ante Gotovina's movements, thus enabling the fugitive's arrest.
Croatia's stalled EU bid was unfrozen as a result.
On Tuesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told Serbian President Boris Tadic in Brussels that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the EU could be sealed by the end of the year if Belgrade implements the action plan with satisfactory results.

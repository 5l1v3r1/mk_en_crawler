NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government announced on Monday (October 29th) it will not participate in a forum with Britain scheduled for early next month, in protest of a new agreement between London and Ankara. 
At issue is a pact signed last week during Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's two-day visit to London.
The document underscores co-operation between the UK and Turkey, and calls for "more action in the fight against terrorism", including the exchange of intelligence and evidence. 
It also urges increased co-operation in trade, security, economy and culture. 
However, references to Northern Cyprus as the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and to ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots raised a red flag among Greek Cypriot authorities. 
Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Markoullis is not going to take part in the forum because of it, said government spokesman Vassilis Palmas.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Another member of the Serbian Anti-Corruption Council, journalist Misa Brkic, resigned on Monday (11 August), becoming the fifth member to do so. 
He cited the "investigative tone" other members had used in asking him about the purpose of his meeting last week with Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic. 
During that meeting, Brkic said, he and fellow council member Vojin Dimitrijevic discussed relations between the council and the government. 
Zivkovic has pledged full co-operation in fighting corruption.

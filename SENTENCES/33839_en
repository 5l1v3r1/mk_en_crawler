SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A court in Kumanovo on Wednesday (19 November) sentenced two men to 10 years in prison for planting a landmine which killed two Polish soldiers last March. 
Samet Lutvi and Sulejman Sulejmani, both ethnic Albanians from Macedonia, were responsible for the blast near the village of Sopot that also wounded the soldiers' Macedonian interpreter. 
The court found the defendants guilty of terrorism and threatening the security of citizens, the first verdict of the kind issued in the country.

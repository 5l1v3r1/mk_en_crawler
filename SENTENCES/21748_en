TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers on Monday (November 24th) passed the 2009 state budget, which totals about 4 billion euros. 
The government said the budget will offer support to both the middle class and the poor. 
The main opposition Socialist Party, however, voted against the bill, saying it lacks effective measures to cope with the global financial crisis.

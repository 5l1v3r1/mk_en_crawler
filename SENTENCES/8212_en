The iftar tent in the busy Eminonu district is an icon of the Ramadan celebration in Istanbul.
Long lines form as the hour of breaking the fast approaches.
For a brief period following the call to prayer (ezan), the normal hustle and bustle of Eminonu is interrupted by a brief lull as people break their fast, only to fill up again shortly after.
Such iftar tents are erected by district municipalities and give away free food with the sponsorship of private firms and individuals.
The menu is simple:
pasta, potatoes, soup, bread, water and dessert.
The majority of the people who go to Ramadan tents are usually of low income;
the rest are people who happen to be nearby at the time of breaking the fast.
The tables fill and empty quickly as several hundred people an hour benefit from the tent.
A few kilometres away, the luxury hotels of Istanbul have expensive iftar menus, which have been the topic of much public debate.
One hotel presents its fast-breaking menu as "worthy of sultans", serving various kinds of meat, vegetables and dessert.
The open buffet is 70 TL and the set menu is priced at 55 TL -- some hotels are even more expensive.
In a country where the monthly minimum wage is 600 TL, such iftar dinners have been the target of protest.
The Labour and Justice Platform (Emek ve Adalet Platformu) has organised fast breaking at parks near some of the five-star hotels every Saturday this Ramadan.
The protesters, numbering a few hundred at each event, have received media attention.
Attendees bring food from home and break their fasts picnic-style.
The point of the protests is to highlight that celebrating Ramadan at luxury hotels is in disharmony with Islam, while so many people suffer from poverty in Turkey and others are dying of hunger in Africa.

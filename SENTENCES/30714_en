STRASBOURG, France -- Several thousand Kurds gathered in Strasbourg on Saturday (February 12th) to express their support for an independent Kurdistan and urge the release of former Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been serving a lifetime sentence at a prison in Turkey since 1999.
Kurds from Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland joined the peaceful rally organised by the Federation of Kurdish Associations in France.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Judges from the UN war crimes tribunal decided on Wednesday (February 16th) to give former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic several weeks to study stacks of new documents delivered by prosecutors.
The proceedings will be suspended from March 21st to May 5th.
In all, Karadzic's team was handed more than 1,700 new documents in late January.
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from his role in the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

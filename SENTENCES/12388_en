ANKARA, Turkey -- The IMF board has decided to postpone the first review of Turkey's three-year stand-by arrangement, worth a total of $1 billion, because of the delay in social security reform, according to Anne Krueger, the Fund's first deputy managing director.
Earlier this week, parliament went on recess without endorsing the social security reform draft submitted by the government.
The deputies passed only the bill on banking reforms, whose endorsement was also required by the IMF ahead of the first review.
In other news, a former deputy leader of a pro-Kurdish party was gunned down in Diyarbakir on Wednesday (6 July).
Hikmet Fidan, 50, was vice-chairman of the People's Democracy Party, which was banned in 2003 for links to Kurdistan Workers Party terrorists.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is renewing efforts to broker a deal between Greece and Turkey that could eventually resolve the 28-year division of the island into Greek and Turkish enclaves. 
His spokesman Fred Eckhard indicated Wednesday (6 November) that Annan may push for a solution by year's end. 
Annan met earlier Wednesday with his special adviser on Cyprus and is now considering possible options. 
Negotiations between Denktash and Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides, held under auspices of the UN last month, made no significant progress, though the sides agreed to continue discussions.

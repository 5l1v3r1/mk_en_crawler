VIENNA, Austria -- In its annual report presented on Thursday (October 16th), the OSCE criticised the latest political developments in Albania.
OSCE representative in Albania Robert Bosch told the organisation's permanent council in Vienna that the Albanian government has been interfering in an investigation by prosecutors into the ammunition blasts in Gerdec that killed 26 people back in March.
The document also criticised the cabinet's work on resolving property issues and implementing election reforms.
However, the OSCE report praised Albania's efforts to strengthen economic growth and adopt a law on police.

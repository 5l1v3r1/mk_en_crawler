BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac insisted on Monday (August 24th) that any decision to scale back the number of KFOR personnel should be made in co-operation with Serbian authorities.
While acknowledging that the security situation in Kosovo has improved recently, he warned that organised crime remains a serious challenge.
Sutanovac added that any significant cut in the number of KFOR troops would be unwise.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on August 13th during a visit to Pristina that KFOR will withdraw from Kosovo only if the security situation allows it.

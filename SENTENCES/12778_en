SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Defence Minister Nikolay Svinarov said Wednesday (5 January) that Iraqi representatives would arrive in Sofia next week to discuss possible exports of Bulgarian arms to Iraq.
Svinarov said any decisions involving the sale of military equipment to the Iraqi Army would be made by an interdepartment commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Lidia Shouleva.
Also Wednesday, Labour and Social Affairs Minister Hristina Hristova met with representatives of the municipalities, employers and trade unions.
Hristova vowed that the government would work to resolve problems stemming from the planned reduction of social programmes, which sparked large protests earlier this week.

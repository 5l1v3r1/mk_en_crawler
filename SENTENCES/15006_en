SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The new High Representative to BiH, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, called for the timely implementation Wednesday (1 February) of legislation related to the country's Euro-Atlantic integration.
Addressing members of parliament at a joint session of the two chambers, Schwarz-Schilling, who took over the post from Paddy Ashdown earlier this week, said he intends to invoke the so-called "Bonn Powers" solely in cases of emergency, such as a threat to peace or the reform process.
He also reiterated that his priorities include economic development and BiH's accession into Euro-Atlantic structures.
In other news Wednesday, Senior Deputy High Representative Martin Ney criticised parliament for failing to agree on a draft law on the state ombudsman.
He warned that the issue could jeopardise BiH's Stabilisation and Association process.
Earlier in the day, a special commission tasked to harmonise two different versions of the bill, passed by parliament's two chambers in November, failed to reach a consensus.

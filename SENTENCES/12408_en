BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic called on Kosovo Serbs Thursday (9 December) to continue co-operating with the temporary institutions in Kosovo.
This was in response to an earlier statement by Kosovo Serb officials, who vowed to halt all co-operation because of allegations that Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj was involved in war crimes during the 1998-1999 conflict.
Tadic stressed that such a move would only further jeopardise the interests of Kosovo Serbs.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov has appointed former army chief Miho Mihov as the country's new ambassador to Macedonia, according to an announcement Wednesday (10 August). 
Mihov was commander of the Bulgarian armed forces from 1997-2002 and later served as military security adviser to Parvanov. 
He replaces Alexander Yordanov as ambassador.
In other news Wednesday, Parvanov issued a decree scheduling extraordinary mayoral elections in several towns and cities -- including Sofia -- for 29 October. 
The elections are required because some mayors were elected to parliament in late June, before their terms ended.

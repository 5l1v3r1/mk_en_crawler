ZAGREB, Croatia -- With Sunday's (2 January) presidential election approaching, a poll conducted by the Metron agency suggests that incumbent Stipe Mesic remains far ahead of his opponents. 
The results, presented Monday, found that Mesic has about 49.6 per cent of voter support, compared to 14 per cent for his chief rival, Jadranka Kosor of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union. 
Another 22 per cent described themselves as undecided. 
A runoff, if needed, would be held on 16 January.
The Croatian Commissariat for Refugees meanwhile said Monday that refugees from Croatia who currently live in Serbia would be able to cast their votes at six polling stations on Sunday.
In other news, police said Monday that a bomb had destroyed a monument to Josip Broz Tito in the village of Kumrovec. 
The statue was located outside the home in which the communist leader was born in 1892. 
Both the government and opposition parties in Zagreb condemned the blast, saying it was harmful to Croatia's EU integration bid.

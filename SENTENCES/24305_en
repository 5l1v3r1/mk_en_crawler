BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) is expected to release on Tuesday (May 12th) 115m euros in Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) funding, which it blocked last year because of serious violations of EU procedures. 
Meglena Plugchieva, the deputy prime minister responsible for EU funding, confirmed the move after meeting with Danuta Hubner, EU commissioner for regional development, on Monday. 
The EC reportedly relented after a substantial improvement of procedures and auditing in the state road infrastructure agency. 
The funding will clear the way for construction of the Lyulin highway, a new route that should ease congestion in Sofia and travel to the Bulgarian-Serbian border.

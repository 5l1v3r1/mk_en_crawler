BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Five former members of a Serb paramilitary unit known as the Scorpions were scheduled to go on trial at the special war crimes court in Belgrade Tuesday (20 December) for their alleged role in the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The defendants were identified from video footage of an execution of six young Muslims.
In other news, the BiH Court confirmed on Monday the prosecutorial indictment against 11 Bosnian Serbs accused of genocide in relation to the Srebrenica massacre.
They are charged with the murders of over 1,000 Bosniaks in a warehouse between Srebrenica and Bratunac on 13 July 1995.
This marks the first time that a BiH court has handed up a genocide indictment.
Also Monday, the UN tribunal announced that it has granted temporary release to former Yugoslav General Pavle Strugar on medical grounds.
Strugar, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for failing to prevent the bombardment of Dubrovnik in 1991, will undergo hip surgery in Montenegro.

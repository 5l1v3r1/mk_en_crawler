SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown is expected to meet US Secretary of State Colin Powell and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Washington on Friday (5 March).
His spokesman says Ashdown will stress the progress achieved by BiH in areas related to joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, as well as EU integration.
Following Ashdown's address to the UN Security Council earlier this week, the Council pledged full support for the reforms in BiH, stressing the country is key to regional stability.

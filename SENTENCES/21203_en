BUCHAREST, Romania -- The new head of Romanian Orthodox church, Metropolitan Daniel, was enthroned in a special ceremony on Sunday (September 30th).
President Traian Basescu attended the ceremony, as did Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu, former King Mihai, 30 international delegations and around 1,000 Orthodox faithful.
The new patriarch said he wants to preserve and expand on the legacy of predecessor Teoctist, who died of a heart attack in July.

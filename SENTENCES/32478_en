BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Defence Minister nominee Boris Tadic said Sunday (16 March) that he will embark on a national army reform once he is in office. 
An emergency session of the Democratic Party nominated Tadic to the new federal post. 
As priorities, he cited changes in personnel and the chain of command. 
Concerning the latter, he said he plans to make army headquarters report to the defence ministry, which in turn would be accountable to parliament and the Supreme Defence Council. 
He added that the issue of command was not well defined in the constitutional charter and that it should be amended.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Around 20 top cases dealing with corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking and misappropriation of state funds will be completed by the end of November at the latest, according to an announcement following a meeting between Interior Minister Rumen Petkov and Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev on Wednesday (October 4th).
They also agreed that while collaboration between their organisations is solid, more should be done to improve co-operation from other state institutions such as the Commission for Confiscation of Property and the Agency for Financial Investigation.
In other news Wednesday, parliament's presidency council concluded that lawmakers could not remove Dimitar Stoyanov -- of the ultranationalist Attack coalition -- from his position as observer at the European Parliament (EP).
At issue were controversial remarks he made last week regarding a Hungarian Roma EP deputy, Livia Jaroka.
Earlier this week, EP President Josep Borrell Fontelles demanded that Stoyanov apologise to Jaroka.

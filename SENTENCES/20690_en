TIRANA, Albania -- US Ambassador to NATO Victoria Nuland told a press conference at the US Embassy in Tirana on Wednesday (November 7th) that Albania should work harder for an invitation to join NATO.
Nuland acknowledged that the Albanian government has made some progress, but said much remains to be done in the fight against corruption and in the field of judicial and electoral reforms.
She reiterated that with peacekeeping troops deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and Iraq, Albania has proved to be an exporter of security, but it lags behind in terms of domestic reforms.
In other news Wednesday, Albanian Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli met with European Parliament President Hans Gert Poettering in Brussels.
He also encouraged the country to continue its anti-graft and judicial reform efforts.

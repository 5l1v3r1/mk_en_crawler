SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Ambassador to Skopje Erwan Fouere on called on the opposition Tuesday (July 29th) to return to parliament as soon as possible.
The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), the Liberal Democratic Party, the New Social Democratic Party and the New Alternative party, all members of the Sun coalition, decided to boycott parliamentary sessions following the arrest of SDSM Vice President and Strumica Mayor Zoran Zaev.
Prosecutors say he abused his power during a tender for a local shopping mall.
Fouere said the boycott undermines the work of ruling institutions and will drive off foreign investors.
"This is a disease that should be eradicated in Macedonia," Fouere said after meeting with Ivica Bocevski, deputy prime minister responsible for European affairs.

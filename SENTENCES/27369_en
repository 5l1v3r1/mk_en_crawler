PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU Special Representative for Kosovo Pieter Feith, who also heads the International Civilian Office in Pristina, says the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will issue its nonbinding ruling on the legality of Kosovo's independence by the end of July, media reports said Thursday (May 27th).
Serbia filed the challenge before the ICJ.
In a speech at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, Feith predicted countries will continue to recognise Kosovo's independence and said he hopes the ruling "can encourage Kosovo and Serbia to be more fully engaged in the solving of technical issues".

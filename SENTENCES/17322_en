STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- The government has refused to pardon and release former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving an 11-year sentence for her role in war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Officials rejected her plea for release but provided no details. 
Plavsic, 76, has been serving her sentence in a Swedish women's prison since 2003. 
She sought amnesty, citing health issues. 
The judges at the UN war crimes tribunal had given her a relatively short sentence because she surrendered voluntarily to the court and expressed remorse for her actions when pleading guilty.

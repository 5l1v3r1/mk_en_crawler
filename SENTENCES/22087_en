ZAGREB, Croatia -- The human rights group Amnesty International said Tuesday (April 15th) that the EU should press Croatia to boost its prosecution of war criminals.
Irene Khan, the head of the organisation, said Brussels should act to ensure that all war criminals are tried regardless of ethnicity.
She said Croatian courts continue to show ethnic bias, with their attention primarily geared to crimes committed by ethnic Serbs, while crimes committed by ethnic Croats remain unaddressed.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Wednesday (November 11th) asked the UN war crimes tribunal to allow him to lodge an appeal against the court's decision to appoint him a lawyer.
The tribunal decided last week to appoint an attorney who will represent Karadzic if he refuses to appear in court.
Karadzic, who is representing himself and has boycotted the start of the proceedings, argues that three months will not be enough for any lawyer to get up to speed in such a complicated case.
He also challenged the fact that judges did not allow him to choose a lawyer from among those working for the court.
According to tribunal rules, the court must approve appeals before they can be considered.
Karadzic's trial has been suspended until March 1st 2010.

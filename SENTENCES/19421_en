PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- In a statement Tuesday (October 30th), the OSCE Mission in Kosovo expressed concern over how the province's judicial authorities handle human-trafficking cases that come before the courts. 
The OSCE presented a report that highlighted the most frequent problems: trafficking victims do not receive basic guarantees provided by law, and sometimes are themselves threatened with prosecution. 
There is also a failure to identify or appropriately treat trafficking victims, apply adequate witness protection measures, and to fully understand all issues related to trafficking.

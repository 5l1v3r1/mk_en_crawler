ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Constitutional Court on Wednesday (October 20th) unanimously ruled that there is no need to hold a referendum on possible changes to the labour law, as the government has already withdrawn its proposal on the issue. 
The court concluded that by withdrawing the amendments from parliamentary procedure, the cabinet has respected the will of citizens who signed a petition, organised by trade unions, requesting a referendum on the controversial proposals. 
Among them was one that would have set a six-month deadline for hammering out a new collective agreement after the existing one expires. 
After that, workers' rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers. 
Unions had collected more than 700,000 signatures required to call a referendum on the proposed amendments. 
They say they are considering their next move, in light of the ruling.

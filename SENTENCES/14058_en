SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling urged BiH authorities on Wednesday (15 February) to proceed quickly with plans to reform voter registration, in time for the autumn general elections. 
BiH is working to install a Citizens Identification Protection System, which would register voters automatically via a database. 
This is expected to simplify the registration process and boost turnout.

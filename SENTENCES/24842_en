PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A small group of Serbs gathered outside the entrance of the District Court in northern Mitrovica on Monday (March 2nd), blocking the work of EULEX judges and prosecutors on their first day in the building. 
A panel of three EULEX judges wanted to review a criminal case related to an October 2007 robbery in the northern Leposavic region. 
Protestors said they opposed the application of Kosovo laws and the use of Kosovo stamps in official court documents. 
The court has not rescheduled the session.

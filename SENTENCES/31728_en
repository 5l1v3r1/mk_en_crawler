BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romania's delegation successfully concluded the second round of membership talks with NATO on Thursday (9 January), according to officials. 
Negotiations outlined a concrete set of reforms aiming to harmonise Romania's defence legislation with NATO standards. 
A NATO delegation will visit Bucharest later this month to work on a timetable. 
The alliance hopes to complete the entire membership process for the seven newly invited countries by May 2004.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday the IMF executive board discussed Romania's economy, praising the ongoing structural reforms and recent positive macroeconomic indicators. 
In March, the IMF executive board is expected to approve the next tranche under the credit arrangement with Romania.

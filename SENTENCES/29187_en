BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) failed to bring Albania's political parties together Tuesday (May 4th) for dialogue aimed at ending the country's political crisis.
After two days of meetings in Brussels, the EU-Albania Parliamentary Committee was unable to adopt a regular resolution as happened in previous meetings.
The head of the Balkan delegation at the EP, Eduard Kukan, said "the political stalemate was evident here at the European Parliament ...
I am disappointed, since for the first time a meeting of such nature ends in this situation." Romanian EP member Victor Bostinaru said the situation sets a precedent.
"It is alarming that the EP that does not meet readiness from the sides in Albania to work together for the European future of the country.
We here co-operate, while our Albanian colleagues don't," said Bostinaru.
Some opposition party members in Tirana resorted this week to staging a hunger strike, until the ruling Democratic Party agrees to open ballot boxes from the June 2009 general elections.
The opposition has insisted for months that the results were manipulated.

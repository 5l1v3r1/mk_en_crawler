SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ambassadors of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) steering board in BiH issued a joint statement on Monday (8 May), calling for the continuation of crucial police reform. 
They particularly urged all sides to remain fully engaged in the work of the police reform directorate, voicing their regret over the fact that the latest session, last week, did not result in a compromise on the future structure of the police forces. 
Restructuring is a key condition for concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the EU. 
The next round of SAA negotiations is scheduled for Friday.

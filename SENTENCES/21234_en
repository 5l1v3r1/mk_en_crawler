ANKARA, Turkey -- Lawmakers late Tuesday (April 29th) approved amendments to a controversial article of the penal code that the EU and others had criticised for limiting freedom of expression. 
The amendments to Article 301 passed by a vote of 250-65 after an eight-hour debate. 
The phrase "Turkishness" in the legislation will be replaced by the "Turkish nation", and the word "republic" gives way to the "State of the Republic of Turkey". 
Lawmakers also agreed that the punishment for insulting the Turkish people, republic, national assembly or legislative and military authorities will decrease from three years to no more than two years in prison. 
Opening an investigation of an alleged offence requires approval by the justice minister.

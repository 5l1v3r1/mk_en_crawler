TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian gangs are among the most dangerous and most active in drugs and weapons trafficking, according to EUROPOL's latest report on the organised crime threat in the EU bloc, published on Wednesday (May 4th). 
The document says that Albanian and Lithuanian gangs have built criminal businesses and are strengthening a string of illegal trades.
"Of all the hubs, the South East has seen the greatest expansion in recent years, as a result of increased trafficking via the Black Sea, proliferation of numerous Balkan routes for illicit commodities to and from the EU, and a significant increase in illegal immigration via Greece," the report pointed out. 
"These developments in the region have contributed to the formation of a Balkan axis for trafficking to the EU, consisting of the Western Balkans and South East Europe. 
New transit hubs are in the process of being formed in countries such as Hungary, where several Balkan and Black Sea routes converge," it added.

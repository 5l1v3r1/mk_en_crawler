TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE urged Albanian news organisations Wednesday (7 July) to strive for more independent reporting, warning that bias has compromised their credibility. 
Osmo Lipponen, the chief of the OSCE mission in the country, said Albanians have become "very sceptical towards the truth as presented by the media". 
Speaking to a meeting of Albanian publishers and editors-in-chief, Lipponen stressed that "editorial policy should not be dictated only by narrow interests of the owners, the politicians they support or the big advertisers." He attributed a drop in newspaper readership to lost credibility.

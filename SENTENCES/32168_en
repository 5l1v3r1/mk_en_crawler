SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a letter to the new joint presidency sent Tuesday (12 November), High Representative Paddy Ashdown warned that changes proposed at its first session would undo progress achieved during the presidency's last mandate towards creating an effective and united institution. 
The proposal suggested the return of separate secretariats in BiH, an idea Ashdown says would undermine the clear lines of responsibility in the organisational structure of the joint secretariat. 
The joint secretariat, Ashdown stressed, is a requirement of the EU Road Map.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal announced that it is consolidating its two indictments against Gen Ratko Mladic, originally filed in 1995, leaving only the most serious charges allegedly committed during the BiH conflict. 
The move will provide an appropriate basis for a motion of joinder, given the amended indictment against Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu rejected on Sunday (June 24th) findings by Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) rapporteur Dick Marty that suggested that Romania hosted secret CIA detention centres from 2003 to 2005. 
The report, presented by Marty on June 8th, said the CIA established secret prisons in Romania and Poland, where it questioned alleged terrorists. 
The prisons were allegedly set up under a secret deal among NATO allies reached in October 2001, shortly after the September 11th attacks.
The document also suggested that the centres opened with the approval of the two Eastern European countries' presidents and institutions, including Pascu. 
Romanian authorities deny the allegations, insisting Marty lacks evidence to support his claims. 
Amnesty International is urging Romania and Poland to investigate.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A UNMIK spokesman told reporters Thursday (11 December) that a decision by the Kosovo Parliament to annul all laws passed since 1989 had no validity.
Hua Jiang said the international community does not recognise the local lawmakers' action because law and order remain in the hands of UNMIK, under UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Earlier in the day, the assembly in Pristina voted to annul laws adopted after Slobodan Milosevic came to power, arguing that they had violated the will of the ethnic Albanian majority and hindered Kosovo's development.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Speaking late Thursday (24 April), Federal Defence Minister Borislav Tadic said reforms in the Yugoslav Army could be completed by 2010. 
Tadic said he is convinced that the army is ready to start profound restructuring, adding that he will call on international organisations to provide technical and financial assistance. 
A 50,000-man army would be preferable to the current 78,000, he said.
Addressing another issue, Tadic said an investigation is underway to establish whether some officials have protected former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic. 
He says the international community demands full clarity.

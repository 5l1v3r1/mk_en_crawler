SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An estimated 3,000 tobacco farmers blocked one of Bulgaria's main highways Monday (December 21st) to protest subsidy cuts planned next year.
They also complained they have not received crucial payments for this year.
They used tractors to block the Trakia highway, connecting Sofia and Istanbul.
In all, there are about 40,000 registered tobacco producers in Bulgaria and 150,000 people working in the sector.
In other news Monday, the Order, Law, Justice (RZS) party withdrew its support from the GERB-led government.
"We will become a conservative right-wing opposition party," chairman Yane Yanev announced.
The RZS was the smallest party in parliament even before one of its members it left this month.
GERB won't be affected by RZS's move, given its informal coalition with Attack and the Blue Coalition.

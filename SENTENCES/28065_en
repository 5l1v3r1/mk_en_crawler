BUCHAREST, Romania -- One of the country's best known journalists was arrested on Tuesday (June 22nd) along with his producer on charges of blackmailing and threatening a mayor. 
Dan Diaconescu and producer Doru Parv are suspected of demanding money from Ion Motz, mayor of the village of Zarand, in return for not broadcasting compromising material about him. 
Motz says he paid the pair 30,000 euros, a fraction of the 200,000 euros they demanded. 
Diaconescu, owner of local OTV channel, denies the charges.

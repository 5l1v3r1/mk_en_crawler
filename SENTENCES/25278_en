SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The foreign ministry has summoned the head of Greece's liaison office in Skopje, Alexandra Papadopoulou, for talks Monday (March 29th) following graphic anti-Macedonian slogans chanted during a military parade in Athens. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Zoran Petrov will hand Papadopoulou a note of protest demanding a formal apology. 
Government spokesman Martin Martinovski told a press conference Sunday that hate speech does not contribute to good neighbourly relations. 
Greek soldiers allegedly chanted "They are Skopjans, they are Albanians, we will make new clothes out of their skins" during a parade marking Greece's national holiday on Thursday. 
Greek Civil Protection Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis has ordered an investigation.
The chants also sparked a reaction in Tirana, where thousands protested on Saturday outside the Greek Embassy.

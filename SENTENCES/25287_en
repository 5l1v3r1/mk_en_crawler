BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Libyan national was attacked Friday (September 25th) in a park in Belgrade and ended up with a minor head injury.
The attack followed a series of similar incidents against foreigners believed to be carried out by nationalists.
Police are searching for the assailants.
On Friday, prosecutors moved to ban two ultranationalist groups -- Obraz (Honour) and the Serb Popular Movement 1389 for inciting hatred, xenophobia, and homophobia.
In reaction to the latest surge of extremism, Police Director Milorad Veljovic is urging all citizens to refrain from violence, stressing that police will not tolerate any violation of the public order.
State Secretary for Tourism Goran Petkovic warns that attacks against foreigners could seriously damage Serbia's image in the world.

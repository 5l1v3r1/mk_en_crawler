LONDON, United Kingdom -- Negotiations to reunify Cyprus have a new momentum and must be encouraged, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Thursday (22 January) during a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The positive momentum was created by the elections in the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and statements by Turkey declaring its desire to resume negotiations based on UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's peace plan.
The effort may get another boost next week, when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan meets with US President George W. Bush.
Papandreou and Blair also discussed political developments in Greece.
Later, Papandreou met with his British counterpart, Jack Straw, and then left for Germany to meet with Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The number of public servants is down by about 100,000 and will fall to below 1.29 million people by the end of the year , Prime Minister Emil Boc said in a TV interview on Sunday (December 12th). 
The layoffs, he added, will continue next year. 
Under its agreement with the IMF, Bucharest must cut 88,000 vacant jobs in the public sector, and maintain a hiring freeze. 
Moreover, the cabinet enacted a 25% cut in public sector wages, and cancelled all bonuses and other grants as part of the austerity measures implemented in July. 
The cabinet is set to start discussing a new agreement with the IMF on January 20th when a Fund review mission visits Bucharest, Boc said on Sunday. 
He added that the new agreement would most likely be a precautionary one, without a pre-established value. 
Romania is currently under a 12.95 billion-euro stand-by agreement for two years, but the total financing package from the IMF, EU and the World Bank totals almost 20 billion euros. 
The present agreement ends next year.

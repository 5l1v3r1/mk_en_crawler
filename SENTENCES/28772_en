THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has rejected a request for the provisional release of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who is facing a partial retrial, his lawyer, Michael O'Reilly, said on Friday (September 10th). 
Haradinaj and two fellow former Kosovo Liberation Army members -- Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj -- were recalled for partial retrial in July. 
The three originally were prosecuted in 2008 on charges of crimes against Serbs or their collaborators in 1998. 
Haradinaj and Balaj were acquitted, while Brahimaj was convicted of torture and sentenced to six years. 
The three are now in custody at The Hague's Detention Unit awaiting a retrial date.

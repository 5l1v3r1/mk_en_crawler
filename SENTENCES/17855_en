BUCHAREST, Romania -- A parliamentary inquiry commission, established at the opposition's request, decided on Wednesday (March 21st) that President Traian Basescu should face impeachment for exceeding his constitutional powers. 
The decision followed three weeks of tense accusations which, among other things, led to the resignation of the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service. 
The panel based its decision on a series of actions, including Basescu's refusal to approve ministers proposed by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, alleged illegal telephone tapping, and alleged attempts to influence prosecutors' probes. 
The panel's decision will now be debated by the full Parliament.
Tariceanu, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday that he would temporarily assume the post of foreign minister, since Basescu has not approved his nominee, Senator Adrian Cioroianu, to the post. 
It has been vacant since Mihai Razvan Ungureanu's resignation earlier this year.

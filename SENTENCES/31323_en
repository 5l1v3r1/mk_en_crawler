TIRANA, Albania -- The low level of education in Albania is hindering economic growth, according to a new report by the World Bank, quoted by local media on Monday (November 30th). 
Albania has fewer educated employees compared to developed countries and countries in the region, the document concluded. 
Currently, Albania has the lowest number of high school graduates -- 48.7% compared to 62% in the Balkans. 
By the end of 2009, more than half of the big companies in the country cited lack of knowledge among their employees as their biggest barrier. 
The World Bank said this is critical, as companies are the catalyst for potential future economic growth. 
Albania is spending less on education, the report noted, and ten times less on scientific research than EU countries.

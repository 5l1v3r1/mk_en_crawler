SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) says it will hold Republika Srpska's (RS) relevant institutions responsible if BiH is not invited to join NATO's Partnership for Peace later this month. 
"BiH cannot be held hostage by RS's failures," OHR spokesman Mario Brkic said on Tuesday (1 June).
In other news, the OHR has given several cantons in the Federation of BiH until Friday to harmonise cantonal legislation with the state law on primary and secondary education. 
Sanctions would be imposed if the cantons fail to meet the deadline.
SFOR, meanwhile, says it has completed its vetting process on candidates for generals in the future BiH armed forces. 
The nominees have been forwarded to the government for further consideration.

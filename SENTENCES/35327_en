ATHENS, Greece -- The public works ministry said Tuesday (17 February) that new delays in completing four venues would not affect the Summer Olympics.
The complex that will host the basketball, handball and fencing competitions was originally scheduled for completion in January.
It will now be completed in May.
The canoe slalom centre will be finished at the end of May, a delay of three months.
Construction of the venue for the badminton and modern pentathlon competitions is about 30 days behind schedule and will be completed at the end of April.
Organisers may also abandon plans to build a roof over the swimming stadium because the contractor would be unable to complete it on time.
In other news, about 500 protesters blocked traffic in downtown Athens on Tuesday, demanding an easing of security measures during the Games.
The crowd dispersed when it reached parliament.

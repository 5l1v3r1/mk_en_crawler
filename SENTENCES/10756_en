ZAGREB, Croatia -- UNICEF and the Croatian government signed an agreement Thursday (7 October) to implement a joint project aimed at preventing school violence.
Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor estimates 100,000 children are exposed to such violence every day, while 20 per cent are targeted two to three times during childhood.
In its latest report, Amnesty International voiced concern over violence and bullying among children and adolescents in the care of public institutions.
It also noted a failure to integrate Roma children into the education system.

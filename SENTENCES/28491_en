ZAGREB, Croatia -- The leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), Zoran Milanovic, called on Wednesday (April 14th) for more negotiations on constitutional amendments.
He criticised the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) for its unwillingness to compromise and warned this could jeopardise the country's EU accession negotiations.
Essentially, the only remaining issue is the Diaspora vote:
the SDP insists that voting should be restricted to diplomatic-consular missions, while the HDZ disagrees.
SDP support is critical, as amendments requires support from two-thirds of lawmakers.
Deputy Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks says that if the SDP is unwilling to compromise on the expatriate vote, then that issue will be dropped for now and only the ones required by the EU would be considered.

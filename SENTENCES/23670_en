SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), currently the largest right-wing party in parliament, elected lawmaker Martin Dimitrov, 31, as its new leader Sunday (December 21st), succeeding Plamen Yurukov.
In the second round of voting, Dimitrov received about 4,300 ballots, compared to 2,800 for the other candidate, former Trade Minister Rumen Hristov.
This marked the first time members of a major political party elected its leadership directly.
In other news Sunday, Volen Siderov won re-election as leader of the extreme right party Ataka.
Of over 500 delegates attending the party convention, only one, former deputy leader Anton Sirakov, voted against Siderov, arguing he had changed Ataka's original policy.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The District Court for War Crimes acquitted a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) on Thursday (December 20th).
Sinan Morina faced charges stemming from the 1998 persecution, rape and torture of Serb civilians in the Kosovo village of Opterusa.
Presiding Judge Olivera Andjelkovic said insufficient evidence was presented to convict the defendant.
Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic vows to appeal that verdict.
Another 33 former KLA members face charges in the same case.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU will reach agreement by Friday (17 December) on launching accession talks with Turkey, Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Gerrit Zalm said in an interview published Thursday.
He cautioned, however, that this would not guarantee a successful outcome to the negotiations.
Zalm's statement was echoed by Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, who said Friday's summit would give a green light to the start of negotiations, adding that these could take many years to complete.

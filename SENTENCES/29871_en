TIRANA, Albania -- A population census planned for April has been officially postponed to avoid overlapping with campaigning ahead of the May 8th local elections.
The census may take place in the autumn instead, the ministry for innovation announced on Sunday (February 27th).
The census is expected to cost 15m euros.

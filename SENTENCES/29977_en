ANKARA, Turkey -- Necmettin Erbakan, the country's first Islamist prime minister, died in Ankara on Sunday (February 27th).
He was 84.
Erbakan was hospitalised early in January with what has been reported as a foot infection.
He spent one year as prime minister before the military pressed him to step down in 1997.
He has since been charged with falsifying documents of his Welfare Party and hiding millions in reserves ordered seized after the party was shut down in 1998 on charges of being a focus of Islamic militancy.
Erbakan was barred from politics for five years for violating the constitution.
The ruling Justice and Development Party grew out of the Welfare Party.
In recent years, Erbakan had served as the leader of the small Felicity Party.
His funeral will be held in Istanbul on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Washington on Monday (November 29th) to discuss a series of issues, including the recent massive leak of US documents in WikiLeaks.
"The foreign minister appreciated the direct and candid comments the secretary provided," State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley told journalists after the closed-door discussions.
Davutoglu said that Turkey continues to maintain its "strategic partnership" with the United States.
Clinton said "Turkey and the US have one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world." WikiLeaks recently published over 250,000 documents, including 7,018 cables allegedly from the US Embassy in Ankara.
Clinton said on Monday that Washington "deeply regrets the disclosure of any information that was intended to be confidential", and expressed confidence that "the partnerships and relationships that we have built in this administration will withstand this challenge."

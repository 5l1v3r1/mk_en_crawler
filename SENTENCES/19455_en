ANKARA, Turkey -- A law allowing women to wear headscarves in universities entered into force in Turkey on Saturday (February 23rd), after President Abdullah Gul approved the constitutional amendments on Friday allowing the change. 
The main opposition secular Republican People's Party (CHP) has announced it will insist the Constitutional Court cancel the legislation.

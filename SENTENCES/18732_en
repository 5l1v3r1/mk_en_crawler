SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Ambassador to Skopje Gillian Milovanovic met with Ali Ahmeti, leader of the major ethnic Albanian opposition party Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), on Wednesday (February 7th). 
Though no official statements were made afterwards, local media reports suggest it was part of an effort by the international community to persuade DUI and its coalition ally, the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), to end their boycott of Parliament. 
A few weeks ago, DUI and PDP stopped participating in the legislature, accusing the ruling coalition of ignoring the principles of the Ohrid Peace Accords, especially those regarding adoption of laws concerning the ethnic Albanian community. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn visited Skopje to discuss the matter Thursday.

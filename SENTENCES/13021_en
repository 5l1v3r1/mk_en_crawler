SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Parliament's House of Representatives endorsed in the first reading Wednesday (28 September) the laws on BiH defence and service in the armed forces.
The package provides legal grounds for the implementation of crucial defence reforms that would establish a single chain of military command and a single, professional army as of 2006.
Also Wednesday, the EU member states' ambassadors to BiH issued a joint statement warning that Republika Srpska (RS) must either embrace key police reforms or risk full isolation.
They reiterated that the restructuring of the police sector in BiH is a main prerequisite for EU integration.

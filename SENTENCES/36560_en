ANKARA, Turkey -- The Office of the Chief of General Staff issued an official statement Thursday (6 May) criticising the government-proposed education reform bill. 
It aims to remove barriers faced by vocational high school graduates, facilitating the recruitment of religious school graduates in the state administration. 
The military insists the proposed bill violates existing laws, will harm the principle of unity of education, and violates secular education principles.

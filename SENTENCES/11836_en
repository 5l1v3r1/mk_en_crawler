BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer on Thursday (17 March) urged the government and people of Macedonia to make sure that the second round of local elections "meets the highest democratic standards". 
He reminded Skopje that any country aspiring to membership in the Northern Alliance is expected to meet these benchmarks. 
De Hoop Scheffer voiced concern about "serious irregularities" in western Macedonia during the first round of elections on 13 March, contrasting with what he described as "generally orderly" voting elsewhere in the country. 
The second round will be held on 27 March. 
Separately, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said Thursday the cabinet is investigating those irregularities, adding that charges have been filed against 19 people.

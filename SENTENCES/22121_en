PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN General Committee on Wednesday (September 17th) gave Serbia the green light in its bid to present arguments against Kosovo's independence. 
Serbia will try to convince the General Assembly that Kosovo's declaration of independence was illegal and that the UN must seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). 
In response, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said "nobody should be surprised with Serbia's initiatives â¦ but Serbia's efforts cannot impede Kosovo's progress". 
He urged UN member states to oppose the initiative.
In other news Wednesday, UNMIK spokesperson Alexander Ivanko said that seven months after it ceased operation, the court in northern Mitrovica is ready to resume work. 
It will reopen at the beginning of October.
Also Wednesday, KFOR expressed its readiness to intervene in any case, if it receives a request from UNMIK or from Kosovo institutions.

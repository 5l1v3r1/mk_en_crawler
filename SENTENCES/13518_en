ZAGREB, Croatia -- The parliamentary committee investigating alleged misappropriation by former Construction Minister Radimir Cacic concluded on Wednesday (24 August) that he had helped certain firms obtain procurement contracts from 2000-2003.
The panel also investigated allegations against former Parliament Speaker Zlatko Tomcic, who leads the Croatian Farmers' Party.
The commission says it found no evidence that Tomcic was involved in any conflict of interest.
The media previously speculated that a local company, in which Tomcic held a 22 per cent stake, had been improperly granted some contracts during that period.
In other news Wednesday, a sixth Croatian contingent left for Kabul to serve as part of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.
That same day, Croatia sent a four-member team to Afghanistan as part of a joint medical team composed also of personnel from Albania and Macedonia.

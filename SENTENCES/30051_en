WASHINGTON, United States -- IMF and Greek officials on Saturday (April 16th) rejected media reports that suggested Greece's debt could undergo restructuring.
On the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank spring meeting in Washington, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that nothing has changed in regards to the bailout programme.
Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou confirmed that there are no plans for renegotiating the debt.
On Friday, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou again voiced his government's determination to continue with structural reforms, ruling out both early general elections and debt restructuring.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Thousands gathered at Istanbul's Taksim Square to mark International Labour Day on Saturday (May 1st), for the first time in 33 years. 
Celebrations had been banned since 1977, when gunmen opened fire on a crowd gathered there, killing dozens of people. 
More than 22,000 police officers were mobilised to prevent trouble this time. 
Organisers -- including trade unions, political parties and NGOs -- estimate nearly 300,000 turned out, demanding jobs, better working conditions and higher salaries.

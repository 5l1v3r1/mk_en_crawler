SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH presidency member Sulejman Tihic said during talks with a NATO delegation that SFOR should continue until defence reforms are completed and the Dayton Agreement is fully implemented.
Reportedly, the talks also focused on possibilities for a reduction of SFOR troops.
Other options for restructuring of the mission include larger involvement of EU authorities.

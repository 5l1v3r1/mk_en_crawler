BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government decided to shut down its nuclear reactor at Cernavoda on Friday (22 August) as the level of the Danube reached its lowest point in more than a century.
The special procedure began Friday evening when it became apparent that there was not enough water to cool the unit.
The 750-megawatt reactor was to be shut down completely by midnight Saturday and will remain closed until the Danube rises to normal levels.
Government officials say they will boost the output of coal-burning power stations to offset the loss of capacity.
The Cernavoda reactor produces 10 per cent of Romania's electricity.

TIRANA, Albania -- The longstanding political deadlock threatens Albania's European perspective, Eduard Kukan, head of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Southest Europe, was quoted as saying on Thursday (February 17th). 
Deutsche Welle says Kukan confirmed that the debate held at the European Parliament earlier in the week on Albania was constructive and demonstrated politicians' determination to solve the crisis. 
He stressed, however, that preparations for the May local elections must get off the ground, and the OSCE's recommendations on the Elections Code must be addressed.
Meanwhile, the opposition Socialist Party returns on Friday to Tirana's main square for another protest against the government. 
The party says this one will be peaceful, unlike the one on January 21st.

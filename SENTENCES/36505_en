WASHINGTON, United States -- White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice praised Greece on Sunday (8 August) for working "very, very hard" to make the Olympics safe.
She acknowledged the enormous resources that have been put into security, as well as Greece's close co-operation with the United States and NATO.
Athens Organising Committee chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki told reporters after a meeting with the International Olympic Committee on Sunday that Athens is ready to host the Olympics.
"Venues are ready.
Our people are ready .The tram, the suburban rail and Olympic lanes are working.
The athletes of the world are training in our facilities," she said.
Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia, who co-ordinated Olympic preparations, said Sunday the government had no concerns about security since everything humanly possible had been done.
"The Greek people are going to spend $1.2 billion for security.
We know that the world has changed since 11 September 2001, and we are collaborating with all the countries all over the world.
We have the contribution of NATO and we are ready for a secure Games," she said.
The new airport security systems in Athens passed their first test on Sunday when gate agents prevented a man carrying a loaded gun from boarding a flight to Lesvos.
The pen-like device had a single 22mm bullet in its chamber.
The offender was described as a Greek national.
Sales of Olympic tickets have picked up, organisers of the Games reported Sunday.
They have been announcing record sales every day since 2 August.
Approximately 54,000 tickets were sold Friday.
Ticket sales averaged just 4,500 per day in June.

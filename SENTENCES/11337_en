BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey is expected to formally extend its customs treaty with the EU to Cyprus on Wednesday (27 July), media reports said, quoting EU diplomatic sources. 
Ambassadors to the EU will countersign the document on the same day. 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has not confirmed the reports. 
Signing the treaty is the final condition Ankara must fulfil before it can start accession talks with the EU on 3 October. 
According to Reuters, Turkey will issue a statement that the customs treaty does not amount to formal recognition of Cyprus.
Also on Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet with his British counterpart, Tony Blair, in London. 
The Cyprus issue is expected to be one of the main topics on the agenda. 
Britain currently presides over the EU.

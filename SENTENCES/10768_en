ANKARA, Turkey -- The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is offering to co-operate with the government to speed up EU accession. 
CHP head Deniz Baykal said Thursday (7 October) that his party would support the government in addressing clauses in the EU report that the party finds restrictive. 
Earlier this week, the European Commission recommended the EU open accession negotiations with Turkey but said the talks would be suspended if the country backtracks on reforms.
Also Thursday, Bulent Arinc was re-elected parliament speaker, but only after a rival from the Justice and Development Party pulled out of the race. 
He failed to get the required support of two-thirds of the 520 lawmakers in two rounds of voting until Serpil Yildiz, one of few women deputies in the ruling party, quit the contest. 
The CHP did not nominate a candidate.
In other news, a bomb exploded outside the Istanbul residence of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the highest authority in the Eastern Orthodox Church. 
It caused minor damage but no injuries.

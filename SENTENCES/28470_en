ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Friday (August 13th) announced a unilateral ceasefire for the month of Ramadan.
Bouzan Teken, one of the group's leaders, told a press conference in the Kandil Mountain that the rebels will halt operations inside Turkey, but will defend themselves if attacked by the Turkish Army.
"We believe that a ceasefire at this time might have positive results towards developing a political and peaceful solution," Teken said.
The ceasefire will last until September 20th, he explained, adding that the PKK has demanded Ankara release 1,700 Kurdish politicians that he says are currently being detained in Turkish prisons.
Sunday marks the 26th anniversary of the conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives since it began in 1984.
In other news, al-Qaeda number two man Ayman al-Zawahiri said in an audio message posted on a militant website Sunday that Turkey should stop co-operating with Israel.
In the 20-minute message, al-Zawahiri stated that the Turkish government is demonstrating sympathy for the Palestinians on one hand by sending aid shipments, but is at the same time co-operating with the Israeli military.
He also urged Turkey to stop killing Muslims in Afghanistan.

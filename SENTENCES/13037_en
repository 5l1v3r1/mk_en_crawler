NESSEBAR, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) plans to propose the launch of a special parliamentary inquiry commission to tackle legal and other problems related to properties of the former king, Simeon Saxe-Coburg, who now leads the ruling coalition partner NMS-II.
At a BSP party seminar in Nessebar on Sunday (26 February), party officials stressed that they want an impartial and thorough examination of the issue.
Allegations of misappropriation in the restitution process have dogged Saxe-Coburg since he returned to Bulgaria and sought to reclaim family properties that were nationalised by the Communist regime in the 1940s.

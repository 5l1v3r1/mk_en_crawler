BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor on Wednesday (December 5th) dropped charges against retired Yugoslav National Army (JNA) officer Vladimir Kovacevic, a man dubbed "Rambo" who is accused of committing war crimes against civilians in Dubrovnik in December 1991. 
Two civilians died and three were injured in an attack. 
Kovacevic was declared unfit to stand trial because of a mental disorder. 
His case had been transferred to Serbian courts after he was declared unfit for trial by experts at The Hague war crimes tribunal.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko announced on Saturday (June 20th) he is repealing a resolution by Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament, obliging the entity's institutions and officials to oppose any future transfer of power to BiH.
In a statement published on the Office of the High Representative's (OHR) website, Inzko said the resolution violates both the Dayton Peace Agreement and BiH's constitution, as it undermines BiH's exclusive competencies.
Inzko's move came after he met RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic to discuss the controversial resolution.
Dodik criticised Inzko's decision, saying it "is designed to suspend basic human and democratic freedoms".
In other news Friday, BiH Presidency chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic called for the OHR to be replaced by a Special Representative of the EU.
"The transformation ...
would be a clear sign that BiH can compete on an equal footing with other countries from the region in the Euro-Atlantic integration process as a sovereign, democratic state, without the OHR," Radmanovic said on the sidelines of the Central European summit in Novi Sad, Serbia.

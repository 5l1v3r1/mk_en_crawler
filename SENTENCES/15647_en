SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev said on Wednesday (October 25th) that he has asked the High Judicial Council to lift the immunity of two more regional magistrates -- Toni Tomov and Karen Beylerian from Varna -- so they can be investigated for alleged violations. 
These apparently surfaced during a recent internal investigation of all prosecutors.

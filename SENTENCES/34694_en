SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The foreign ministry announced on Tuesday (19 August) that Bulgaria and the United Kingdom have drafted a resolution on Libya and submitted it to the UN Security Council. 
The document stipulates the lifting of sanctions against Libya, imposed 11 years ago following the 1988 Lockerbie terrorist attack that killed 270 people. 
Libya recently pledged to compensate the victims' relatives. 
France, which is among the countries with a right to veto the resolution, threatened to do so if Libya does not agree to compensate the victims of the 1989 terrorist attack against a French airliner over Niger.

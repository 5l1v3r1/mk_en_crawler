ANKARA, Turkey -- A mortar attack caused the explosions near a municipal building in Istanbul on Thursday (August 7th), security sources said. 
The attack in Istanbul's Uskudar district actually targeted army headquarters, and not the municipal building, as earlier reported. 
Four mortar rounds were fired from a cemetery, almost 500m from the army building, a local news agency reported. 
Three workers were slightly injured in the attack and taken to hospital, said Istanbul Police Chief Celalettin Cerrah. 
Police are searching for two people spotted leaving the scene by motorcycle, news agencies reported.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey is ready for full democracy and should not accept an inadequate understanding of democratic concepts, Turkish Prime Minister and Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday (14 August).
In a speech marking the 2nd anniversary of the AKP's founding, he stressed that the EU membership process requires society to give up misunderstandings about democracy.
Erdogan said that Turkey has largely overcome security problems, adding that a new era of peace has begun with the adoption of the Rehabilitation Law, which grants amnesty to most rebels.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government denounced Wednesday's (July 18th) suicide bombing attack on a Turkish military convoy in Afghanistan, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility.
Two people were injured, one Turkish security guard and one civilian.
Turkey vowed to continue its support for Afghanistan and its contribution to stabilisation and security in the region.
In other news Wednesday, Iraqi officials accused the Turkish military of firing up to 100 shells into Kurdish villages located along the border in northern Iraq.
Baghdad urged Turkey to replace attacks with dialogue.
The Turkish attack came apparently in retaliation for the killing of three soldiers by rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) on Wednesday.

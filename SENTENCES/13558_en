SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The first two cases of bird flu in BiH were confirmed on Friday (17 February). 
According to the head of the state veterinary institute, Jozo Bagaric, two dead swans found in Jajce earlier this month have tested positive for the virus. 
He did not specify whether the birds were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.
Bosnian veterinary authorities have also announced a provisional ban of imports of all livestock or beef from neighbouring Croatia, following a suspected case of mad cow disease there. 
A sample of the affected animal is being sent to Britain for further testing.
On Friday meanwhile, the WHO warned that bird flu could spread among humans in Romania. 
Officials cited the lack of proper water and sewage facilities in rural areas, which they said could facilitate an outbreak.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece is being paralysed by a 24-hour national strike Thursday (April 2nd) organised by the two largest trade unions in the country -- the General Confederation of Workers of Greece and the Civil Servants Supreme Administrative Council. 
Protestors insist that they should not be forced to pay for the financial and economic crisis. 
Employees from the public administration, schools, public hospitals, state-owned enterprises, banks, the private sector and journalists are participating in the strike. 
Public transportation is affected, as is air travel. 
Greece's two main carriers -- Olympic Airlines and Aegean Airlines -- are cancelling about 200 flights, both international and domestic. 
Ferries to the Greek islands are also affected.

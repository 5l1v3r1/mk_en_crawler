ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court unanimously ruled late on Thursday (January 21st) to overturn a law that allows civilian courts to prosecute members of the military.
The decision is expected to result in the handover to military courts of several cases.
Of special interest is the case of army officers charged with trying to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Ergenekon case.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Mobile and landline telephone service for Serbs living in central Kosovo has not been restored yet, Rada Trajkovic, director of the Gracanica Health Centre, said in a letter to Serbian Telecommunications Minister Jasna Matic on Saturday (May 1st).
The letter, explaining that health care providers in the region cannot contact patients, was prompted by Matic's announcement Friday that phone service for people using Serbian operators Telekom and Telenor had been restored throughout most of Kosovo.
Authorities there began dismantling Serbian mobile communications networks over a week ago, arguing they are operating illegally.
The move has left about 100,000 Serbs without a dial tone.

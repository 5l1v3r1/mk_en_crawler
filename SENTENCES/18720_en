SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of major political parties in BiH again failed to reach a compromise on police reforms after the latest round of negotiations Tuesday (March 6th). 
According to Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, parties from the Federation BiH (FBiH) do not want to accept that RS police should represent one unit of the new police structure. 
German Ambassador to BiH Michael Schmunk, who hosted the talks, said the international community hopes an agreement would be struck shortly.
In other news Tuesday, FBiH House of Representatives Speaker Safet Softic said the entity's new government would be formed by March 20th. 
He said that most likely choice for prime minister is Minister of Transport and Communications Nedzad Brankovic.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia-Montenegro's Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU will begin on 7 November and last 12 months. 
That was the word Monday (24 October) from Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus after he and Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic met with European Commission Director for the Western Balkans Reinhardt Priebe in Brussels. 
The negotiations will begin at three levels -- for the federal union and for each of the two republics under the "dual track" approach.
Also announced Monday were plans for Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to visit Croatia in late November. 
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic is to visit Zagreb in mid-December. 
The trips are being described as indicators of bilateral co-operation.

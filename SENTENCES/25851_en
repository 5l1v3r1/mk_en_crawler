BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Friday (October 16th) that Serbia will not interfere in EU and US-led talks in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) aimed at ending the political stalemate there.
The first round of discussions was held at EUFOR headquarters at Camp Butmir on October 9th, attracting leaders of seven main Serb, Croat and Muslim parties.
The goal is to get reforms passed that will put BiH on the path to EU and NATO accession.
Speaking at a meeting of representatives of Republika Srpska's (RS) main political parties in Belgrade, Tadic expressed hope that a compromise will be reached.
"Serbia is my political responsibility, and you are my moral responsibility," Tadic said, stressing that he would support any solution in the negotiations process.

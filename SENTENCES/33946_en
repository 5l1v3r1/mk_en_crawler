ZAGREB, Croatia -- Dutch Defence Minister Henk Kamp reiterated on Thursday (6 November) that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains the key condition for Croatia's success in accession to both the EU and NATO. 
His comment followed a meeting with his Croatian counterpart Zeljka Antunovic in Zagreb. 
The Netherlands and Britain have refused to ratify Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, citing a lack of co-operation. 
Despite that, Kamp and Antunovic agreed on various forms of Dutch assistance to help modernise Croatia's defence sector.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission (EC) has submitted a draft common negotiating position to the Council of the EU, indicating readiness to start accession talks on the judiciary chapter, local media reported on Tuesday (May 25th).
Croatia submitted its negotiating position in February and now expects to launch accession talks on the chapter before the end of July.
UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz is currently visiting Croatia and will present a report on the country's level of co-operation with the tribunal in June.
It must be favourable for The Netherlands and the UK to agree to open the chapter.
Croatian authorities say they have provided all documents requested by the tribunal.

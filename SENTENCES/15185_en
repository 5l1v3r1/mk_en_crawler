BELGRADE, Serbia -- Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, leader of the junior government partner G17 Plus, has confirmed in a press interview that all G17 Plus representatives in the coalition cabinet will resign on Friday (29 September). 
Back in May, G17 Plus decided that if the Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with the EU -- frozen over Serbia's lack of co-operation with the UN tribunal -- did not resume by October, it would leave the cabinet. 
In the interview in Thursday's Novi Sad daily Dnevnik, Dinkic added that all G17 Plus members would leave parliament on Sunday. 
He stressed, however, that he does not anticipate any destabilisation as a result.

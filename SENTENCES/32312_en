BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro are close to an agreement on the constitution of their new joint state, according to a report Saturday (2 November) in the daily  Glas javnosti. 
The newspaper says the only unsolved issue is election regulations for the new federal parliament. 
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic insists that each republic should prepare its own procedures, while his Yugoslav counterpart Vojislav Kostunica insists on a popular vote. 
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic is backing Djukanovic's position, which is expected to accelerate negotiations. 
The constitutional commission meets again Sunday.
In other news, the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia and Kostunica met Saturday to discuss the return of Kostunica's party to the Serbian Parliament. 
The Democratic Party of Serbia lost its 45 seats in the legislature in June, after leaving the ruling coalition.

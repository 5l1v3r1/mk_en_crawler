SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The National Security Council, headed by President Branko Crvenkovski, met on Monday (17 January) to discuss reforms related to NATO integration.
In a statement released afterwards, council members concluded that reforms in the defence and security sectors are on schedule and that the restructuring has caused no gaps in the functions of institutions.
In other news Monday, Croatian Ambassador to Macedonia Aleksandar Milosevic said in an interview that his country would extradite former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski to the UN war crimes tribunal if the tribunal requests it.
Boskovski may be indicted in connection with a deadly police operation against ethnic Albanians in 2001.
He was arrested over the summer in Croatia on a warrant stemming from the 2002 murders in Macedonia of seven immigrants from Pakistan and India.

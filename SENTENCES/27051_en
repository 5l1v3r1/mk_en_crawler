LONDON, United Kingdom -- Britain announced on Tuesday (November 3rd) that it is maintaining its labour market restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians through 2011, to protect the local workforce in a time of recession. 
Over the next two years, the country will allow no more than 25,000 non-professional Romanians and Bulgarians. 
They will be working based on a quota principle in agriculture, and the food and drinks industry, Minister of State for Borders and Immigration Philip Woolas announced. 
London imposed restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers when the two countries joined the EU in 2007, and renewed these restrictions in December 2008.

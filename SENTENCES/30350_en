BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria and Romania have met all technical criteria to join Schengen and are doing even better than some members of the border-free zone in some aspects, Portuguese European Parliament (EP) member Carlos Coelho, the author of a report on the two countries' readiness, said on Tuesday (April 12th). 
The document is to be submitted to the EP's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on May 2nd and will be voted on during a session that opens June 6th. 
The EP offers an opinion but the decision is in the hands of the Council of the EU.

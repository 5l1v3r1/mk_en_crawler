SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops reportedly raided a factory manufacturing tank engines in Republika Srpska on Friday (11 April), part of a six-month long crackdown on illegal arms sales.
The AFP reported that the soldiers arrived in 10 vehicles at the Famos Company in Pale, the former stronghold of the wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
The investigation into the shipment of military hardware to Iraq started when SFOR uncovered evidence of illegal exports of aircraft spare parts.
In other news, a UN prosecutor in The Hague demanded a life sentence for Milomir Stakic, a Bosnian Serb official accused of running prison camps and ordering the murder and deportation of thousands of Muslims and Croats in Prijedor during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Prosecutor Nicholas Koumjian said the campaign amounted to genocide.

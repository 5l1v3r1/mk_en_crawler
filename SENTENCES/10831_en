BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen visited Belgrade on Wednesday (3 November) for talks with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica about the decentralisation process in Kosovo.
According to a statement from the Serbian government, they agreed on continuing the dialogue between Belgrade and the UN administration in Pristina, and on expansion of the task force for decentralisation.
In addition, the talks focused on the need to strengthen security and implement standards -- a key precondition for opening negotiations on Kosovo's final status.
Jessen-Petersen and Kostunica also discussed the protection of Serbian monasteries, monuments and cultural artefacts in Kosovo.

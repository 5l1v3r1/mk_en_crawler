NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The centre-left Republican Turkish Party of Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat won Sunday's (20 February) elections in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and immediately called for a resumption of efforts to bring the two parts of the divided island together. 
Final results showed Talat's party won 44.4 per cent of the votes and 25 seats in the next parliament. 
The party is expected to receive support from the pro-unification Peace and Democracy Party, thus obtaining a one-seat parliamentary majority.

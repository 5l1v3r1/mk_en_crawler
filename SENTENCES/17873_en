SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A group of 50 Muslims from Srebrenica set up a tent city in the centre of Sarajevo on Monday (April 16th) to demand that Srebrenica be given special status outside the jurisdiction of Republika Srpska (RS). 
The Muslims say they suffer discrimination in Srebrenica and that Muslim returnees live in poverty. 
They are threatening to stage a mass exodus from the town. 
Both RS and the international community oppose any such secession and have vowed financial assistance.
In other news, doctors and other medical workers in BiH's other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, went on strike Monday, demanding better pay and the adoption of several administrative measures. 
The 22,000 strikers said they would handle only emergency cases until an action plan is adopted to reform the health sector.

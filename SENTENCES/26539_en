WASHINGTON, United States -- Turkey's Ambassador to Washington, Nabi Sensoy, has resigned, the foreign ministry announced on Wednesday (December 9th).
No official statement has been made explaining the move by one of Turkey's most experienced diplomats.
Media reports suggest it stemmed from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Washington earlier this week and a possible conflict between the two men.
Sensoy, who has served nearly four years in the post, was to step down in two months due to his age.

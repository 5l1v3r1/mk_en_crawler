ANKARA, Turkey -- Iran has reduced natural gas exports to Turkey "to a minimum", Iranian news agency Fars reported on Tuesday (January 1st). 
Due to a sharp drop in temperatures over the past couple of days and the sharp drop in natural gas supplies from Turkmenistan, exports of gas through Turkey have been slashed, the agency reported. 
Normally, Iran exports 20 million cubic metres of natural gas through Turkey. 
Currently the level is a quarter of that. 
Turkmenistan stopped its exports of natural gas to Iran due to technical difficulties, which caused serious shortages in some areas. 
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari says the gas problems had nothing to do with talks under way between Iran and Turkmenistan on a possible price hike.

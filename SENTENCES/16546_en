MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A new Croatian party was officially launched in Mostar on Saturday (8 April), composed largely of former members of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) BiH who left after the election of Dragan Covic as party leader. 
Bozo Ljubic, one of Covic's main rivals within HDZ BiH, leads the new formation, called HDZ 1990. 
Addressing the founding assembly of the new party, Ljubic reiterated his accusations against Covic concerning alleged falsification of HDZ BiH election returns. 
The next general elections will be held in October.

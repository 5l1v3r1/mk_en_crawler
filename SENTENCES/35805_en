WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday (29 January) that a solution to reunifying Cyprus is close.
He urged all parties to work harder in the coming months.
"I think it is time for all of us to put pressure on all sides to get a resolution to this difficult situation," he said after a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
Powell promised to become personally involved in the effort and use Washington's influence with the various players in the region.
Turkey announced last week that it supports the UN plan for the island.
Powell also worked to allay Turkey's fears concerning a break-up of Iraq.
He reiterated Washington's position that Iraq's territorial integrity should be preserved.

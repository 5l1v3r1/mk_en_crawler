TIRANA, Albania -- The left-wing opposition plans to boycott the first round of presidential elections, scheduled to take place in Parliament next week.
Edi Rama, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, made the announcement on Monday (June 11th), after a meeting of the chairmen of the five left-wing opposition groups in parliament.
Rama says the parties believe the Democratic Party (DP)-led ruling coalition wants to impose DP caucus chief Bamir Topi on them, rather than selecting a consensus candidate.

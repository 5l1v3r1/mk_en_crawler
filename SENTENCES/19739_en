WASHINGTON, United States -- The sponsors of a bill in congress, which describes the World War I-era killings of Armenians in Turkey as "genocide", agreed on Thursday (October 25th) to put off debate on the measure in the US House of Representatives.
The White House has warned for weeks that adopting the measure could undermine bilateral relations with Turkey, a key US partner in Iraq.
Four of the sponsors of the bill sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asking her not to schedule a debate on the issue, but indicated they would pursue the measure again next year.
In other news, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Bucharest on Thursday, where he reiterated his country's right to defend itself against attacks by guerrillas with the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
He acknowledged that Washington opposes any incursion into Iraqi territory, but said the final decision is Turkey's alone.
Top US officials have asked Ankara not to launch a major operation against the PKK in Iraq, fearing it would further destabilise the country.(Zaman - 26/10/07;

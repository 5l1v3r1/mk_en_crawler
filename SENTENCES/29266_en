ATHENS, Greece -- Public employees kicked off a 48-hour strike Tuesday (May 4th) against the government's austerity measures that include wage cuts. 
The strike was supposed to last 24 hours and start Wednesday, but organisers decided to launch it earlier. 
Protests are expected to spread throughout the country affecting both the public and private sectors, including railways, air traffic, schools, hospitals in Athens and Piraeus, media and banking. 
Two rallies are planned in Athens on Tuesday.
Late Monday, a small group of teachers forced their way into state television NET in Athens, disrupting programming while Education Minister Anna Diamantopoulou was being interviewed. 
The teachers agreed to leave the building after their demands were broadcast live. 
Separately, armed forces personnel held a silent protest, wearing civilian clothing in Athens on Monday to protest a 30% cut in their salaries.

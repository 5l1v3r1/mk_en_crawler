SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court appeals chamber for organised and economic crime on Tuesday (18 July) abolished the ten-year jail term given to the former Croat member of the BiH presidency, Ante Jelavic, and ordered a re-trial in the case of Hercegovacka Banka. 
Jelavic was convicted of abuse of office and misuse of public funds in relation to the case. 
The appeals magistrates cited errors in the first procedure.
Meanwhile, Jelavic's lawyer Dragan Barbaric said that his client -- who fled to Croatia prior to the implementation of the court's jail sentence -- does not intend to return to BiH.

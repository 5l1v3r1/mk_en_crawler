ZAGREB, Croatia -- The economy, labour and entrepreneurship ministry said Wednesday (14 April) the government would insist on full implementation of the free trade agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The statement was in reaction to comments by BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, who said the government would reduce import tariffs for some foods coming from EU countries as a measure against what he described as "Croatia's monopoly" of the BiH market.

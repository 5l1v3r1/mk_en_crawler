WASHINGTON, United States -- The US government on Friday (1 November) welcomed the election of a new government in Skopje and assured it of continued support. 
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker urged the new cabinet of Branko Crvenkovski to advance "reforms that strengthen Macedonia's multiethnic democratic institutions and market economy."
Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met Friday with Macedonian Ambassador Nikola Dimitrov, Albanian Ambassador Fatos Tarifa, and Croatian Ambassador Ivan Grdesic to assure them of the continuing support of the United States for their countries' bids to join NATO. 
While praising the readiness of the three states to work together and support each other's candidacies, he assured them that each country will be judged on its own merits.
In other news, two separate organisations are now claiming responsibility for Thursday's pre-dawn blast outside parliament. 
The Albanian National Army says it refuses to recognise the parliamentary elections that brought Prime Minister Crvenkovski into office, while the Macedonian National Front vowed to assassinate leaders including Crvenkovski and Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski.
Also in Macedonia, an internationally monitored census is underway. 
It is expected to provide an unprecedented picture of the country's ethnic composition. 
Results are expected early next year.

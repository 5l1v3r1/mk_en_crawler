PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Responding to allegations in Kosovo media, the EU denied on Tuesday (February 15th) that Kosovo's status and territorial integrity will be discussed during negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia. 
"Discussions have a European agenda and not prejudgment on the status of Kosovo," said Maja Kocijancic, spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. 
"The position of the EU regarding these discussions has not changed at all." (Zeri, Kosova Sot - 16/02/11; RTK, TV 21 - 15/02/11)

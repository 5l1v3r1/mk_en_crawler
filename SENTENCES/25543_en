ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Saturday (December 19th) that the EU should allow Turkish citizens to travel to bloc countries without visas.
The demand coincided with the EU lifting visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro.
"It is unacceptable that some countries from the Balkans, which are in an initial stage of their accession process and have not started negotiations yet, received the Schengen privilege, while Turkey, considering its level of relations with the EU, did not receive it," Davutoglu said.
On December 8th, the Union agreed to start talks with Turkey on one more chapter of its acquis.
That chapter, on the environment, opens on Monday, bringing the total to 12 of 35 chapters.
EU leaders froze eight others in December 2006 over Turkey's failure to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes.

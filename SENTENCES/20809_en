TIRANA, Albania -- The future governing programme of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) will be unveiled in June or July, party officials said on Sunday (January 6th).
The SP hopes the programme, designed with the help of European experts, would lay the groundwork for the party's return to power in 2009.
At the end of the month, a group of experts from Germany is arriving in Albania to help craft the programme.
In other news Sunday, more than 2,000 people attended a protest in the southern town of Vlora against the construction of a new coastal terminal to handle oil products in the town's bay.
Opponents are demanding that a local referendum be held on building the terminal.

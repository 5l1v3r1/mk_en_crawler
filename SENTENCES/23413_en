SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Zeljko Komsic, the Croat member of BiH's three-member presidency, said on Friday (May 22nd) that he has asked the state prosecutor to file war crimes charges against former Yugoslav presidents Dobrica Cosic and Zoran Lilic.
Komsic said Cosic and Lilic, who served as Yugoslav presidents from 1992 to 1993 and from 1993 to 1997 respectively, were aware of all actions ordered by the Yugoslav armed forces during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
Komsic said he was responding to Serbia's move to file charges and issue arrest warrants for 19 former Bosnian officials.
They are accused of being responsible for a 1992 attack on a Yugoslav army convoy in Sarajevo that reportedly killed 40 Serb soldiers.

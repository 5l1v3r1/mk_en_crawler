PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- French media are reporting that the new head of UNMIK, Soren Jessen-Petersen, may still accept applications for participation in Kosovoâ€™s October parliamentary elections even though the 4 August deadline has passed.
Jessen-Petersen takes office Monday (16 August).
Acting UNMIK head Charles Brayshaw appeared to confirm the reports, saying it is still possible for Serb parties to register.
He added that UNMIK wants Kosovo Serbs to take part and described the Serbian government's appeal for a boycott as anti-democratic.
As of now, the Civic Initiative of Serbia is the only ethnic Serb party registered to run.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Minister for Refugees and Human Rights Mirsad Kebo hosted a meeting with representatives of the Serbia-Montenegro Commission for Refugees and Displaced Persons in Sarajevo on Tuesday (29 July). 
Kebo said that an estimated 120,000 BiH refugees were living in Serbia-Montenegro without clarification of their status. 
Each person willing to return should have the option to do so, he said, calling for co-operation in the process. 
Bilateral agreements on the issue are expected soon.

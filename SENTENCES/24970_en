PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A small group of Kosovo Serbs continued protests in the northern part of Mitrovica on Thursday (April 30th), but dispersed before noon after being pushed back by police and EULEX forces.
The authorities used tear gas in order to stop demonstrators from reaching the site of reconstructed homes belonging to ethnic Albanians, whose return to the area has been hotly protested by local Serbs.
The same day, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci met with Kosovo mayors and pledged that the right of return -- regardless of ethnicity -- will not be impeded.

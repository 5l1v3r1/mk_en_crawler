THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors in the war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic wrapped up their opening statement Monday (November 2nd), focusing on the July 1995 Srebrenica genocide.
Prosecutor Alan Tieger said that Karadzic ordered Bosnian Serb forces to attack the enclave, killing over 7,000 Muslim civilians.
"He knew that men were being killed, he covered up the mass expulsions and the murders, and continues to do so to this day, and the only regret he had about the entire operation was that some Muslim men got away," Tieger stressed.
He also blamed Karadzic for the 44-month "campaign of terror" against civilians during the siege of Sarajevo.
Karadzic, who boycotted the start of the trial, will appear at Tuesday's procedural hearings to ask for more time to prepare his defence.
He faces 11 charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Bosnian conflict.

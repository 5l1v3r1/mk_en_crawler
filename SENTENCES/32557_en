SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski sent a letter to the defence ministry Thursday (6 March), accusing officials of failing to inform him of the latest military decisions, which by law are within the president's authority.
As an example, Trajkovski said the ministry failed to consult with him prior to announcing plans to donate ten T-55 tanks to Afghanistan and to retire 700 army officers.
The ministry said it is puzzled by the letter and refuted all allegations, noting that Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski meets with the president every week to discuss military issues.

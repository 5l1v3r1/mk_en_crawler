SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Diaspora Minister Bozhidar Dimitrov announced on Saturday (December 18th) he would table his resignation Monday as the government moves to recall all diplomats found to have collaborated to the communist-era secret services. 
Dimitrov's past links to the services were revealed in June 2009.
The so-called Dossier Commission said Tuesday that a total of 218 individuals were affiliated with the secret police. 
That amounts to 47% of the 462 who served as Bulgarian ambassadors, deputy mission chiefs and consuls during the past 21 years.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government revised its package of proposed constitutional amendments before sending it to parliament Tuesday (March 30th). 
Among the 29 amendments aimed at boosting democratic standards and rights, are measures requiring prosecuting senior military staff at the Supreme Court, while regular military personnel would be subject to civilian court trials. 
Banning political parties would be more difficult, as the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) itself has been the target of such attempts. 
Parliament is expected to debate the package next month, though passage is unlikely there. 
The AKP expects to hold a public referendum on the amendments instead.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Parliamentary delegations from the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) issued a list of 26 measures Thursday (10 July) to encourage reforms. 
The delegations approved the document at the end of a two-day meeting in Brussels that reportedly tackled political, economic and social issues, as well as co-operation with the international judicial institutions.
Also Thursday, BiH Federation Defence Minister Miroslav Nikolic warned that the army is experiencing serious budget constraints. 
A large number of federal military units remain without power and water supplies due to unpaid bills, and are having problems with food supplies, Nikolic said. 
The Republika Srpska Army is also reportedly struggling.

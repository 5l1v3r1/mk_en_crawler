BERLIN, Germany -- The defence ministry reported on Wednesday (26 May) that it has found no evidence of German soldiers engaging in abuse of detainees in Kosovo. 
The statement came after a major daily newspaper published a report claiming that photographs showing Germans mistreating detainees were circulating among the troops in Kosovo.
In other news, Kosovo's major newspapers urged the UN on Wednesday to appoint someone with experience in the Balkans to the post of UNMIK chief. 
Harri Holkeri resigned from the post earlier this week, citing health problems.

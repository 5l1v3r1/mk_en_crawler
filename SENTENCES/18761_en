BELGRADE, Serbia -- The United States released $6m in financial assistance to Serbia, following steps by the new government towards co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Belgrade media reported on Wednesday (July 4th) that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has released the last $6m portion of a total $70m in aid that was frozen in May 2006 due to inadequate war crimes co-operation.
A State Department spokesman said, however, the decision does not suggest that Serbia has met all outstanding obligations towards the tribunal.

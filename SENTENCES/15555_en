BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Members of the BiH State Investigation and Protection Agency arrested a Croatian-born Serb who is accused of crimes against humanity.
Jadranko Palic, 37, was detained Thursday (October 26th) in Brcko, where he has been living since 1996 with BiH citizenship.
According to local media reports, Palic was apprehended at the request of BiH prosecutors, who acted on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia.
He reportedly is charged with war crimes committed in Pakrac, Croatia, in 1991, when he was a member of Republika Srpska's Krajina military police.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said Saturday (August 25th) that all assets and bank accounts of wartime leader Radovan Karadzic's family should be frozen as soon as possible.
According to local media reports, Gregorian visited Karadzic's house in Pale on Friday and took pictures and notes of the value of the objects there.
"I came to see all the property belonging to the Karadzic's family.
We have been debating for years now about adopting a law on the freeze of assets, and I believe it is high time we took some concrete steps to make it happen," Gregorian was quoted as saying.
"The Karadzic family assets should be frozen in their entirety, since the family members are part of a network of helpers assisting his hiding," he added.
Karadzic has been on the run since 1995, when The Hague war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

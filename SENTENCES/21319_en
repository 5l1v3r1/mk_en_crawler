BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian politicians should unite their efforts in the fight against corruption and organised crime to respond to criticism by their European partners, EU Consumer Protection Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday (August 26th).
According to Kuneva, it is vitally important to demonstrate that Bulgaria is undertaking resolute steps.
However, Kuneva said it is somewhat unfair on the part of the Europeans to present Bulgaria as a country rife with corruption.
The European Commission's report last month on Bulgaria's progress contained its harshest criticism ever addressed to a member state.

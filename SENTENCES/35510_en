BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The overall assessment of Greece's handling of EU funds is positive, EU Commissioner Michel Barnier said Monday (9 February).
He added that Greek authorities have made progress in implementing the Third Community Support Framework.
Barnier also noted that Greece has been removed from the "v-2" ruling, which covers the longest permissible delay in absorption of funds.
The removal was the result of the country's good track record of correct and timely absorption of EU funds.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Human and Minority Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who is also chairman of the national council for war crimes co-operation, says Serbia-Montenegro is a hostage of one man, indictee Ratko Mladic. 
In an interview Thursday (29 December) with the BBC, Ljajic said the country would enjoy a stronger negotiating position in all matters, including talks on Kosovo's future status, if Mladic were in custody. 
Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic echoed that sentiment, saying Serbia-Montenegro cannot join Euro-Atlantic structures without meeting its war crimes obligations.
Also Thursday, Josep Lloveras, head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Serbia-Montenegro, held a joint press conference with David Gowen, British ambassador to Serbia and Montenegro. 
They urged the country to show full co-operation on war crimes, strengthen administrative capacity, develop its legislative framework and respect and implement the constitutional charter.

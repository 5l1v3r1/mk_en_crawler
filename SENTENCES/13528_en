SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski has received a letter from Greek counterpart Costas Karamanlis, reiterating the desire to find a mutually acceptable solution to the bilateral name dispute.
UN-mediated negotiations between Macedonia and Greece, which does not recognise its neighbour's constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia" for historical reasons, have been fruitless thus far.
Also Monday, the kickoff session of Macedonia's new multiparty commission to revise lists of eligible voters had to be cancelled because Zoran Trajcevski, a representative of the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, failed to attend.
The party wants international observers involved as well.
No one from the ethnic Albanian Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) appeared either.
DPA has refused to participate in national institutions for months, to protest alleged voter fraud in the last municipal elections.

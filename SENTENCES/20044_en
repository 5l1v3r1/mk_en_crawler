SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- War crimes fugitive indictee Stojan Zupljanin will soon be caught, the Republika Srpska (RS) police official responsible for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, Dragi Milosevic, told the Washington Post on Sunday (September 16th).
"We are very close to him and closing in," Milosevic said, adding that authorities had information "he is living like a beast in the countryside or like a peasant in the fields.
He is here, and his connections to Serbia have been cut.
Even his family is against him," Milosevic said.
On May 31st, police in RS arrested former RS army officer Zdravko Tolimir, thought to be one of the main organisers of the network helping top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic elude justice.

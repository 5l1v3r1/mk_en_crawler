BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Justice Ministry is working on a new bill, aimed at facilitating the process of obtaining Romanian citizenship, Rompres quoted President Traian Basescu as saying on Tuesday (August 21st). 
The move mainly targets ethnic Romanians living near the country, giving them the opportunity to benefit from Romania's EU accession It will also allow ethnic Romanians living in neighbouring countries, such as Moldova, to study and work in Romania, in a bid to alleviate personnel shortages in some sectors.

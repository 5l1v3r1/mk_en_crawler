ATHENS, Greece -- Albanian Defence Minister Pandeli Majko and his Greek counterpart, Yannos Papantoniou, signed two military accords in Athens on Monday (25 November).
The agreements secure Greek financial and technical assistance for modernising a military base and a hospital in Albania.
Papantoniou promised further support for reforms Albania is undertaking in hopes of NATO membership.
The meeting was a continuation of talks that began last week in Prague, where the Greek delegation proposed a joint initiative with Turkey in support of Albania and Macedonia's bids.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot government presented an 18-article list on Wednesday (30 April), granting important rights to Turkish Cypriots.
The proposal includes allowing free movement of goods produced in the Turkish Cypriot part of the island, as well as Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU.
The proposal also envisions election of Turkish Cypriots as members of the European Parliament, provided they are citizens of the Republic of Cyprus.

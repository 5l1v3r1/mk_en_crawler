PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Council of Europe (CoE) commissioner for human rights, Thomas Hammerberg, urged Kosovo leaders Thursday (March 26th) to quickly elect an ombudsman, an issue on which various political parties have been unable to agree.
During his visit to Pristina, Hammerberg met with President Fatmir Sejdiu, who complained that Belgrade continues to pressure Kosovo Serbs not to integrate.
In other news, the first trial at the Mitrovica District Court led by EULEX judges wrapped up on Thursday.
Two men accused of a burglary won their acquittal and release.
In a press release, EULEX said the judges found insufficient evidence linking the defendants to the crime.

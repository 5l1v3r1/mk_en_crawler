SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU envoy Miroslav Lajcak kicked off a two-day visit to BiH on Thursday (February 24th) focusing on issues related to the country's EU bid.
Prior to the visit, Lajcak stressed the need for functional institutions in order to meet EU-set criteria and implement reforms.
Though BiH held regular general elections on October 3rd, there is still no government formed in the larger entity, the Federation of BiH.
There is no new state-level cabinet either due to the ongoing conflict among the main Bosniak and Croat parties.

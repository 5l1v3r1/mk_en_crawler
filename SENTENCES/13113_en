SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A government delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska was due to confer with representatives of the European Commission (EC) in Brussels on Tuesday (27 September).
This round of talks likely would be the last before the EC presents its stance on Macedonia's application for EU candidate member status in November.
On Monday, it was announced that the cabinet had adopted the annual programme for NATO membership preparations in 2005-2006.
The document provides for completion of 90 per cent of army restructuring and modernisation tasks by the end of 2006.

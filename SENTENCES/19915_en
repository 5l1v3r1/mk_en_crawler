BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anticorruption Department said on Tuesday (September 18th) that it has sought permission from President Traian Basescu to launch a criminal investigation against Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu for alleged corruption and abuse of power.
The allegations stem from a property deal in which he sold a state-owned plot of land in central Bucharest to a private buyer for 5m euros.
The actual value was estimated at about 100m euros.
Former Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy is also being investigated for the deal.
He was suspended from his post in June.

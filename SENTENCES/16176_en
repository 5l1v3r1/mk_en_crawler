BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn are urging Romania and Bulgaria to overcome failures cited in the latest EC monitoring reports, so that the two countries can fulfil the conditions for timely EU entry in 2007.
The two officials were in Bucharest and Sofia on Wednesday (17 May), a day after the EC put off the membership decision until October.
In Bucharest, Barroso and Rehn urged local authorities to step up efforts to resolve problems in the agriculture and finance sectors.
In Sofia, they called on the government to show real results in the fighting crime and corruption.

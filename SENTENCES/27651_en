BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has asked the interior ministry to withdraw his police protection, a spokesperson said Saturday (September 25th). 
The decision came after a protest by about 6,000 police officers and jail wardens who gathered outside the presidential palace Friday to protest government austerity measures that include a 25% cut in police salaries. 
The protestors blamed the president for the economic crisis and demanded that he meet with labour representatives.
Basescu refused, arguing that holding such a demonstration was illegal. 
That angered the protestors even further, prompting some to throw police caps and plastic water bottles at the presidency building.

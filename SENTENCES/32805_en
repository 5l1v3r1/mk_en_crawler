SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Authorities are investigating a channel for illegal arms trade, announced government spokesman Dimitar Conev on Thursday (5 December).
Conev said that the state is currently looking at some 50 deals, worth around $80m, executed by the arms dealer Terem between 1996 and 2002.
The deals allegedly involve products with both military and civilian applications.
The information comes just weeks after allegations surfaced that Terem had exported products to countries that trade with Iraq.

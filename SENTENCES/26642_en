SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic urged the United Kingdom on Thursday (March 11th) to apologise to former BiH President Ejup Ganic for "mistreating" him while he was in custody.
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade.
He was released on bail Thursday, pending an extradition hearing next month.
Magistrates, who had initially refused to free Ganic, agreed after someone described as a "well-wisher ...
of substantial means" posted a significant bail guarantee.
Serbia wants to prosecute Ganic in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.
Silajdzic complained that while in British custody, Ganic was deprived of some basic rights, including access to a phone, consular assistance, and to his medicine for three days.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London has not commented.

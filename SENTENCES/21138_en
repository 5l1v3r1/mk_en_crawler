SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonian parliamentary members rejected the no-confidence vote against Parliamentary Speaker Ljubisa Georgievski on Friday night (August 31st). 
The vote was filed on August 10th by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which was later joined by the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) and Democratic Union of Integration (DUI). 
The no-confidence motion was sparked by parliament's move to strip former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's immunity last month.

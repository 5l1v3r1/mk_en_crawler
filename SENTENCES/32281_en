SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) first general elections administered solely by BiH authorities will be held Saturday (5 October). 
Well over 7,500 candidates are running for the three-person presidency and parliament. 
Nearly 7,000 foreign and domestic observers will monitor the vote. 
Until now, elections in BiH had been administered by OSCE. 
That changed with the adoption of the BiH election law.
In other news, Republika Srpska says it is poised to press tax evasion charges against senior officials in the Bosnian Serb entity. 
Tax Administration chief Milica Bisic said Thursday that 18 officials, including one minister and eight deputy ministers, have failed to pay personal income taxes worth a total of 3.5m euros.

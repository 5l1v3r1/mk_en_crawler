PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Former President Momir Bulatovic appeared briefly before a court in Podgorica on Monday (September 27th) to testify at the trial of nine people accused of illegal deportation of Bosniak civilians from Montenegro in 1992.
But he did not actually provide testimony because the court rejected his request to be allowed to use state secrets to defend policies in effect during the 1990s.
His testimony was thus postponed.
Nine former police officers were charged with crimes against civilians for handing over 79 Bosniaks to Bosnian Serbs.
Most of the Muslims, who escaped to Montenegro during the 1992-1995 conflict, died at the hands of the Serbs.
Bulatovic has said the deportations were not the result of a state policy.

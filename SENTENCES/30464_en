SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Zlatko Lagumdzija, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), warned on Thursday (February 17th) that his party will move to constitute governing bodies at the Federation of BiH level next month, unless parties that block their formation engage in dialogue and find a solution. 
He said that the SDP would start forming FBiH's parliament, government, elect the entity's president and vice presidents and adopt a budget if no agreement is reached. 
Since the October elections, the process has been blocked by the two parties representing Croats, the HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990, due to failure to reach an agreement on the platform and find a formula for their participation in the government. 
The SDP has offered a coalition agreement to the Party of Democratic Action, the Croatian Party of Rights of BiH and the People's Party Progress through Work.

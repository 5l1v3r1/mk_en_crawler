ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Teachers' Union ended its strike in elementary schools Wednesday (15 January). 
The protests started on Monday with plans to continue until Friday. 
The union cited government pressure in explaining the early conclusion, while the ministry of education called it an unsuccessful attempt with a low participation rate. 
The teachers are seeking higher wages, comparable to those elsewhere in the public sector.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Land Forces' Commander General Ilker Basbug confirmed on Thursday (November 15th) that Turkey has begun preparing for a military strike in northern Iraq.
He added that the army is "implementing a parliamentary authorisation" that allows the military to stage an incursion against terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps there.
Basbug defended the move, saying "in the same way that it would be wrong to think that a cross-border operation would end terrorism, it would be wrong to think that such an operation would not yield results." Turkey has amassed as many as 100,000 troops on the border following a series of attacks by PKK guerrillas.
Quoted on Thursday in the Financial Times, former supreme commander of NATO General Wesley Clark said a strike is not the answer.
Clark said he hoped a diplomatic solution among the US, Turkey, Iraq and the Kurdish regional government would avert a new conflict.

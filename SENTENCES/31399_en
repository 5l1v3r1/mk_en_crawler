BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino Picula met EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten and EU security chief Javier Solana in Brussels on Tuesday (28 January). 
The meetings focused on Zagreb's plan to file an official application for starting accession talks next month and related reforms. 
Picula noted that his government was well aware that the application would significantly expand the country's set of obligations. 
After the meetings, he said co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague would remain the most important criterion for launching accession talks.

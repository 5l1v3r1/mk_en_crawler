ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Thursday (August 12th) he would step down if his Justice and Development Party fails to win next year's parliamentary elections.
"If my party turns out second in the 2011 elections, although I don't expect such a thing, I will give up my post as its leader," Erdogan told local television channels in the Black Sea town of Rize.
"I will hold responsible mostly myself, if my party finds itself in such position," he added.

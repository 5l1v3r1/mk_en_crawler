ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader are in New York, where the UN General Assembly's session opened on Tuesday (19 September).
They are lobbying for their country to get a seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2008-2009.
Local media in Zagreb suggest Mesic and Sanader's meeting with US President George W. Bush -- during a roundtable on applying democracy and freedom of speech worldwide -- also focused on the seat.

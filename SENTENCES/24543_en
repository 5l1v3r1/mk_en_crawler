ANKARA, Turkey -- Incoming NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark said on Monday (April 6th) he will maintain close co-operation with Turkey during his term of office. 
At a press conference on the sidelines of the second annual forum of the UN-led Alliance of Civilisations in Istanbul, Rasmussen described Turkey as "a close ally and a strategic partner". 
He also said Denmark might shut down the Kurdish-language Roj TV station if evidence shows it has ties to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Turkish authorities often criticise the broadcaster for distributing PKK statements. 
Turkey had earlier opposed Rasmussen's bid to become secretary-general, citing Denmark's unwillingness to suspend Roj TV's broadcasts. 
Rasmussen said Danish police and prosecutors are investigating whether there are any economic ties between Roj TV and the PKK, and whether the station's broadcasts incite terrorism.

TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) is urging the opposition Socialist Party (SP) to quit its boycott of parliamentary work and participate in crafting much needed reforms, local media reported on Wednesday (September 23rd).
The head of the DP parliamentary group, Astrit Patozi, said the majority is ready to meet requests from the opposition within the legal framework.
"We want the opposition ...
to have a normal political debate in the highest state institution," Patozi added.
The SP says it won't return until a thorough investigation is conducted into alleged elections violations in June.
Elsewhere, the Union for Human Rights Party is calling for early elections, in order to bring political stability back to the country.
Party head Vangjel Dule said on Wednesday that the current cabinet lacks broad support, as almost half of parliament disputing its legality.
The Union won one seat in the June elections and joined the SP in a pre-election coalition, but decided not to boycott parliament.

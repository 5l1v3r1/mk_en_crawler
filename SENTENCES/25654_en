THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Pre-trial Judge Ian Bonomy said on Thursday (August 20th) he believes that the case of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is ready for trial. 
Bonomy's recommendation is important for setting a start date. 
The judge, presiding over a pre-trial conference for the last time -- as he is stepping down for personal reasons -- asked the prosecution to trim the number of witnesses and documents it intends to introduce. 
Tribunal spokesperson Christian Chartier said on Thursday that a new pre-trial chamber, which will decide on the actual starting date of the trial, will be established "very soon". 
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

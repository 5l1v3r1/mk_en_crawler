ZAGREB, Croatia -- Josip Friscic, chairman of the Croatian Peasants Party (HSS), a ruling coalition partner, denied rumours on Tuesday (March 25th) that the party has considered leaving the cabinet over the decision to postpone implementation of the protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic.
Friscic told the Zagreb-based daily Vjesnik that the HSS still considers the zone a sovereign right of Croatia and will defend its implementation anywhere.
However, he said that it was clear that Croatia's EU accession talks would have faltered had the government not backed down on the issue.
Friscic dismissed as wishful thinking statements by opposition Social Democratic Party leader Zoran Milanovic, who said the ruling coalition would break up over the ZERP.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Nikolay Vassilev opened the Southeast Europe Economic Forum on Monday (14 October), noting some encouraging economic growth in the region despite the relatively small volume of foreign investments. 
He proposed formation of a common market based on bilateral free trade agreements. 
Bulgaria is to sign such agreements with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia and Moldova in the near future.
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Zarko Korac added that Balkan countries share two common goals: European integration and creation of a common market. 
Republic of Srpska Prime Minister Mladen Ivanic said the countries should concentrate on free trade promotion, infrastructure projects and energy market liberalisation.

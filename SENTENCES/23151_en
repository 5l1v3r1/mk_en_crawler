BUCHAREST, Romania -- Fewer than 50% of voters went to the polls Sunday (June 1st) in the first round of local elections, according to preliminary results.
An estimated 18 million Romanians were eligible to vote for 3,200 mayors, 40,000 members of district councils and 41 chairmen of district councils.
A total of 19 candidates competed for the Bucharest mayoralty alone.
Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) candidate Vasile Blaga and independent Sorin Oprescu will meet in a runoff on June 15th.
Only 30% of Bucharest residents voted in the first round.
In most big cities, except for Constanta and Cluj-Napoca, the first round did not settle mayoral elections, thus necessitating runoffs.
In Constanta, Social Democratic Party member Radu Mazare won another term with 63% of the vote.
In Cluj-Napoca, PDL candidate Emil Boc took re-election with 75% of the vote.
Clashes between supporters of different political parties occurred at some voting stations, requiring police intervention.

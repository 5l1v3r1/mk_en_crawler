WASHINGTON, United States -- The House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday (March 6th) in support of NATO's further enlargement and the timely admission of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia together with former Soviet republics Georgia and Ukraine.
Representative John Tanner, a Tennessee Democrat and sponsor of the bill, said the legislation was meant to encourage these countries by signalling US appreciation for their efforts.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also endorsed NATO's plans for further enlargement.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (October 16th) that Belgrade and the EU could reach a compromise on deployment of the EU's EULEX mission in Kosovo, "a compromise that the UN Security Council would approve as well". 
EULEX's arrival does not mean the end of Serbia's presence in Kosovo, he noted. 
He said Belgrade will accept the EU mission under three conditions: it is deployed in Kosovo with the approval of the UN Security Council, the mission's status is neutral and former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan on Kosovo is not implemented.
Also Thursday, Russian Ambassador to Serbia Aleksander Konuzin said Moscow considers the EULEX presence in Kosovo illegal. 
At a meeting with UNMIK, KFOR and Kosovo Serb representatives in the Kosovo town of Gracanica, Konuzin reiterated that Russia would continue to support Serbia in preventing an "illegal split of the country".
Separately Thursday, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier met with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and said his mission has prepared to hand over its premises to EULEX.
According to media reports Friday, UNMIK has allowed EULEX to examine a large number of files on war crimes committed in Kosovo in 2000. 
Sources say the cases may be reopened in January.

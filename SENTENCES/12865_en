BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) has again urged Turkey to meet its commitment to signing a new customs agreement with the EU that would include Cyprus.
Talking to reporters in Brussels on Tuesday (1 February), EC official Jean-Christophe Filori repeated that talks on Turkey's EU membership could not begin on 3 October, as scheduled, unless Ankara signs the document.

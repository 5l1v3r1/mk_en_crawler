BELGRADE, Serbia -- The next round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina will take place on March 24th and 25th in Brussels, Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said on Thursday (March 17th).
Bogdanovic confirmed Belgrade is ready to compromise regarding concrete steps to improve the daily life of the large Serbian population in northern Kosovo.
He also rejected the possibility of Serbia recognising Kosovo in exchange for Kosovo authorities granting autonomy to the north, as proposed by the International Crisis Group.
Round one of the talks was held last week.

TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) may file a no confidence motion against Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli of the ruling Democratic Party. 
SP official Ben Blushi said on Wednesday (16 November) that the Socialists are fed up with the way Topalli leads parliamentary sessions and with improper remarks made about the opposition. 
To demonstrate their dissatisfaction, SP deputies plan to boycott legislative sessions for the next few days.

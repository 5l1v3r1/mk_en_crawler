TIRANA, Albania -- The government is taking another run at lifting the immunity of lawmakers to allow investigations into possible violations. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Monday (June 7th) that the cabinet supports a law on the issue, unlike the opposition Socialist Party (SP), which has objected to it. 
"I hope that the SP accepts it because it will serve the country well," Berisha said during a meeting with lawmakers from his ruling Democratic Party. 
During discussions last year, the SP rejected the law, insisting it violates parts of the constitution.

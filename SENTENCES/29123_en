THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has asked for another delay of his war crimes trial, claiming the presumption of innocence has not been observed.
The proceedings are set to resume on April 13th, but a motion filed by Karadzic's team claims the defendant has been "buried ...
in an avalanche of incriminating evidence before the trial has even started".
On April 1st, the UN war crimes tribunal's Appeals Chamber turned down the former Bosnian Serb leader's request to delay his trial until June.

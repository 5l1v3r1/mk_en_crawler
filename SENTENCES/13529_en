ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prosecutors handling the case of Mehmet Ali Agca announced on Monday (23 January) that the man who wounded Pope John Paul II in 1981 would not be eligible for release from prison until at least 2010. 
On Friday, Agca was put behind bars after Turkey's Court of Cassation overturned a lower court ruling authorising his early release from an Istanbul prison two weeks ago. 
The former Grey Wolves militant has been convicted of serious crimes in Turkey.

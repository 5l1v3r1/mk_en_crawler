ZAGREB, Croatia -- Virovit Mayor Ivica Kirin is likely to become the new interior minister, local media reported Tuesday (12 July), citing government sources. 
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader is expected to table his nomination before parliament this week. 
Kirin would replace Marijan Mlinaric, who is expected to step down due to health reasons. 
But most media analysts say it has more to do with the failure to locate and arrest war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.

TRIPOLI, Libya -- Five Bulgarian nurses on Monday (February 26th) pleaded not guilty to slandering several Libyan security officers. 
The nurses, who have been sentenced to death for allegedly infecting more than 400 children with HIV, had accused Libyan police of torturing them during long months of imprisonment in 1999. 
Prosecutors seek the maximum six-year sentence for the defendants.

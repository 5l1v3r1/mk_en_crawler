BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The six countries taking over terms in the EU rotating presidency over the next three years have adopted a programme, including an expected decision on Croatia's application for EU accession talks in June.
The group has forwarded the document to the Committee of Permanent Representatives, composed of ambassadors of EU members in Brussels.
Other key dates in the document include completion of accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania by the end of next year, and a final decision on Turkey's application for the start of accession talks.

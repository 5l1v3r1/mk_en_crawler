BUCHAREST, Romania -- Members of the Supreme Judges' Council elected a new board Thursday (January 11th), after the yearlong mandate of the former members expired.
The new president is Anton Pandrea, who was named judge for life in the High Court of Justice and Cassation a few years ago.
The new vice president is Dan Chiujdea, the youngest person ever selected for that post.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, who leads the Democratic Party (DS), and Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic, chairman of the G17 Plus party, reaffirmed on Wednesday (November 26th) the unity of the ruling coalition ahead of a no-confidence vote scheduled for Friday, according to the daily Politika. 
The two leaders met to discuss a recent misappropriations scandal involving Belgrade Airport's CEO Bojan Kristo, which forced his resignation Tuesday. 
Dinkic reportedly said his party would propose going public with salaries, bonuses and other costs in the 30 biggest state firms to prevent Kristo's scandal from turning into a hunt against G17 Plus cadres. 
The opposition Serbian Democratic Party is demanding Dinkic's dismissal, alleging he was well aware of and even profited from embezzlement in various state-owned firms.

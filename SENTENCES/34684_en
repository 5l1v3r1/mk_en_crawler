ATHENS, Greece -- The state-run National Tourism Organisation (GNTO) said on Wednesday (20 August) it would take measures to protect the country's image as a tourist destination, as well as the quality of its tourism services.
The statement came in light of several serious incidents, most involving British tourists in the resort of Faliraki.
A British teenager was killed in a bar fight earlier this month, amid several reports of uncontrolled drunken behaviour by British tourists.
The GNTO has begun investigating several tour operators who offer cut-rate packages to young tourists complete with organised ''bar crawling'' or ''bar hopping'' nights.

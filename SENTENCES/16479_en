PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN special envoy for the Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari said on Saturday (10 June) that technical issues must be resolved before the final status of the province is determined. 
Speaking during a visit to Kosovo, he said that finding solutions to practical problems -- particularly decentralisation -- would help create better living conditions for minorities and lead to establishing a multiethnic society, in which all citizens would exercise the same rights. 
He again called on local Serbs to participate in Kosovo institutions.
On Friday, meanwhile, more than 80 people were arrested and a dozen injured after ethnic Albanian protestors clashed with police in Pristina. 
Ethnic Albanian demonstrators had gathered in front of UNMIK's headquarters to demand the departure of the UN administration.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament decided on Wednesday (10 May) to lift the immunity granted to members of the legislature, in the case of deputy Branimir Glavas, an independent who is suspected of war crimes. 
The move came about a week after local prosecutors requested it, amid charges that the former Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) official committed war crimes against ethnic Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. 
Glavas denies the allegations and says the investigation began only after he left the ruling HDZ.

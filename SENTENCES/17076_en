THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serb Radical leader Voijslav Seselj was removed from courtroom Wednesday (November 1st) after he disrupted his trial at the UN war crimes tribunal.
He is charged with crimes committed against non-Serbs during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
He was taken out of court on Wednesday after explicitly refusing -- despite several warnings from Presiding Judge Alphons Orie -- to introduce himself, or to co-operate with his two assigned defence lawyers.
Seselj described them as "spies" who would not defend him.

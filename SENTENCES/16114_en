SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Members of parliaments and representatives of NGOs from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro (including Kosovo) are meeting in Skopje on Friday (19 May) to discuss reforms in the security sector. 
The focus is on establishing control of the various security services in the Balkans. 
Critics say some of the services' activities are less than transparent and reflect their communist-era roots.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus on Sunday (26 December) called for the extradition to The Hague of four police and army generals, indicted for their roles in the 1998-1998 Kosovo conflict.
He said Serbia's continued failure to arrest war crimes suspects is hampering progress towards EU membership.
Labus urged authorities to enforce the UN tribunal's indictments before 27 January, when the EU is due to send a delegation to Belgrade.
In other news, Montenegrin police seized 200kg of cocaine at the Adriatic port of Bar.
The drugs were found aboard a Venezuelan vessel.
Several suspects have been arrested as part of a joint operation with Italy, Serbia and Croatia.

VIANA DO CASTELO, Portugal -- Meeting on Saturday (September 8th), the EU's foreign ministers vowed to adopt a united stance on the future of Kosovo if the current talks on the Serbian province's final status fail.
"The EU wants to maintain a united position today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow," said the bloc's security and foreign policy chief, Javier Solana.
Portuguese Foreign Minister Luis Amado, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, expressed hope that differences among EU states over the issue would be overcome.
"I cannot conceive ...
that we can, in the end of this process, have a situation where you have a strong position of Russia, a strong position of the United States and the European Union simply doesn't exist...
I don't believe we can have any credibility in our foreign policy if that does happen"
Similar words came from French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.
"We are not yet all in agreement, but unity is essential and we will be there when the time comes with that unity," he said.
Solana also ruled out the possibility of the partitioning of Kosovo, while EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed opposition to the idea of speeding up Serbia's accession to the EU if it eases its stance against Kosovo independence.

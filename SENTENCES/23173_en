THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Wednesday (October 1st) postponed the trial of former Yugoslav Army chief of staff Momcilo Perisic. 
"The trial has been delayed until further notice, pending the naming of judges," tribunal spokesperson Nerma Jelacic said. 
Perisic has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed when he was Yugoslav Army chief of staff between August 1993 and November 1998. 
The charges include murder; persecution on political, racial or religious grounds; extermination; inhumane acts and attacks on civilians. 
Many of the charges relate to the siege of Sarajevo, in which thousands of civilians died, and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

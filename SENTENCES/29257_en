TIRANA, Albania -- The government will continue to defend the results of last year's general elections and will not change its stance, despite an ongoing hunger strike outside the cabinet's building, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Monday (May 3rd).
Lawmakers and supporters of the opposition Socialist Party started their strike four days ago, insisting on electoral transparency and an end to the current government.
Berisha instructed health authorities to provide the medical care strikers may need, but urged the opposition to make its case before the Constitutional Court.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The current government is incompetent and corrupt, Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister and leader of the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, said on Saturday (May 24th). 
"Unfortunately Kosovo is led by the corrupt, who are well known among the people for their wrongdoing in the past," he said. 
He also criticised state leaders for "the intolerable situation where state power does not function across the territory", referring to the northern parts of Kosovo where Serbs refuse to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the government. 
Haradinaj returned to Kosovo politics a month ago after being acquitted of war crimes by The Hague tribunal.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced Thursday (11 December) that retired US General Wesley Clark would appear Monday as a witness in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic.
According to a spokesman for the UN court, recordings and transcripts of the former NATO supreme commander's testimony would be made available to the public and the media on 19 December.
The delay would give US government experts time to review the testimony and request the exclusion of material that may be harmful to US national security.
Clark held numerous rounds of talks with Milosevic during efforts to end the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to avert the Kosovo crisis.

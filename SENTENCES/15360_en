PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU special envoy for the Montenegrin independence referendum, Miroslav Lajcak, arrived in Podgorica on Wednesday (26 April) for talks aimed at calming tensions ahead of the 21 May vote.
Lajcak has voiced concern over the way in which the two political blocs, one favouring and the other rejecting independence, are behaving.
He stressed that the referendum process must accelerate Montenegro's integration into the EU, not slow it.

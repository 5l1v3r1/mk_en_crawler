TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialist Party split into two when former Prime Minister Ilir Meta announced on Monday (6 September) that he and at least 10 lawmakers have joined to form a new party, the Socialist Movement for Integration.
He said their mission would be to ensure Albania's integration in the EU and NATO.
The split leaves the ruling party without a majority in parliament.
Also Monday, parliament adopted a declaration condemning the violence that followed Saturday nightâ€™s world championship qualification match between the national football teams of Albania and Greece.
Albania won the match in Tirana.
In subsequent clashes among fans in Greece, one Albanian was killed and seven people were injured -- six of them Albanian.
The Greek government has also condemned the violence.

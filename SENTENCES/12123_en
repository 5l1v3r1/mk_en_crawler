SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Senior NATO and US envoys to BiH indicated on Tuesday (14 December) that Republika Srpska (RS) would have to bear the consequences of its continued failure to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
General Steven P. 
Schook, the commander of NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, said he was very disappointed that BiH -- and particularly RS -- had failed to fulfil the obligation to co-operate. 
Separately, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas L. 
McElhaney said that RS's lack of co-operation was thwarting BiH's progress and integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. 
Following talks with RS government officials in Banja Luka, McElhaney said that while there have been many promises, there have been no concrete results.

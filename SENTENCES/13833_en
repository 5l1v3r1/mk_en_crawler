TIRANA, Albania -- Re-runs of last month's parliamentary elections are under way Sunday (21 August) in three Albanian constituencies -- Shkodra, Lushnje and Gjirokaster. 
The Central Election Commission (CEC) ordered the repetition of the vote because of irregularities in the 3 July election. 
The outcome of the reruns is not expected to affect the margin of victory of the Democratic Party. 
The CEC says all necessary election material was delivered to the three constituencies Friday under police guard.

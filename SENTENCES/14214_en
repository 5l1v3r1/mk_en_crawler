THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal decided on Monday (12 December) to suspend the trial of Slobodan Milosevic for six weeks to give the defendant some rest in view of his poor health.
The judges turned down his request for a trip to Moscow for medical treatment.
The trial will resume on 23 January.
On Friday, the judges rejected another request by Milosevic, who wanted to summon British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder as defence witnesses.
Milosevic claims the two could prove he was a peacemaker in the Kosovo conflict.

TIRANA, Albania -- The final results of the May 8th local elections remain up in the air, with the Central Election Commission (CEC) and political parties facing an unprecedented scenario over the validity of votes. 
At issue is whether the CEC should accept or ignore ballots cast in the wrong boxes. 
If they are ruled valid, then the results in Tirana's mayoral race swing either way, as incumbent Mayor Edi Rama currently leads by a mere ten votes.
There were heated debates about the matter Monday (May 16th), as such a scenario was not considered during the 2009 reforms of the Electoral Code. 
The opposition Socialist Party, which Rama leads, insists that the CEC validate the election list and announce the winner, while the ruling Democratic Party hopes to overturn the results in favour of its mayoral candidate, Lulzim Basha.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative issued a statement Sunday (18 September) urging authorities in Republika Srpska (RS) to realise that they must end their self-deception and show real engagement in reforms. 
The statement came in response to continued declarations by leading Bosnian Serb politicians that Banja Luka is prepared to continue negotiations on the issue of police reform, the main condition for launching Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks. 
The EU last week indicated that the opportunity for that to happen this year has passed.

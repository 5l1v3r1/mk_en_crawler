THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Bosnian Serb wartime President Radovan Karadzic on Thursday (March 10th) sought a delay of three more weeks to study thousands of pages in materials submitted recently by prosecutors at his war crimes trial. 
The court already agreed in mid-February to suspend the trial until May 5th. 
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from his role in the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
In other news, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj on Wednesday requested 10m euros in compensation from The Hague tribunal and reiterated demands to drop all charges against him, insisting they are groundless. 
Prosecutors say all counts are valid. 
He is accused of war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

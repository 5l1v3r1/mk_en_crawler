BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two opposition parties are calling for maximum efforts to prevent voter fraud during the next local elections, scheduled for 6 June. 
The National Liberal Party warned on Wednesday (7 April) that irregularities may occur, as the foreign election monitors' presence would be only "symbolic". 
Greater Romania is urging other opposition parties to alert the international community to potential problems.
In other news, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro agreed Wednesday to hold a joint drill on the Danube in May. 
It will simulate a counterattack against a terrorist strike.

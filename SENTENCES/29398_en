BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition New Serbia (NS) party on Thursday (July 1st) demanded the resignation of Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic over a corruption scandal at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology. 
On Wednesday, the institute's director, Nenad Borojevic, and six other people were arrested for allegedly taking 1m euros worth of bribes from pharmaceutical companies, in connection with cancer treatment medicines. 
Investigators say patients were prescribed higher than necessary doses of cytostatic drugs in order to boost medicine consumption. 
NS lawmakers said on Thursday that the suspects should be accused of "organised murder", considering the consequences the high doses had on patients.

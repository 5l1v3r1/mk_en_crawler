SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the BiH Consumers Association and the chairwoman of the Confederation of Trade Unions of BiH warned on Friday (November 16th) that unrest could erupt over the soaring prices of basic foods.
Mesud Lakota and Ranka Misic said that political volatility was not helping and that more and more people are going to bed hungry.
The pair called on the entity governments to stabilise prices.
Central Bank Governor Kemal Kozaric and several local analysts seem to agree, citing price hikes by retailers trying to profit from political uncertainly.
Kozaric said that many people have started to stockpile food.
The Dnevni Avaz newspaper reported on Friday about enormous price hikes for all basic foods.
Butter, for instance, costs 65% more now than it did three months ago.
The price of flour, sugar, milk, cheese, bread, poultry, most fruit and vegetables are all increasing at a much faster rate than household income.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government must fight organised crime more seriously, British Ambassador to Bulgaria Jeremy Hill said Tuesday (29 November), in a briefing on the European Commission's latest comprehensive monitoring report for Bulgaria. 
He said it is important to halt such crime so that the country will be prepared fully to join the EU on 1 January 2007, as planned. 
Earlier this week, US Ambassador to Bulgaria John Beyrle delivered a similar message.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A former member of the Serb paramilitary unit the Scorpions, Pero Petrasevic, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges related to the 1995 murders of six young Bosniaks in Srebrenica.
At the Belgrade special court for war crimes, Petrasevic said he participated in the killings under direct orders from senior officers.
The executions were captured on a videotape that surfaced last year.
In other news, Serbian media on Tuesday (21 February) largely ignored government denials that war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic has been tracked down and was expected to surrender.
Local media and international news agencies quoted sources claiming that the fugitive's hideout had been discovered.
But Srdjan Djuric, a spokesman for Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, said media reports of Mladic's arrest are actually damaging government efforts to bring him to justice.
The rumours come ahead of next week's report to the EU foreign ministers by Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who will assess whether Serbia is co-operating with The Hague tribunal.
Serbia-Montenegro's Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU could be halted if the level of co-operation is deemed inadequate.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Sunday (April 11th) that Serbia and Croatia are searching for an out-of-court solution of the two countries' reciprocal genocide lawsuits filed at the International Court of Justice, for war crimes committed during the 1990s. 
Tadic was speaking to journalists in Donja Gradina, BiH, after attending a commemoration of the 65th anniversary of a mass escape attempt from the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp, run by Ustasha forces in World War II. 
The sprawling facility was situated on the banks of the Sava River between Croatia and Republika Srpska (RS). 
Senior officials from RS, BiH, international institutions, religious communities and families of the victims gathered in Donja Gradina for the ceremony.

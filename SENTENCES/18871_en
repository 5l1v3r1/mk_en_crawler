THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The chairman of the Serbian national council for ties with the UN tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, asked the tribunal on Tuesday (December 5th) to allow indictee Vojislav Seselj to receive medical treatment in Belgrade, from doctors he trusts. 
Seselj has been on a hunger strike since November 10th, in part to protest the assigning of lawyers to defend him. 
A team of doctors visited him Tuesday, but he refused treatment.
Also at The Hague, Croatian General Ante Gotovina on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to two new counts of war crimes, as well as two of crimes against humanity. 
Gotovina is accused of taking part in a joint criminal conspiracy to drive Serbs out of the Krajina region of Croatia.

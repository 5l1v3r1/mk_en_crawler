PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic on Monday (September 8th) said that "certain sections of the international community" expect Podgorica to recognise Kosovo. 
"Those expectations are not surprising. 
If we want to be part of the European and Euro-Atlantic community, then our partners from those communities expect us to follow their main foreign policy paths," Djukanovic told journalists. 
Asked whether and when Montenegro will recognise Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence, he replied it is "the authorities' duty to be guided, first and foremost, by state interests". 
The US and UK ambassadors in Podgorica have said their governments expect countries in the region to establish diplomatic ties with Pristina.
In Pristina on Monday, US diplomat and Dayton Accord architect Richard Holbrooke called on Montenegro and Macedonia to recognise Kosovo. 
He urged the EU to reject Serbia's membership bid as long as Belgrade "considers Kosovo its territory". 
Admission should occur "only if there is full agreement in Belgrade to recognise Kosovo as an independent state", Holbrooke told reporters after meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci.
Also Monday, Thaci and President Fatmir Sejdiu discussed recognition by neighbouring Macedonia, saying it must be unconditional. 
They additionally called for acceleration of the border demarcation process with Macedonia.

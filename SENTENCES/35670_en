TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Tuesday (6 April) the European Commission (EC) report on Albania's progress in the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) is realistic. 
The report was highly critical of the pace of implementing reforms, noting that despite some progress achieved, many of the country's SAP commitments have not been met. 
The EC was particularly critical of the growing political instability.
Also Tuesday, the Chief of Staff of the Albanian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Pellumb Qazimi, said the government is considering whether to send more troops to Iraq, as requested by commanders of the international coalition forces.

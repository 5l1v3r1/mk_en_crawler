BUCHAREST, Romania -- British Ambassador to Bucharest Robin Barnett said on Wednesday (12 July) that Britain would lift the visa regime for Romanian citizens, prior to the country's EU accession.
Barnett added that his embassy would introduce an online visa application system in September that is expected to end the long queues that form in front of the embassy.
In Washington, the senate is looking into easing the US visa regime for Romanians.
Barnett also voiced support for a new Romanian anti-corruption initiative, launched Wednesday as a joint project of the Romanian and British governments and several NGOs.
It envisions boosting public awareness through commercials and billboards.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Albanian President Alfred Moisiu said Monday (2 June) that independence is probably the only option for Kosovo. 
In an interview with the Pristina daily <I>Koha Ditore</I>, the Albanian president advocated the idea of calling an independence referendum, claiming it is the right of the Kosovo people to decide the status of the province on their own, taking into account the stance of the international community.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic said that in his view, the time for resolving the status of the province is not opportune. 
Speaking at the summit of Western Balkan leaders in Ohrid, Macedonia, Marovic said moving towards EU integration takes precedence over resolving the fate of the province.

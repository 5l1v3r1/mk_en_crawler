PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The UN plan for Kosovo offers a "unique opportunity" for stability in the Balkans, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said on Thursday (March 22nd). 
France fully supports the plan for the province drafted by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, Douste-Blazy told reporters during a visit to Pristina. 
He characterised the blueprint as "a balanced solution, reconciling the aspirations of Kosovo's majority population with serious guarantees offered to the Serb community and other minorities". 
He reiterated that position during meetings later with Serbian officials.
Meanwhile, Kosovo police confirmed that an explosion hit a popular restaurant in Pristina late Wednesday. 
The hand grenade caused no casualties or serious damage.

The hit show 'Baywatch' may be TV fantasy, but in the real world, lifeguards play a crucial role in ensuring beach safety.
They may soon be manning beaches across Albania, under a new project backed by the OSCE, the German organisation GTZ and local police.
A staff of 24 lifeguards already has been introduced at the popular beach of Velipoja in northern Albania.
Working in collaboration with ten police officers, they are there to keep watch over the beach and provide help to vacationers.
Lifeguards will be at the beach until the end of August, according to Malteser, the organisation that is staffing the "Baywatch 2006" project.
The lifeguards are recruited by the police and work on a volunteer basis.
They will be on duty 24 hours a day in order to deliver first aid in emergency situations.
They comprise four teams, each with transport and communication equipment, first aid kits and binoculars.
Four watchtowers have been constructed, capable of holding two people -- a lifeguard and a policeman.
The 3m-high structures have been equipped with coloured flags that indicate sea conditions.
Green means conditions are normal.
When waves appear and swimming is difficult, an orange flag is hoisted.
When it is impossible to swim safely, it is time for the red flag.
According to Malteser, the goal is to "increase the safety of the public, reduce the number of fatalities, increase the attraction of Velipoja for the tourists, increase the co-operation between the police and the community and develop and strengthen the public's trust in the state police."
Velipoja, located 34km west of Shkodra, is the most visited resort in the north of the country.
Just 15 years ago, this was a simple fishing village with a handful of houses.
Now it is packed with tourists from Albania, Macedonia and Kosovo.
If the pilot programme there is successful, it will be implemented along the entire 362km Albanian coast.

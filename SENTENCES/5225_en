Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis of the ruling New Democracy (ND) party, half way through his second term, is seeking a renewed mandate in early elections on Sunday (October 4th).
If current polls prove accurate, however, the vote could mean victory to his main political rival, George Papandreou of the leftist Panhellenic Socialist Union (PASOK).
The ND already suffered a blow earlier this year, losing to PASOK in the European Parliamentary elections. 
It received 32.68% of the vote, compared to 36.75% for PASOK.
Though the margin was not enough to give the Socialists extra seats in the EP, it was considered clear evidence of the prime minister's declining political fortunes. 
Voters punished the ND for a series of political scandals, as well as the country's economic woes.
Currently, ND has the slimmest of parliamentary majorities -- 151 out of 300 seats -- and has little room to manoeuvre.
"When a party has 151 seats, the reality is that any harsh confrontation with an MP can lead the country into elections," Karamanlis told <i>Real News</i> on Sunday (September 27th).
After two failed attempts, Papandreou may now be poised to take the helm. 
But even if PASOK triumphs on Sunday, it is not clear whether it will be able to achieve the needed margin among MPs. 
Under Greece's electoral system, a party can win the vote and still fall short of a clear parliamentary majority.
Meanwhile, a 3% threshold requirement for parliamentary representation could come into play. 
Smaller parties are struggling to meet that requirement, with polls suggesting the Syriza will make it, but the Ecogreens might not. 
PASOK's chances of forming a government could hinge on their performance.

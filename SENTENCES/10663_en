THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) will set up a three-member trial chamber to decide whether to transfer the trial of two Croatian generals to Croatia, the UN said Wednesday (8 September). 
The two -- Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac -- were indicted for war crimes allegedly committed during a 1993 military operation in an area inhabited by ethnic Serbs.

Romania's Bran Castle officially became the private property of Dominic of Habsburg in May.
For the last three years, the culture ministry managed the building.
Habsburg, a New York architect and nephew of Romania's last king, said he would significantly restore the castle.
Under the motto "Bran Castle is coming back to life", the new administration is turning the castle into a place that offers more than history and culture, marketing manager Alex Priscu told Southeast European Times.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska President Milan Jelic criticised on Wednesday (April 25th) a recently adopted resolution by the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Parliament, which urged the removal of Srebrenica municipality from RS jurisdiction and giving it a special status within BiH.
According to the statement from Jelic's office, the move represents a violation of the Dayton Peace Accords, as well as both the BiH and RS constitutions.
Jelic also called on the Office of the High Representative to respond to Parliament's resolution.
Bosniak parties in BiH have been seeking special status for Srebrenica, following the International Court of Justice's recent ruling that genocide was committed there in July 1995.
Separately Wednesday, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik visited Srebrenica, where he presented his government's plan for economic revival of the area.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Past governments in Turkey have made mistakes in handling relations with the country's Kurd minority, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech in Diyarbakir on Saturday (13 August).
The solution to the so-called Kurdish problem should be found through boosting democracy, Erdogan said, adding that "a big state has the self-confidence to lay out its mistakes and good deeds on the table".
The speech won strong praise from the Kurdish community -- Erdogan is the first Turkish leader to admit to the errors.
Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir said it could mean the turning of a new page in the government's interaction with the Kurds.

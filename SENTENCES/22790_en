ANKARA, Turkey -- Lawmakers on Wednesday (October 8th) approved a proposal extending the army's authority to launch cross-border operations into northern Iraq for another year.
The current mandate expires on October 17th.
A record majority of 511 to 18 supported the resolution.
The extension allows the army to conduct both land and air operations against bases of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.
The Higher Counterterrorism Board (TMYK) is expected to meet Thursday to discuss possible measures against the PKK, including an incursion into northern Iraq.
The TMYK will also discuss a proposal by the opposition Nationalist Movement Party to establish a buffer zone between Turkey and Iraq in hopes of stopping terrorist infiltration.
Shortly before the vote in parliament, unknown assailants attacked a police vehicle in southeastern Diyarbakir, Turkey, killing four police officers and a civilian driver and injuring 20 other people, said Interior Minister Besir Atalay.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Also Wednesday, the army says four PKK members died in clashes with Turkish security forces in the southeastern province of Sirnak.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovo Judicial Council announced on Friday (October 9th) it has dismissed a judge after he revealed he voted against the indictment of three former Albanian rebels suspected of war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo. 
According to the council, Judge Rahman Ratkoceri made a serious violation. 
Ratkoceri defended himself by explaining that he publicly stated his position on the issue after he was threatened because of his involvement in the trial.

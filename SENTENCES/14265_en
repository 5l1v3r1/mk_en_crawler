ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have been the target of an assassination attempt, a prosecutor said Monday (12 September). 
Erdogan was leaving a ceremony at a school in the western town of Kutahya when a shouting protester tried to get on the prime minister's bus. 
Police searched the man and discovered a pistol hidden in one of two loaves of bread he was carrying. 
Investigators are trying to determine if the suspect has links to any terrorist organisations.
In other news Monday, the main opposition Republican People's Party said it would propose that an extraordinary session of parliament be held within a week to discuss recent terrorist incidents in Turkey. 
The ruling Justice and Development Party insists, however, that the security situation is under control.

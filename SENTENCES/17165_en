PARIS, France -- A resolution adopted by the NATO Parliamentary Assembly's spring session in Paris this week acknowledged the progress achieved by the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- and voiced support for their NATO aspirations.
The document, approved on Tuesday (30 May) and widely quoted in the regional press, read that if the three states continue pursuing a course of ambitious reforms, their bid to join NATO "should be seriously considered no later than 2008", with signals to be sent at the November summit in Riga.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The second round of technical talks on a visa facilitation regime and single readmission accord between Serbia and the EU was held Thursday (January 18th) in Belgrade. 
This one focused on visa fees, multiple entry visas and the shortening of visa granting procedures. 
At a subsequent news conference, EU representatives confirmed significant progress was made regarding the final wording of the agreements and suggested the talks may take up two more months to complete.

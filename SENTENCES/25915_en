TIRANA, Albania -- Corruption remains a serious problem in Albania, European Commission (EC) head in Tirana, Helmut Lohan, said on Wednesday (November 18th). 
He added that corruption affects crucial foreign investment. 
Speaking at a conference on doing business in Albania, Lohan welcomed structures and programmes to fight the phenomenon, but warned it is still poses a serious problem in many fields. 
He called on parliament to step up reforms, and urged lawmakers to consult with businesses while drafting bills concerning them.
Separately Wednesday, local media reported on a study by the European Chamber of Commerce that finds most Albanian businesses are dissatisfied with the fiscal administration and consider tax policies unclear, insufficient and often selective. 
The report mentions the same problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, while businesses in Macedonia and Montenegro generally have a positive view of their tax systems.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (January 26th) that a letter from Greek counterpart George Papandreou urging better ties between their countries, is "a positive and promising solution to problems". 
Papandreou's letter came in response to one from Erdogan in October. 
Papandreou invited Erdogan to an official visit, saying he wants to establish "more productive ties" between Ankara and Athens. 
He also urged Turkey to stop disputing Greek sovereignty in the Aegean Sea, particularly by violating Greece's air space.
Separately Tuesday, Papandreou went before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, telling members the time has come to resolve Greece's longstanding name dispute with Macedonia. 
If the issue is resolved satisfactorily, he said, Athens will support Skopje's efforts to join the EU and NATO.

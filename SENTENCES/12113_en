ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has described Croatia's co-operation with The Hague tribunal as incomplete, adding that the country will be given more time to fulfil all requirements for opening EU membership talks. 
In an interview published by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet on Sunday (13 March), Rehn said Zagreb has speeded up the search for fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina, but expressed agreement with chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte's criticism of Zagreb's level of co-operation. 
The final decision on launching accession talks will be made Wednesday.

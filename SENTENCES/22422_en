PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier has sent a draft proposal regarding UNMIK's reconfiguration and reduced competencies to UN headquarters in New York for review by the UN secretariat. 
"We are now waiting for the UN's response to finalise the proposal," UNMIK spokesperson Russell Geekie announced on Monday (July 14th). 
The restructuring would clear the way for the new EU mission in Kosovo, EULEX.
Also Monday, Zannier met with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, who said he appreciates the role the UN has played thus far in Kosovo and said he wants continuing co-operation during the transitional period.
In other news Monday, Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti announced that Kosovo citizens will start receiving new passports next week. 
There will be four types -- diplomatic, ordinary and official passports, as well as travel documents. 
They will replace the UNMIK travel documents used since 1999.

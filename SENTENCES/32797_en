BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Following heated debate, the Yugoslav constitutional commission finally approved the final text of the charter Friday evening (6 December).
The commission agreed to hold direct elections in the new state two years after the charter is ratified by the parliaments, while an independence referendum could take place after three years.
All state institutions are to be established before 31 January of next year.
Expectations are now high that the parliaments of Serbia and Montenegro, as well as the federal legislature, will approve the charter by the end of the month.
Local politicians and the international community applauded the adoption of the charter as a major step towards creating the loose federation.

ATHENS, Greece -- Six police officers were injured on Tuesday (October 27th), two of them seriously, when gunmen opened fire on a police station in the northern Athens suburb of Agia Paraskevi. 
Two men on a motorbike attacked with automatic weapons and managed to escape. 
Many of the injured were hit by flying glass. 
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though similar ones have been carried out by extreme leftist organisations.

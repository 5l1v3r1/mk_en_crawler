SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an open letter to Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, Transparency International (TI) Chairman Huguette Labelle expressed concern Monday (January 14th) with the way Dodik and the RS government reacted to critical reports on two recent privatisation deals.
In particular, the TI cited Dodik's claim that the organisation wants "to damage RS and halt its economic development" and by threats to launch legal proceedings against the TI's branch in BiH.
Such reactions "undermine the freedom of expression", Labelle said.
One deal the NGO cited involved the agreement RS struck with Czech power utility CEZ to modernise and expand the Gacko power plant.
TI says it would have negative consequences for the local capital market, and even more worrisome is the fact the cabinet bypassed both parliament and Gacko shareholders.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Campaigning ahead of Sunday's (March 22nd) presidential and local elections wraps up Friday. 
A total of seven candidates are vying to succeed incumbent Branko Crvenkovski, who decided not to seek another five-year term. 
Polls suggest Gjorgje Ivanov, nominated by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, is the frontrunner, followed by opposition candidate Ljubomir Frckovski. 
None of the seven, however, appears to have enough support to win in the first round, likely forcing a run-off on April 5th.

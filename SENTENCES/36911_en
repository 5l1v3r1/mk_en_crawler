BAGHDAD, Iraq -- During a one-day visit to Baghdad on Sunday (4 July), Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana reaffirmed support for the democratisation and stabilisation of Iraq. 
Geoana, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, met with the new Iraqi sovereign authorities. 
He pledged to inform UN Secretary General Kofi Annan about their request to hold elections in January. 
They also discussed NATO's recent offer to train Iraq's security forces.
In other news, several senior officials within Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party have stepped down from their party positions as a result of weak showings in last month's local elections. 
The party had given them until Saturday to resign.

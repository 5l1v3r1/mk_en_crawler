NEW YORK, United States -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic and Bosniak presidency member Haris Silajdzic met on Tuesday (May 22nd) in New York with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and General Assembly President Sheikh Haya Rashed Al Khalifa.
Ban stressed that national reconciliation among the three ethnic communities is key to progress in BiH.
He also called for crucial police, public administration and national broadcasting reforms.
Radmanovic and Silajdzic reaffirmed the country's commitment to the international alliance against terrorism, as well as to the strengthening of democratic institutions.
Silajdzic will meet with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik in Washington on Wednesday, in a bid to overcome the stalemate on key reforms.
US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried and Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns will attend the meeting.
In other news, BiH High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling extended a public warning Tuesday to several BiH politicians who he says are responsible for the failure to form the new government in the Central Bosnia and Herzegovina-Neretva Cantons.
Schwarz-Schilling said such behaviour is "a shameful waste of time and betrayal of voter's confidence".
Elections were held eight months ago.

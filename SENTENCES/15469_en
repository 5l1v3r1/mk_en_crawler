BELGRADE, Serbia -- A meeting under the Enhanced Permanent Dialogue initiative between the Serbian government and the European Commission was held in Belgrade on Wednesday (26 July). 
It was the first such gathering since the breakup of the federal union between Serbia and Montenegro. 
The focus was on legal and institutional aspects of transferring the former union's responsibilities to Serbia, as well as measures that must be undertaken in the fields of defence, human and minority rights, visas, asylum and migration.
In other news, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel paid an official visit to Belgrade on Wednesday. 
He is proposing that Central and Eastern European leaders hold a regional summit on the Kosovo status issue. 
Any future solution must be agreed upon, rather than imposed, Rupel said.

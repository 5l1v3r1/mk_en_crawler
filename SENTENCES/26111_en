LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Parliament's foreign policy and EU affairs committees green-lighted on Tuesday (September 15th) efforts to lift the blockade on Croatia's EU accession talks.
The committees endorsed the recent agreement between Prime Minister Borut Pahor and Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor to unblock Zagreb's EU integration process after hours of debates and strong criticism from the opposition.
Sweden, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, says it will convene an intergovernmental conference to resume Croatia's accession negotiations on October 2nd.
A separate meeting will focus on the longstanding border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Police on Wednesday (26 October) arrested nine fellow police officers in connection with the 1999 killings of civilians in Kosovo.
The suspects were brought before an investigating magistrate who will decide whether to detain them for 30 days until they are formally charged.
The nine are accused of taking part in the murder of 48 men, women and children in Suva Reka on 26 March 1999.
The bodies of the victims, all members of one family, were found in a mass grave at a police compound near Belgrade in 2001.
Officials say they had been moved there by Serbia's security services.

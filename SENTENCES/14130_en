BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's prosperity depends on its willingness to arrest and extradite to The Hague several war crimes suspects who are still at large, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said during a visit to Belgrade on Friday (14 October).
Closer ties with NATO and the United States would be possible only when the remaining fugitives -- including former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic -- are brought to justice, Burns told Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic.
He also said negotiations on the final status of Kosovo could begin next month, following the six-nation Contact Group's meeting in Washington on 2 November.

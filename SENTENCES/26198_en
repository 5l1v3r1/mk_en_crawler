ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic told Croatian National Radio on Thursday (August 13th) that he opposes the use of Catholic religious symbols in state institutions. 
"Only the coat of arms of the republic, maybe the flag, and nothing else, should be used [in public]. 
Because we are a secular state, I think that we should apply that," said Mesic. 
Local legislation does not ban the use of religious symbols in places predominantly populated by Catholics. 
Mesic warned against the use of religious symbols in military institutions, and added such symbols should be reserved for churches and religious ceremonies.

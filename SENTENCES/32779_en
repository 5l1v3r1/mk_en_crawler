ZAGREB, Croatia -- Defence Minister Zeljka Antunovic conceded Monday (9 December) that the country was not ready to join NATO immediately.
During a lecture at Zagreb's Faculty of Political Sciences, she called for faster reforms aimed at meeting accession criteria for the next enlargement wave, adding that membership would also depend on respect for democratic values, human rights and market oriented reforms.
Also Monday, a new five-station radar system was unveiled that will replace Croatia's current network of 18 radar stations.
Officials say it has both military and civilian applications.

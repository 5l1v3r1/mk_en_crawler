BELGRADE, Serbia -- UNICEF vowed to work closely with Serbian institutions to help reform the archaic childcare system, including agencies dealing with the mentally disabled, according to a statement issued on Friday (November 16th). 
UNICEF said that while there have been joint efforts in the past, progress was limited. 
The organisation also agreed there are serious deficiencies in the treatment of children and adults with disabilities, an issue the US-based human rights group Mental Disability Rights International raised last week.

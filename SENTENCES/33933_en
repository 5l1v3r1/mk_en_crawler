BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Belgium completed the ratification process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Croatia and the EU Friday (7 November). 
The procedure was considered the most difficult among all EU members, due to the large number of institutions involved in the ratification. 
Croatia expects the EU to complete the process early next year, giving the country official EU candidate status. 
The country hopes to be ready for full membership in the Union in 2007.

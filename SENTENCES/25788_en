ANKARA, Turkey -- A group of 34 members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) arrived in Turkey from northern Iraq on Monday (October 19th) and surrendered to local authorities in a gesture of reconciliation, following a call from their jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
The self-described "peace group" consisted of 26 people from the Makhmur refugee camp, and eight from the Qandil Mountain, where the PKK's main camps are based.
A total of 400 people have expressed an interest in participating in such groups, which were formed after the government in Ankara undertook an initiative to give more rights to Turkey's Kurdish minority.
Monday's group, which included nine women and four children, were questioned by investigators, who reportedly decided to detain five people and release the rest.
Thousands of people, including lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party and leader Ahmet Turk, turned out to welcome the group.

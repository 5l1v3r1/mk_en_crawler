TIRANA, Albania -- Health Minister Anila Godo on Monday (September 8th) warned that doctors who leave underdeveloped regions of Albania will lose their licences. 
At a meeting with regional health directors, Godo asked for precise information about doctors' whereabouts in order to better distribute them across the entire country. 
Mountainous areas usually suffer from an absence of doctors, since many search for better working conditions elsewhere.

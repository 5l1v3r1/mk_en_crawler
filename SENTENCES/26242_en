ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic announced on Friday (November 13th) that Croatia has sent a report to The Hague war crimes tribunal, describing measures undertaken to provide documents requested by prosecutors.
He added that he expects a prompt response from chief prosecutor Serge Brammerz, who is to deliver his report on Croatia's co-operation with the tribunal to the UN Security Council next month.
According to Simonovic, a total of 60 people working in various institutions helped draft the document, sent on Friday.
He added that the report contains information on some documents that have been found, but not on the so-called "artillery diaries" related to 1995's Operation Storm, conducted in Knin.

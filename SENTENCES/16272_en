BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers urged BiH authorities on Monday (15 May) to ensure the adoption of constitutional amendments, as well as the implementation of police reforms, as main conditions for progress in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the Union.
The statement, issued after the EU Council's meeting in Brussels, stressed that the constitutional amendments are aimed at turning BiH into a fully functional state, in line with European standards.
In other news Monday, UN war crimes tribunal President Fausto Pocar urged BiH authorities to speed up reforms in the judicial sector and the security services.
Meeting with members of the tripartite presidency in Sarajevo, Pocar said that the accelerated restructuring in these sectors would help in efforts to apprehend fugitives.

He is charged with committing crimes against humanity involving Bosniak civilians in the Rogatica municipality from May-November 1992.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County prosecutors filed a new war crimes indictment against Parliament member Branimir Glavas on Wednesday (May 9th), following a nearly yearlong investigation. 
Glavas is charged in connection with the murder of two ethnic Serb civilians and the torture of others in the eastern Croatian town of Osijek in 1991. 
At the time, he was the Osijek municipal defence secretary and commander of a local Croatian paramilitary formation. 
This is the second indictment against Glavas, who already faces trial before the Osijek county court for the murder of ten ethnic Serb civilians in the region in 1991.
In other news, the Croatian State Attorney's Office announced on Wednesday that war crimes probes had been launched against a total of 3,666 people since 1991. 
In 98.3% of the cases, charges were related to involvement in the aggression against Croatia, while 1.7% represented proceedings launched against members of the Croatian armed forces.
Also Wednesday, a Thessaloniki court approved the extradition of a Croatian Serb paramilitary member, Ernest Radjen, from Greece to Croatia, where he is charged with the 1991 killings of over 40 Croat civilians in Skabrnja. 
He denies the accusations.

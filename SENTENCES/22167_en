BUCHAREST, Romania -- The senate approved an amendment to the law on prosecutor-appointing procedures Tuesday (September 16th) by a vote of 78 to 46.
Under the amendment, the president will no longer name the chief prosecutors in the Anti-Corruption Prosecution Office, the Organised Crime and Terrorism Investigation Department, and the Prosecution Office of the High Court of Justice.
The Supreme Council of Magistrates would handle nominations instead.
The amendment also envisions that chief prosecutors and their deputies must have a minimum of ten years' experience.

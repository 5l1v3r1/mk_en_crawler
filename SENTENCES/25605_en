BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) does not support holding a referendum on Macedonia's name, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (October 22nd). 
He was attending a discussion on EU enlargement in Brussels alongside Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Vasko Naumovski. 
Rehn warned that holding a referendum on complex issues related to EU enlargement is a "Pandora's box".
Meanwhile, the EU representative to Skopje, Erwan Fouere, and Swedish Ambassador Lars Freden on Thursday urged Macedonia to ramp up talks with Greece on the long-standing name dispute, ahead of the next Council of the EU in December. 
That is when a decision on starting membership talks with Skopje is expected.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The parliamentary committee on mandates and immunity on Wednesday (October 20th) approved a request by former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to have his mandate as lawmaker re-activated.
He is to return to parliament on Friday.
Sanader unexpectedly resigned as prime minister last July.
He was expelled from the senior-ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party when he first suggested that he might attempt a comeback in January.
Local media reports suggest that he mantains close associates within the HDZ ranks, which could give him indirect influence in the decision-making process.
Reactivating his mandate also offers him immunity, amid allegations of corruption.
The parliamentary committee also accepted a request by former customs chief Mladen Barisic for the activation and immediate suspension of his mandate as a member of parliament.
Barisic was arrested earlier this month and charged with corruption, abuse of position and illegal mediation.

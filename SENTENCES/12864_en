BUCHAREST, Romania -- Over 1.7 million Bucharest residents were expected to go to polling stations to cast their vote for a new mayor Sunday (3 April). 
The post has been vacant since Traian Basescu was elected president in December. 
The latest polls show former Deputy Prime Minister Adriean Videanu of the ruling coalition is the frontrunner, with around 36 per cent of public support. 
Opposition candidate Marian Vanghelie, the incumbent mayor of Bucharest District 5, was second in the polls with 24 per cent.

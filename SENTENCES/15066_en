PARIS, France -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte is urging the EU to suspend negotiations with Belgrade on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro published Monday (31 January), she said Serbia would arrest Bosnian wartime military commander Ratko Mladic only under strong pressure from the EU, noting Croatia finally began co-operating under similar circumstances.
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic warned, however, that mounting pressure on Serbia over Kosovo and Mladic could be counterproductive.
He urged the West to end the "humiliation" of the Serb people, as it only encouraged extreme nationalists.
The Serbia-Montenegro Council of Ministers and the Supreme Defence Council reportedly will address the issue of co-operation separately Friday.

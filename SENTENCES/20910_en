PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A major fire broke out Saturday (August 4th) in the centre of Podgorica, threatening one of the most expensive and luxurious neighbourhoods in the city.
Firefighters say their job has been complicated by strong wings which are fanning the flames.
The cause is under investigation.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Predrag Popovic was re-elected as leader of the opposition People's Party (NS) at an extraordinary congress Saturday (April 23rd). 
Popovic resigned from the post after he was stripped of Montenegrin citizenship. 
The interior ministry decided in March to deprive him of citizenship because he also holds a Serbian passport. 
The congress adopted a declaration stating that the NS will continue to work in defence of Serbian national interests in Montenegro. 
Popovic told the delegates that the party will continue to maintain friendly relations with Serbia, Republika Srpska and all Serbs.

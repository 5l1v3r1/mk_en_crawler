PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Prime Minister Agim Ceku said on Monday (April 9th) that the Kosovo government is prepared to meet all challenges related to state building, should the province get independence. 
Acknowledging the many political and economic challenges involved, he said that Kosovo Albanians are committed to achieving every step and that the government would actively work to protect the interest of all Kosovo citizens. 
His comment coincided with the start of discussions by the UN Security Council regarding special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's proposal to resolve Kosovo's status. 
At Russia's request, a Security Council mission plans to visit Belgrade and Pristina before any vote on Ahtisaari's proposal.
Serbia, meanwhile, is launching a diplomatic effort to scuttle the blueprint. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic is currently visiting South Africa, one of the ten non-permanent members of the Security Council, to press its case against Kosovo independence.

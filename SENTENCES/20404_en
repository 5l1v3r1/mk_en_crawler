BUCHAREST, Romania -- There is no link between a phone call to a Romanian number by one of the September 11th hijackers and the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, a spokesman for the Romanian intelligence service said on Tuesday (September 11th), the sixth anniversary of the attacks.
He was responding to a report in the French daily Liberation that quoted a secret FBI report detailing the movements of all 9/11 terrorists.
Terrorist leader Mohammed Atta allegedly made a phone call to Romania shortly before the attacks.
The spokesman said the intelligence service had clarified the matter and saw no reason for further action.
Meanwhile, RFI Romania reported on Wednesday that the number Atta allegedly dialed prior the attacks was actually not Romanian, but belonged to Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, a close ally of Atta's, in Frankfurt, which has a similar calling code.

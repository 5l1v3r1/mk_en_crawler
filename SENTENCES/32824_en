BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson has further reduced the Air Safety Zone between Yugoslavia and Kosovo, says Deputy Serbian Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic.
The no-fly zone, instituted in 1999, was originally 25km, then reduced to 10km and is now only 5km.
The zone was created to prevent Serbian air strikes on Kosovo.
Covic, who is also Belgrade's co-ordinator in Kosovo, says it might be removed altogether.
Meanwhile, Robertson is expected to arrive in Kosovo on Wednesday (4 December), according to the Albanian news agency ATA.
He is expected to discuss security issues.

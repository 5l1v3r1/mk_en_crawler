GRACANICA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The Serb National Council of Kosovo expressed strong concern Monday (December 25th) about plans by Decani municipal authorities to build a highway to Montenegro that would pass through the Serb Orthodox monastery of Visoki Decani, as well as about a proposed factory in the protected zone.
The Council said the plans are a clear signal that local Albanian authorities are unwilling to protect Serbian cultural and religious monuments.
The Council urged both UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker and UNESCO to intervene.

PARIS, France -- A draft resolution adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's (PACE) monitoring committee on Wednesday (15 September) criticises Serbia-Montenegro for not meeting the Council of Europe's (CoE) requirements, according to Belgrade media reports.
It also reportedly reiterates the need for full co-operation regarding war crimes indictees.
The document is to be voted on during the PACE session in early October.
The draft resolution notes in particular the failure of the two republics to adjust their main laws and harmonise them with the federal union's constitution.
Serbia-Montenegro officially obtained CoE membership last April.

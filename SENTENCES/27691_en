PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) decided on Thursday (November 25th) to nominate leader Hashim Thaci to a second term as prime minister if the party wins the December 12th snap elections.
Both campaigning and the vote itself will be monitored by over 150 international observers from the European network of election monitoring organisations, ENEMO.
A team of nine is already in Pristina.

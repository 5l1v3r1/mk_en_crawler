PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegro will hold its much anticipated independence referendum on 30 April, Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic said Saturday (11 February). 
He said parliament is certain to endorse the government's decision to hold the plebiscite on the last Sunday in April. 
EU special envoy Miroslav Lajcak has indicated he will deliver the Union's stance regarding the necessary majority to Podgorica on Wednesday. 
Lajcak told a local TV channel that Brussels has a position on the margin of victory needed for a "yes" vote to succeed, but its goal is not to impose solutions.

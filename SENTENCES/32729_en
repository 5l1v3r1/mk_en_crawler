TIRANA, Albania -- The governments of Yugoslavia and Albania will work to overcome longstanding disputes, according to Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic and Yugoslav National and Ethnic Communities Minister Rasim Ljajic, who visited Tirana on Sunday (15 December).
They met with Foreign Minister Ilir Meta and discussed, among other things, 12 bilateral agreements for creation of a legal framework promoting economic co-operation.
Ljajic said that Yugoslavia is ready to sign a bilateral agreement on the protection of national minorities, similar to the one recently signed with Romania.
During their meeting, the officials also discussed progress towards stabilisation and democratisation in Kosovo and pledged co-operation in solving its remaining problems.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Thousands of miners protested for a second day Wednesday (20 April), demanding changes to the privatisation process in the mining industry. 
The protesters, who held rallies and blocked roads across the country, say privatisation in its current form would leave nearly 11,000 people jobless. 
The protests are to continue until 27 April.

TIRANA, Albania -- The local elections process set for May 8th should set a good example, head of the Central Election Commission Arben Ristani said on Sunday (January 16th). 
"We hope that political parties, which I believe love this country, will try to secure high-standard elections, otherwise it will be 'suicide' for them," Ristani told a TV interview. 
Commenting on polemics regarding irregularities in the 2009 general elections, Ristani accused political parties of ignoring an appraisal by the OSCE which described the vote as the best held in the country so far. 
As for burning the ballot boxes, a process that was strongly criticised by the opposition, Ristani said the commission was following the policy of the Elections Law, as part of preparations for the May elections.

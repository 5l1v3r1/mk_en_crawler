SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Tuesday (February 15th) that he will not try to freeze the salaries of BiH politicians over their failure to form a government. 
Inzko has the right to make the move under the so-called Bonn Powers, but told OBN television that he would rather see politicians reach a compromise. 
They have been unable to form a government since the October general elections.

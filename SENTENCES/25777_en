NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told Cypriot lawmakers on Tuesday (October 20th) that Turkey should reconsider its military presence in the ethnically divided island if it wants to join the EU.
"Relations should not be based on military force or threats, but on European principles and mutual commitments," Papandreou said.
"Greece and Cyprus will insist that Turkey fully implement its commitments by December, when the Council of Europe will issue its report on Ankara's progress." (Express, Zaman, Cyprus Mail - 21/10/09;

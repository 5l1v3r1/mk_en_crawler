BELGRADE, Serbia -- It is unlikely that Serbia can start EU accession talks this year, the head of the European Commission (EC) Delegation to Belgrade, Josep Lloveras, said on Friday (March 27th). 
Overall, the process required to start those talks could last around 10-12 months, so it is practically impossible for the country to open membership talks in 2009, Lloveras explained. 
He stated Serbia will certainly be in the EU within a decade.

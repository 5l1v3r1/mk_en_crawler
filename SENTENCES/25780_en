BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Lucian Croitoru told reporters on Monday (October 19th) that he will ask the Social Democratic Party (PSD) to suggest three candidates for interior minister, in hopes one of them is supported by parliament.
Croitoru has started negotiations with parliamentary parties, after his controversial nomination by President Traian Basescu last week.
On Monday, Croitoru negotiated exclusively with the Liberal Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, he meets with the opposition parties that last week supported Klaus Johannis, the mayor of Sibiu, for prime minister.
Croitoru had a hard time convincing leaders of the National Liberal Party, the PSD, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, and minority representatives to even meet with him.

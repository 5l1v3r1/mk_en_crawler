BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) leader Tomislav Nikolic announced on Saturday (April 16th) he has launched a hunger strike that will continue until the party's demand for early elections is met.
Nikolic was speaking at an anti-government demonstration in Belgrade attended by tens of thousands of people.
The SNS insists the snap vote should be called for December.
The next scheduled general elections are in May 2012.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian ruling coalition partner G17 Plus on Tuesday (6 July) urged President-elect Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) to join the government.
The current cabinet is made up of a bloc of democratic parties, excluding DS.
Cedomir Antic, a senior G17 Plus member, said it is essential that all democratic parties stand together in ruling the country.
In other news, it appears none of the four retired Serbian police and army generals charged by the UN war crimes tribunal have received their indictments, as was expected earlier this week.
The lawyer representing General Nebojsa Pavkovic says the length of the process does not surprise him.

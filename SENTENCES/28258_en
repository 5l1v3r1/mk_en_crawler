VIENNA, Austria -- A building housing Macedonia's mission to the OSCE in Vienna was evacuated on Monday (August 16th) after a bomb threat.
The mission was emptied after an anonymous caller warned that an explosive device had been planted in a car in front of the building.
The premises were reopened when police officers established that the threat was a hoax.

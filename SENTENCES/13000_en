ZAGREB, Croatia -- Local media reported on Thursday (29 September) that the EU task force on Croatia will meet early Monday.
Sources say the task force will include representatives of the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Austria and Finland, as well as EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.
Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte and the Croatian government delegation, led by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, will also be invited.
At issue is whether Croatia is demonstrating full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
A lack of co-operation could further delay EU accession talks.
In other news, officials have announced that the start of the so-called Vukovar Three trial has been delayed by one week at the request of defence attorneys.
It will now begin on 10 October.
Three former Serb Army officers -- Mile Mrksic, Miroslav Radic and Veselin Sljivancanin -- are charged in connection with the 1991 massacre of nearly 300 Croatians and other non-Serbs who were removed from the Vukovar hospital and killed in Ovcara.

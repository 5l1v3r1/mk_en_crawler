ANKARA, Turkey -- Medical and psychological tests have concluded that Alparslan Arslan, the alleged gunman in the 17 May attack on the Turkish Council of State, is sane, according to local media reports Saturday (19 August).
Arslan was taken from prison to the Ankara Numune Hospital for the court-ordered tests, following the start of the trial earlier this month.

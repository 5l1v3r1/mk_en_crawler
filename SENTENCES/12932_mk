SKOPJE, Macedonia -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen made a brief visit to Macedonia on Wednesday (1 June) and told Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski that the border demarcation process should be settled before discussions on Kosovo's status begin. 
Jessen-Petersen expects representatives of the Macedonian and Kosovo sides to meet next week in Pristina and consider ways to resolve the border demarcation process. 
The Kosovo interim government refuses to recognise a previous agreement sealed between Skopje and Belgrade.
In other news, the commander of NATO's Joint Force Command Naples, US Admiral Harry Ulrich, visited Pristina on Wednesday and reaffirmed the Alliance's commitment to preserving a safe and secure environment in Kosovo. 
Ulrich assumed the post in May.

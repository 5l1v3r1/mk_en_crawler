THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal sentenced Radislav Brdjanin, wartime leader of the autonomous Krajina region of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to 32 years in prison on Wednesday (1 September), but acquitted him of genocide. 
He was found guilty on eight out of 12 counts, including aiding and abetting torture, persecution and wilful killing, and instigating deportations and forcible transfers. 
At least 1,669 Muslim and Croat civilians were killed by Serb separatists in Krajina in the early stage of the 1992-1995 conflict, while others were held in prison camps or forced to flee. 
Muslim officials and activists expressed outrage over the verdict.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee adopted a pair of resolutions on Albania and Kosovo and their integration processes Wednesday (June 23rd). 
The one on Albania was adopted almost unanimously. 
It welcomed the country's progress but urged more efforts to curb corruption, which continues to be a "prevailing problem". 
It also calls for a solution to the ongoing political stalemate in Tirana. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha described it as a "historic" document in the country's EU visa liberalisation process.
The other resolution calls on EU member states that have not recognised Kosovo's independence to do so. 
It also urges local authorities and EULEX to demonstrate specific results in combating corruption and organised crime, including in high-level cases. 
The motion also supports the inclusion of Kosovo in the EU's visa liberalisation process.

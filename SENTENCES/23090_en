BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU accession of Croatia and Serbia is critical for stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said in a letter to his EU colleagues Sunday (November 2nd). 
He expressed concern about current tensions there and urged more attention to BiH and more support for the work of High Representative Miroslav Lajcak. 
He backed Lajcak's assessment that the "priority at this moment must be enabling a transition towards a strong and long-term EU presence in the country".
Bildt further added that despite recent tensions, the process of stabilisation in BiH should not be overlooked.

TIRANA, Albania -- A group of 11 lawmakers from the opposition Socialist Movement for Integration and Christian Democratic Party leader Nard Ndoka started a hunger strike Monday (November 10th) inside the parliament building. 
They are protesting the exclusion of small parties' representatives from election committees under the new election code. 
The hunger strikers accuse Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the main opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama of attempting to monopolise the election process.
In other news Monday, rescue teams recovered the bodies of three women under the rubble of a building that collapsed Sunday in the southern town of Gjirokastra. 
Investigators blame construction work on an adjacent building. 
President Bamir Topi and Prime Minister Sali Berisha promised prosecution of those responsible for low-quality construction in Gjirokastra.

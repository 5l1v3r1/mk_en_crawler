BERLIN, Germany -- The leaders of Germany, France and Turkey are meeting in Berlin on Tuesday (26 October) to discuss Ankara's EU membership bid. 
Both French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder have backed Turkey's accession; however, Chirac has also announced that France will hold a referendum on the issue. 
On Monday, Austrian President Heinz Fischer said the EU should start accession talks with Turkey in 2005, but said Ankara must do more to become fully "mature".
Also Monday, Britain's Prince Charles praised Turkey as a model of religious tolerance and said the country's bid to join the EU is an "extraordinary opportunity" to prove "that secular democracy does not have to come at the expense of Islamic values". 
He was speaking at the reopening of the British consulate in Istanbul, targeted by terrorists nearly a year ago.
In other news Monday, the Turkish government unveiled new banknotes and coins that will enter into circulation on 1 January. 
The new notes come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 and bear a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

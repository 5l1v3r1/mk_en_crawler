BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The second round of Serbia-Montenegro's technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU began in Belgrade on Wednesday (22 February).
Following the meeting, the head of the Serbian team, Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, said that the negotiations began under "the shadow of suspicion" that war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic was on Serbian territory and that the government knows his whereabouts but is reluctant to seize him.
In other news Wednesday, the presiding judge in Slobodan Milosevic's trial told the defendant to speed up his defence.
Milosevic has used four-fifths of his time focusing mostly on the Kosovo part of the trial, rather than addressing charges stemming from the wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

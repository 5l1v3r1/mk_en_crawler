SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A court sentenced six Bulgarians to prison Monday (March 29th) for financial fraud and embezzlement of about 7.5m euros granted the country under the EU's SAPARD programme. 
Businessman Mario Nikolov and his wife, Mariana, received sentences of ten and eight years respectively. 
The other four will each spend six years in prison. 
The court also ordered property to be confiscated with each defendant paying a fine of 15,000 euros. 
The network, involving 50 Bulgarian and various European offshore companies, was busted in a joint action by Bulgarian, German and Swiss police.
Separately Monday, the government announced that prosecutors are investigating ministers of the former Bulgarian Socialist Party-led government and other senior officials over suspected abuse of power in signing deals worth about 1.8 billion euros. 
The investigation involves 150 public procurement deals and other contracts signed by 13 ministries over the past three years.

LAGOS, Nigeria -- A Croatian national was abducted along with five other foreign workers in Nigeria on Tuesday (May 1st). 
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) issued a statement claiming responsibility for the kidnappings. 
It identified the Croatian hostage as Juricha Ruic. 
He and the others work for Chevron. 
MEND said it would free the hostages unconditionally on May 30th and warned that no attempts to pay ransom should be made. 
The purpose behind the kidnappings, it said, was to demonstrate that it does not support Nigerian President-elect Umaru Yar'Adua, as claimed in media reports. 
The group also wants to warn oil companies not to return to fields that had been targeted by MEND in the past.
Earlier this year, two Croatian citizens abducted by local rebels in Nigeria were released after three days.

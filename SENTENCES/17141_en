NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis said on Tuesday (October 31st) that Nicosia would participate in talks initiated by Finland regarding the Cyprus problem only if the so-called Varosha zone is returned to its "lawful" inhabitants. 
Varosha has been under Turkish military administration and fenced off since Turkish troops invaded Cyprus in 1974.
On Monday, Finland -- which holds the rotating EU presidency -- suggested that representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greece, Turkey and the EU meet in Helsinki early next week for talks.

JERUSALEM, Israel/ANKARA, Turkey -- Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak was quoted on Sunday (August 1st) as saying that the newly appointed chief of Turkey's secret services is a "supporter" of Iran.
"Turkey is a friendly country, a strategic ally, but the nomination in recent weeks of a new chief of the Turkish secret services who is a supporter of Iran worries us," Barak said at a meeting of his Labour Party.
According to him, the appointment of Hakan Fidan, 42, could give Iranians "access to secret information." Fidan was appointed as head of the National Intelligence Organisation on May 27th.
He was previously undersecretary for foreign affairs to the prime minister and represented Turkey at the International Atomic Energy Agency, playing a key role in Ankara's efforts to settle the Iranian nuclear programme issue.
In other news, military officials were quoted as saying Sunday that the army has decided to promote 11 generals and admirals charged with involvement in a plan to topple the government.
The men are part of a group of 102 retired and active duty officers who were issued arrest warrants last week in relation to a coup plot that was first revealed in February.

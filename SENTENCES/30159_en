BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban confirmed on Thursday (April 14th) that it is impossible for the EU to sign contracts with Kosovo as long as five EU member states do not recognise it as an independent state.
"Without recognition from all member states, there cannot be contractual relations with Kosovo," Orban said.
This will mean that Kosovo cannot sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Orban made the statement at a high-level meeting of the EU and Western Balkans parliamentarians in Brussels.
Kosovo was represented by Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi who called on the five countries to recognise Kosovo.

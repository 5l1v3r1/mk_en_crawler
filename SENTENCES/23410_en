TIRANA, Albania -- The foreign ministry on Wednesday (April 29th) denied a report of an agreement reached between Tirana and Athens that gives Albanian territorial waters to Greece.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha signed an agreement with counterpart Costas Karamanlis earlier in the week that neither side has made public.
Local media reported that under the deal, Albania has agreed to give 225 sq km of territorial waters to its southern neighbour.
"We reject the unfounded, misleading and ill-wishing inaccurate information published in an Albanian daily newspaper on the so-called 'shrinkage of the strategic position of the Albanian state'" allegedly resulting from the Agreement on the Delineation of the Continental Shelf and the Maritime Zone, the foreign and defence ministries said in a joint statement.

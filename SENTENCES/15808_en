ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's Foreign and EU Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic expects the accession negotiations with the EU to be completed by the end of 2008. 
In an interview published Friday (21 July) by Poslovni dnevnik, she said the current EU screening process for the Croatian legislation's harmonisation with EU laws should be finalised in October, after which the concrete talks on the chapters would open.
In other news, prosecutors demanded Thursday that former Croatian Democratic Union leader Branimir Glavas, who is currently under investigation for alleged war crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991, be placed in custody. 
Citing Glavas's public revelation of witness testimony, the prosecutors said he was attempting to influence future witnesses.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown demanded on Thursday (19 January) that the Republika Srpska (RS) government establish a commission to investigate the disappearance of Zepa wartime commander Avdo Palic.
He has been classified as a missing person since 1995, when he was taken away from the army prison in Bijeljina.
In a letter to RS Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic, Ashdown said a report by the commission is expected in three months.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- General Ante Gotovina has asked to postpone an initiative in the city of Split to declare him an honourary citizen and to name a street or a square after him, media reported on Tuesday (April 26th). 
The initiative was approved on April 21st at a session of the Split City Council, a week after the UN tribunal convicted Gotovina of war crimes stemming from the 1995 military operation Storm. 
The court found him guilty of almost all charges and sentenced him to 24 years in prison, concluding that he participated in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at forcibly and permanently removing the ethnic Serb population from the Krajina region of Croatia.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prosecutor Zekeriya Oz has demanded sentences of life imprisonment for the four key suspects in the 2003 Istanbul bombings that killed over 60 people and left 700 injured, according to an announcement Tuesday (28 June), a day after Oz presented his closing argument. 
He said that the four suspects -- Fevzi Yitiz, Adnan Ersoz, Yusuf Polat and Harun Ilhan -- attempted to "change the Constitutional order by force". 
Prosecutors say the four are leaders of a radical Islamic group purportedly linked to the al-Qaeda terror network. 
Bombers targeted two synagogues, the British Consulate and the Turkish headquarters of the HSBC Bank in November 2003.

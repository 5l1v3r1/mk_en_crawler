BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The privatisation procedure for Republika Srpska's (RS) fixed-line phone operator Telekom Srpske sparked controversy between the Serb and the Bosniak blocs in the entity legislature late last week, according to local media reports.
On Thursday (13 July), Bosniak delegates to the RS House of Peoples, who oppose the government's privatisation strategy for the telco, launched a procedure for the constitutional protection of vital national interests.
The delegates said Bosniak employees would be left jobless by the sale, and that measures to protect them were inadequate.
The main Serb parties -- the ruling Union of Independent Social Democrats, the major opposition Serb Democratic Party and the Party of Democratic Progress -- condemned the Bosniak caucus's move, which they described as an effort to stall the crucial privatisation process for Telekom Srpske and wreak economic damage.

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Greece, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria signed an agreement Monday (16 December) establishing a common energy market. 
The initiative, under the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, aims to include the whole Balkan region. 
A similar document was signed by Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Yugoslavia last November in Athens. 
Under the common agreement, the member countries have pledged readiness to modernise and develop their power grids by 2005, when a common market is to be established.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Seven miners were killed and five were injured in a blast at the state-run coal mine in Anina, western Romania on Saturday (14 January).
Three of the wounded were reported in serious condition.
The blast happened at about 5:30am local time, and was blamed on a leak of gas methane.
The Anina coal mine, 230 years old and 1,200m deep, is the oldest such facility still in service in Romania, and is one of Europe's deepest.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said that Serbia would sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU if invited to do so, according to an interview Friday (January 4th) with B92.
Djelic said there is no link between Serbia's EU integration process and resolving Kosovo's final status.
"Only a strong Serbia that has a strong economy, many allies, is integrated into the world and is present in international organisations is a Serbia that can protect its own interests, including its territorial integrity," said Djelic, of the Democratic Party (DS).
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, from the other senior ruling coalition ally, the Democratic Party of Serbia, said last week that any EU deployment of a police and judicial mission to Kosovo would annul an SAA.
In other news, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Sunday that Belgrade would prevent an imposed solution on Kosovo.
He said that in addition to Russia and China, South Africa, Indonesia and three other countries that recently joined the UN Security Council would support Serbia's position during the next Security Council debate scheduled for January 16th.

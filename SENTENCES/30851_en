BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Thursday (December 9th) that disputes in the Western Balkans should be resolved and should not block the integration process.
Opening a conference on the EU integration of the Western Balkan countries, he warned that challenges such as organised crime and corruption require strengthened regional co-operation and more reforms.
Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic told conference participants that Belgrade is ready for dialogue with Pristina, saying he is confident that a mutually acceptable solution could be found.
A frozen conflict is a very poor solution, Cvetkovic pointed out.
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who also took part in the conference, called on the EU to send a clear message to Western Balkan countries confirming that the enlargement process will continue.
The conference was organised by the Friends of Europe and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned on Tuesday (19 April) that Montenegro's potential independence would not accelerate the process of EU entry for the smaller republic but would probably have a reverse effect on the EU integration prospects of both Montenegro and Serbia. 
According to Rehn, who paid visits to Belgrade and Podgorica this week, Montenegro's departure from the federal union would likely complicate the pace of negotiations. 
He urged Podgorica to step up efforts to strengthen its institutions and judiciary, and to reform its public administration in line with EU standards. 
He also urged more efforts against corruption and organised crime.

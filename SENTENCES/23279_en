BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Orthodox Church has fired a priest who headed a drug addiction treatment centre, after videos were broadcast showing the priest beating patients. 
Bishop Artemije announced the move Wednesday (May 27th). 
The centre, situated in the Crna Reka monastery about 300km southwest of Belgrade, may be shut down if investigators determine violence occurs there. 
It is open for the time being, despite the Holy Synod's insistence it close due to numerous complaints by patients and their parents. 
There are around 200 people currently receiving treatment in the centre.
In other news Wednesday, Serbia's war crimes court sentenced Boro Trbojevic to ten years in prison for crimes against Croat civilians in 1991. 
Prosecutors say he was involved in taking hostages, separating men from women and killing civilians in a school in Velika Peratovica that was used as a civilian prison at the time. 
The case is one of 12 that have been transferred to Serbia's war crimes court, based on a co-operation agreement between the two countries.

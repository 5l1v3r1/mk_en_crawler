SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Speaking Saturday (August 25th) on the 130th anniversary of the Shipka Epopee, one of the most important battles in Bulgarian history, President Georgi Parvanov rejected the idea of establishing an ethnically based national guard.
"We can imagine what would happen if each ethnos begins to create such a guard.
This is the shortest way to ethnic and religious confrontation," Parvanov said, adding that he is ready to act as a mediator in efforts to reduce ethnic tensions between Bulgarians and Roma.
The president's comments were in response to a recent Roma revolt in Sofia's Krasna Polyana district.
At least 200 Roma, carrying axes, cudgels, pitchforks and stones, sought to retaliate against a group of skinheads who injured a Roma teenager a couple of weeks ago.

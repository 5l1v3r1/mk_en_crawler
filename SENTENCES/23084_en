ATHENS, Greece -- Military co-operation between Greece and Cyprus is on an excellent track, defence ministers of the two countries agreed during a meeting Monday (June 2nd) in Athens.
Both ministers -- Greece's Evangelos Meimarakis and Cyprus' Kostas Papakostas -- agreed there could be even more co-operation.
Meimarakis assured his Cypriot counterpart that Greece is actively involved in all issues related to Cyprus's security and efforts to resolve its long-standing division in accordance with UN resolutions and EU principles.
The two officials also discussed international military manoeuvres currently under way in Cyprus.
Papakostas said Turkish Cypriot protests against the Argonaftis military drills, which started on Monday, are unwarranted.
Last week, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat protested the drills, saying they were unwelcome, especially since the two communities on the divided island were working to revive reunification talks.

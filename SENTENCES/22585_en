BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government may pull Romanian troops from Iraq on January 1st, unless the Iraqi government decides by early December to extend the country's mandate, Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu said on Tuesday (November 11th). 
He noted the multinational force's mandate expires on December 30th. 
"If no political decision is made by early December at the latest, it will be quite hard to presume we will continue to efficiently carry out our mission in Iraq," Melescanu said. 
In the meantime, he said the defence ministry is examining various deployment scenarios.

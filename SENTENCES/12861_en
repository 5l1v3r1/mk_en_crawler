LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Wednesday (1 December) that his government believes the EU summit on 17 December will set a date for launching accession talks with Ankara.
He expressed confidence that Turkey would eventually join the Union, but warned that negotiations -- particularly on agriculture â€“ would be long and difficult.
Gul met with his current Slovenian counterpart, Ivo Vajgl, and with Dimitrij Rupel, who is due to take over the foreign portfolio when the new Slovenian government is sworn in.
In other news, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said they oppose proposals to grant Turkey privileged partner status rather than full membership.
Verhofstadt was in Berlin for talks with his German counterpart.

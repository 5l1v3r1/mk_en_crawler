PARIS, France -- Parliament's upper house, the Senate, rejected an institutional reform draft Monday (June 23rd) aimed at introducing a referendum on Turkey's EU membership.
The lower house approved the measure in late May.
Senators, however, criticised it as "abusive" and "discriminatory" towards an "an ally and a friend" of France.
President Nicolas Sarkozy opposes Turkey's EU membership, claiming that the country is not located in Europe.
Instead of full membership, he backs a "privileged partnership" status for Turkey.
Ankara insists on full accession.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU officials said in Brussels on Wednesday (February 28th) that membership talks with Croatia are moving in the right direction, during a meeting to prepare for the EU-Croatia joint parliamentary committee's session in Zagreb in three weeks. 
According to representatives of the European Parliament and the European Commission, Croatia has made progress in its EU accession process. 
They called on Croatian authorities to continue implementing reforms and to ensure that parliamentary elections later this year would not jeopardise the negotiation process with the Union. 
The upcoming EU-Croatia joint parliamentary committee session will focus on judicial and public administration reforms, legislative activities, anti- corruption efforts and processing war crimes cases.

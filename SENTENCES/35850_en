TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano called for state institutions to step up the fight against crime, during a meeting Friday (23 January) with leaders of the intelligence service, SHISH. 
Nano stressed that SHISH, police, prosecutors, the army and the customs bureau should all work hand in hand to curb organised crime and trafficking. 
He acknowledged progress over the past 18 months, but said there should be "a far more professional framework of collaboration between the chains of SHISH itself, between SHISH and other partner services, as well as with other specialised agencies of the state".

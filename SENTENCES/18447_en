ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A bomb hidden under a bench shattered windows in Istanbul's Bakirkoy district Sunday (June 10th), wounding 14 people. 
The city's police chief, Celalettin Cerrah, said flying glass accounted for most of the injuries. 
A similar blast on the same street injured 31 people a year ago.
The attack came amid renewed tensions in eastern Turkey. 
The military has recently stepped up its presence in provinces bordering on Iraq, in a bid to prevent Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists from entering Turkey. 
In response, the PKK has threatened that Turks "will pay a high price".Chief of General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit, meanwhile, predicts more PKK attacks might follow in other Turkish cities.
In a separate incident, three Kurdish rebels and a village guard were killed in a firefight during a military operation in the Diyarbakir province.

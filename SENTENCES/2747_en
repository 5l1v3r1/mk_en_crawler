The Croatian government is conducting an investigation into the sale of some 5,100 rockets to Macedonia in 2001. 
The transaction, which resulted in a loss of more than 2m euros to the Croatian Defence Ministry, became public knowledge more than four years after the fact.
Djuro Djakovic Alatnica, a Croatian military equipment producer, negotiated the deal to sell rockets to Macedonia. 
However, the company did not have the necessary quantity of rockets in stock, so it "borrowed" them from the Croatian military. 
The five-year-old rockets were apparently then refurbished and delivered to Macedonia under the pretense that they were brand new.
The proceeds from the sale were never paid to the Croatian Ministry of Defence, nor were the rockets returned to Croatia. 
An army officer reported the missing rockets to the military police, but no action was taken.
Former Defence Minister Jozo Rados has acknowledged that the rockets were lent to Djuro Djakovic Alatnica, but denies any knowledge of what happened to them later.
At the time, Macedonia was in the throes of an interethnic conflict. 
The sale violated an embargo on arm sales, affecting not only Macedonia but all the former Yugoslav republics.
Defence Minster Berislav Roncevic has reported the case to the State Attorney's Office, which launched a probe. 
"The investigation is being led by the Zagreb district attorney's office, civil and military police," the daily Vecernji List quoted Martina Mihordin, spokeswoman for the state attorney's office, as saying.
"It was a crime, and the institutions should find who was guilty of it," said Croatian President Stipe Mesic.
The scandal has alarmed Croatians, not only because of the apparent theft, but also because their country's armed forces were seemingly unaware of the disappearance of thousands of deadly rockets.

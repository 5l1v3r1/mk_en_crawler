SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative and EU Special Representative Miroslav Lajcak, European Commission Delegation to BiH head and Ambassador Dimitris Kourkoulas and French Ambassador Maryse Berniau urged the BiH government to accelerate strengthening the rule of law and reforming the state property system.
These are the two conditions that the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) requires before it will transform the Office of the High Representative (OHR) into an office of the EU Special Representative.
The EU envoys, who attended a session of the BiH Council of Ministers on EU integration in Jahorina on Tuesday (June 11th), also welcomed progress on three objectives:
the agreement on movable defence property, the adoption of the fiscal council law and the adoption of the judicial reform strategy.
They urged the government to boost efforts to meet remaining requirements.

ATHENS, Greece -- US Ambassador to Greece Charles Ries said in a press interview that a final settlement of the Cyprus issue would prevent other problems, such as the ongoing oil exploration dispute between Turkey and Cyprus.
In the interview, published in the Greek press on Sunday (February 11th), Ries again voiced the US hope that last summer's UN-mediated initiative for resuming the Cyprus talks would be fruitful.
Also at the weekend, Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said he was reassured by Egypt and Lebanon that they would not withdraw from their accords sealed with Cyprus regarding the planned establishment of an exclusive economic zone for oil exploration.
Turkey has reacted strongly to the plan, arguing that the rights of Turkish Cypriots should be taken into account, and warning Lebanon and Egypt against proceeding with the project.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has sent a letter to EU Special Representative and International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith, informing him that the government will no longer allow Serb officials to visit Kosovo, local media reported on Wednesday (August 18th). 
In his letter, Thaci said that he does not want this to be seen as an effort to prevent freedom of movement between two countries, rather, as a measure to prevent the political provocations that have occurred during previous visits. 
He added that Thursday's visit by Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic will be scrubbed, as will all other visits requested by Serbian officials. 
Officials at the EU Special Representative office said only that the decision to allow or bar such visits is exclusively the right of the Kosovo government.

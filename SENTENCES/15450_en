SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) police announced on Saturday (24 September) that they cracked a BiH-Montenegrin criminal group involved in bankcard forgery. 
Last late week, police arrested two BiH citizens and one Montenegrin. 
Another Montenegrin citizen is being sought. 
The FBiH Interior Ministry and police in the Una-Sana and Sarajevo Cantons conducted the action jointly.
In other news, officials say five police officers and three customs officers were detained on drug trafficking and cigarette smuggling charges in Albania late last week. 
The arrests were the result of an ongoing regional anti-trafficking operation, conducted by Albania, Greece and Macedonia.

TIRANA, Albania -- EU Integration Minister Majlinda Bregu says Albania will apply for the status of EU candidate early this year.
Her announcement Thursday (January 15th) came a day after Greece approved Albania's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, thus becoming the last member state to ratify the pre-accession accord.
In other news, Canada ratified the protocols Wednesday for Albania and Croatia's NATO membership.
Both hope to join the Alliance at its next summit in April.

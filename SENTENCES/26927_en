PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The OSCE mission in Pristina said Tuesday (August 4th) that it will not help organise Kosovo's local elections in November, despite strong backing from Belgrade.
Edita Bucaj, OSCE mission acting spokeswoman, noted that the organisation no longer has a mandate to take the lead role;
instead, it can only advise and help the Central Election Commission.
Belgrade has urged Serbs in Kosovo not to take part in the election.

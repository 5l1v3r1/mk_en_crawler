Macedonia has approved a detailed plan to transfer responsibilities and resources from the central government to local levels, starting on 1 July.
A total of 489 state-level institutions will be transferred to municipal authority, thus completing the process of decentralisation.
The institutions to be affected by the change include 356 primary schools, 81 secondary schools, 48 organisations in the area of culture, and four homes for the elderly.
In addition, the plan incorporates kindergartens.
The ministry of labour and welfare policy is currently preparing a new network of pre-school institutions.
Under the plan, 26,395 people employed in public institutions will be transferred to the local level.
About 9,078 are from primary schools, 6,654 from secondary schools, 556 from cultural organisations and 107 from homes for the elderly.
In addition, about 30,000 civil servants will be transferred, along with 270 employees of government ministries -- 117 from the finance ministry, 126 from the public revenue office and 27 from the education ministry.
After a law on physical and urban planning is enacted, the number of transport and communications ministry employees to be engaged in municipalities will be disclosed.
A total of 742 firemen now working for the interior ministry will be transferred to 29 regional fire centres and to Skopje.
Salaries will be provided from the original municipal revenues for funding, collected through property taxes, VAT, personal taxes and local taxes.
By 2007, the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers, as well as teachers and nurses in pre-school institutions and cultural institutions, will be paid from the state budget.
By that time, authorities estimate, 90 per cent of municipalities will have shown they have management capacity, enabling them to receive funds from block subsidies.
The money will be deposited in the municipal accounts for each area, and the municipalities will distribute it internally.

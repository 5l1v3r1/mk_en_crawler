TIRANA, Albania -- Accusations of corruption are flying between the government and opposition. 
On Wednesday (September 1st), opposition Socialist Party (SP) representatives again accused government officials of corruption and of benefitting from state contracts. 
In Turn, lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party (DP) accused SP leader and Tirana Mayor Edi Rama of corruption and bribes. 
News bulletins chronicle the allegations coming from both camps. 
SP members claim that 240 concessions granted to build hydro-plants in the country over the past five years are part of private deals that line the pockets of government officials and their relatives.
The officials targeted include Economy Minister Dritan Prifti, Integrations Minister Majlinda Bregu and lawmaker Albana Vokshi. 
Reacting to the attacks, DP representatives accused Rama of receiving bribes of up to 20% of the value of a new apartment block in exchange for construction licenses. 
Prosecutors now want some of the businessmen mentioned to make official statements regarding the allegations. 
Economy Minister Prifti says such accusations are "scaring away" investors and banks.

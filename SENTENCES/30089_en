SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A bank robber attacked a branch of a bank in the city of Sliven on Wednesday (March 23rd), seriously wounding a guard and taking five hostages in the worst hostage drama in Bulgaria's recent history.
By Thursday, the robber had released all five hostages.
Police have cordoned off the area, and authorities are saying little, concerned the robber may be reading or listening to media reports.

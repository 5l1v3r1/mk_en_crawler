PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Two EULEX vehicles were heavily damaged in Gjilan/Gnjilane, eastern Kosovo, on Wednesday (September 16th) after attackers threw Molotov cocktails at them. 
EULEX spokesperson Christophe Lamfalussy described it as an isolated incident. 
The attack came less than a week after EULEX and Serbia signed a protocol on police-co-operation, spurring strong criticism from Kosovo's institutions. 
In late August, 28 EULEX vehicles were damaged during a protest by members of the Vetevendosje (Self Determination) movement.
Meanwhile, the Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore reported on Thursday that EULEX has asked Kosovo police to sign a memorandum of understanding, which would give the EU-led mission access to data possessed by local law enforcement institutions. 
"EULEX is seeking to establish a permanent system that would allow ad-hoc requests for access to information," a source said.

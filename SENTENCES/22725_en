PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovo government on Wednesday (July 9th) asked the international community in Pristina and Belgrade to pacify northern Kosovo in order to enable legal institutions there to exercise their authority. 
"I am in continuous contact with [Mitrovica] Mayor Bajram Rexhepi, and we are undertaking necessary measures," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said. 
In Mitrovica, Rexhepi gave an ultimatum to UNMIK to solve the situation in the village of Suhadoll, where a pipeline project triggered inter-ethnic brawls between Albanians and Serbs, injuring several people.
In additional news, the International Civilian Office published a guide on Wednesday for the implementation of the plan on the Kosovo status settlement by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
Also in Pristina, the OSCE mission on Wednesday called upon Kosovo institutions to implement the law on languages which, according to the mission, they have yet to implement, and recommended schools provide classes in Serbian as well.

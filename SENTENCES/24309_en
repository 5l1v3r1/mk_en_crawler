PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Heads of institutions are urging Serb members of the Kosovo Police Service to return to work as the Thursday (May 15th) deadline approaches. 
Police head Sheremet Ahmeti and government spokesperson Memli Krasniqi said on Monday that the salaries will run out on Friday unless they resume work. 
Mass termination looms on June 30th. 
Serbs boycotted the force after Pristina declared its independence in February 2008.
In other news Monday, the Anticorruption Agency said 22 of a total 800 public officials have failed to file their asset declarations for 2008. 
Court personnel lead the list of those who have failed to comply, followed by government officials, particularly in the health ministry. 
Polls suggest the health and judicial systems have reputations as the most corrupt public sectors.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha indicated on Wednesday (February 3rd) that he is ready to sit down with opposition leader Edi Rama if President Bamir Topi organises the meeting.
A possible round table of all major political parties has been suggested in to find a way out of the political crisis that that has stymied reforms since the June 2009 elections.
The opposition, led by the SP, has been boycotting the work of parliament since September, insisting on a thorough investigation into the election.
SP leader Edi Rama says he too will participate in a meeting mediated by Topi.

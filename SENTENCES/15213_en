ANKARA, Turkey -- At least 27 people, including ten British tourists, were injured in four separate bombings in the Mediterranean resort of Marmaris and in Istanbul late Sunday (27 August). 
Three bombs went off nearly simultaneously around midnight in Marmaris, when the streets were crowded with tourists. 
The strongest blast demolished a shuttle bus ferrying tourists along one of the main streets. 
The other two bombs were placed in garbage bins. 
So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but Governor Temel Kocaklar insisted police would find the perpetrators. 
Security measures have been tightened and additional forces have been called in to check vehicles entering and leaving the town.
A separate bomb went off Sunday in Istanbul near a school in the Bagcilar district, injuring six more people. 
Local press reports link the attacks to the radical militant group Kurdistan Freedom Falcons. 
The group has claimed responsibility for 12 bombings this year that have killed six people and injured more than 100.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal has turned down a request by Serbian Radical Party (SRS) leader Vojislav Seselj to hold a telephone press conference, Serbian media reported on Thursday (January 14th). 
As his trial resumed Tuesday after a year-long delay, Seselj asked to be allowed to address Serbian journalists ahead of January 24th elections in the Odzaci municipality. 
At The Hague, he is charged with war crimes against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

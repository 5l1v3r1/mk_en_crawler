NEW YORK, United States -- The NGO Human Rights Watch released a set of benchmarks Thursday (8 January) to monitor Croatia's progress in the return of refugees and accountability for war crimes. 
Rachel Denber, acting director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division, said those two issues would determine Croatia's path to European integration. 
The benchmarks focus on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague and genuine efforts to prosecute those not tried in The Hague.
In other news Thursday, US President George W. 
Bush awarded the Legion of Merit to Croatian Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Josip Lucic. 
Bush cited Lucic's contribution to the reform of the Croatian military, the fight against international terrorism, and Croatia's deployment in Afghanistan.

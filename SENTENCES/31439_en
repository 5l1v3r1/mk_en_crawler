BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Serbian Parliament will vote on the new Constitutional Charter on Monday (27 January), according to Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
He said Sunday that the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia had already secured the necessary simple majority. 
Legislators also must approve the law on implementing the new constitution, already publicly rejected by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's party. 
Montenegro's Parliament is expected to approve the charter and implementation law on Tuesday, sending it on for a vote in Yugoslavia's Federal Parliament.
Under the terms of the new constitution, the Yugoslav central bank would be absorbed by Serbia's central bank. 
Serbian Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic threatened Sunday to resign if Yugoslav Central Bank Governor Mladjan Dinkic is dismissed, insisting that as the current team at the central bank has conducted complicated negotiations with the IMF and the Paris Club of creditors, it would be unwise to break it up.

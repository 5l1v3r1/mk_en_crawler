BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's newest party, the Serb Progressive Party (SNS) -- formed by former Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic -- has no plans to participate in a possible government shuffle, Nikolic said on Monday (January 5th). 
He added the party prefers to remain in opposition. 
There is growing speculation about possible government changes due to deteriorating relations between G17 Plus and its government partners. 
G17 Plus clashed with the Democratic Party and smaller parties first over the 2009 budget and later over an energy sector co-operation agreement signed with Russia in late December, which G17 Plus says is detrimental to Serbia.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police reported on Friday (23 July) that they have broken up a major narcotics smuggling ring and seized 66 kg of heroin.
Four suspects were arrested.
The ring, which allegedly specialised in supplying drugs to criminal groups in the West, had been under surveillance for some time.
Police seized its latest shipment, which had come from Turkey, while it was being transported to the border with Hungary.
Officials say the drugs were to be sold in Spain.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister-designate Nikola Gruevski confirmed on Friday (28 July) that the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) probably won't be part of the new coalition government.
Talking to reporters after receiving the mandate from President Branko Crvenkovski, Gruevski said his party has chosen the Democratic Party of Albanians as a coalition partner and is considering the smaller Party of Democratic Prosperity.
On Saturday, DUI leader Ali Ahmeti accused the VMRO-DPMNE of ignoring the wishes of ethnic Albanian voters, most of whom backed DUI in the 5 July election.

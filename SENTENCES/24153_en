NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Reunification of the divided island "must be a Cypriot solution", US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza said on Wednesday (January 14th) after meeting with President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. 
"The solution ... 
will have to be designed and built exclusively by the people who live here in Cyprus," he stressed. 
Washington, he said, will not become directly involved in ongoing negotiations between the two Cypriot communities but could help both sides find "the right mix of ideas at the right moment".

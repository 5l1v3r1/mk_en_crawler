PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon welcomed on Monday (March 1st) the government's decision to establish a task force to fight corruption.
Legal structures must be established to ensure that the local judiciary can efficiently fight corruption, de Kermabon said.
Opposition lawmakers are sceptical.
Besa Gaxherri, of the Democratic League of Dardania, said the government should support the prosecutor's office, courts and the police instead of establishing other institutions to deal with corruption.
The government decided last week to establish the task force, composed of eight Kosovo prosecutors and three from EULEX.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government has gone before the European Court, asking it to annul last year's decision by the European Commission (EC) to cut Romania's 2008-2012 carbon emissions quota, according to an announcement Friday (January 4th). 
This is the first such legal action by the country, which joined the EU a year ago, against a decision of the EU's executive arm. 
In October, the EC decided to cut Romania's annual carbon dioxide emission quota by 20.7% for 2008-2012. 
At the same time, the EC reduced by 10% Romania's emission level for 2007 compared to the national plan by Romanian authorities. 
This opens Romania up to lawsuits by local companies, which had set their emissions levels in compliance with the initial ceiling.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Leaders of the OMO Ilinden-Pirin group announced on Tuesday (February 20th) that Bulgaria's Supreme Cassation Court has rejected its appeal, upholding instead a ruling by Sofia's City Court that denied the group the right to formally register as a political party. 
OMO Ilinden-Pirin said its only option now is to file an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. 
OMO Ilinden-Pirin accuses the Bulgarian judiciary of discrimination and says the rulings indicate the courts are not yet independent. 
The government views the group as radical.

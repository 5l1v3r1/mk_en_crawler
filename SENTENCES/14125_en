BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The time has come for Kosovo status talks to begin, OSCE chairman-in-office Dimitrij Rupel said Friday (14 October), during visits to Belgrade and Pristina.
Rupel, who is also Slovenia's foreign minister, expressed OSCE's readiness to assist democratisation and development of Kosovo but said local interim institutions should also take responsibility for meeting internationally set standards.
The future solution to Kosovo's status should be conductive to the future stability of the region and Europe, Rupel said.
In other news, KFOR began a major three-day military exercise Friday to test interaction between national recovery and transportation units.
All four NATO-controlled sectors operating in Kosovo are taking part in the drill together with local and UN police.

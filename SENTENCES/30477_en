ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament passed a law Wednesday (December 15th) that allows property to be seized if it was acquired as a result of criminal activities.
Under the law, courts can freeze all assets of the accused before and during the criminal procedure.
It also obliges banks to provide information about the assets of people suspected of financial crimes.
The legislation was passed as part of government efforts to fight corruption and organised crime.

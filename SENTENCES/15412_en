SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin expressed scepticism Sunday (November 26th) that closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant 's two older units could take place any later than the December 2006 deadline envisioned in the country's EU Accession Treaty.
Last week, the European Parliament's external relations commission voted in favour of delaying the decommissioning deadline, citing concerns over energy supply stability in the Balkans.
But Kalfin told national radio on Sunday that there was no way Bulgaria's Accession Treaty could be adjusted now.
On Friday, a spokesman for EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs also ruled out the possibility of revising the terms of decommissioning.

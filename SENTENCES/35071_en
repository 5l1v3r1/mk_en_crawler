TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu reaffirmed that EU accession remains a national objective, during his address to an international forum in Switzerland on Friday (25 June).
"Albania sees in the success of the new EU members unavoidably its own future and this enlargement is an opportunity to benefit from the positive experience of the co-operation at the required levels," said Moisiu.
He also urged Brussels to increase support for the integration of the Western Balkans in the EU, particularly for technical assistance to narrow economic differences.

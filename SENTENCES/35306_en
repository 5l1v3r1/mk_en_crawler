SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The relatives of a dozen people missing since the 2001 military conflict walked out of a meeting Tuesday (17 February) with state leaders, including President Boris Trajkovski.
They were protesting the lack of new information in the cases.
The relatives were also disappointed that Democratic Union for Integration leader Ali Ahmeti did not attend.
They believe he knows what happened to the 12 Macedonian civilians who disappeared.
Seven ethnic Albanians and one Bulgarian national are also missing.
In other news, the UNDP on Tuesday launched a pilot programme aimed at boosting activities of local government and stimulating investment and job creation.
The municipalities of Stip and Kicevo are the first to experiment with the idea.

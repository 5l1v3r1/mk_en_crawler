BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu told Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Tuesday (February 12th) that he will not accept the proposed resignation of Teodor Melescanu as defence minister. 
Basescu is worried that the move would be badly timed, given the approaching NATO summit in April.
The ruling National Liberal Party (PNL) approved Melescanu's appointment as justice minister on Monday. 
Senator Radu Stroe was approved to replace Melescanu as defence minister. 
Melescanu is currently serving as both defence minister and interim justice minister.

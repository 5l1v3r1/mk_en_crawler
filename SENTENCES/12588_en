SOFIA, Bulgaria -- During a meeting with Bulgarian counterpart Solomon Passy on Tuesday (7 December), outgoing US Secretary of State Colin Powell praised Bulgaria's role in international politics.
Powell is in Sofia attending the annual OSCE ministerial summit.
Bulgaria is completing its term as chairman of the organisation.
In other news, Passy and Justice Minister Anton Stankov said on Monday that Bulgaria is considering a Libyan proposal to settle the case of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya on charges -- rejected by Bulgaria - of infecting 400 children with HIV.
Late last week, Tripoli indicated it might review the sentences if Bulgaria compensates the families of the children.

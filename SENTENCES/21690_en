NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities in Cyprus met on Friday (May 23rd) to discuss measures aiming at re-unifying the long-divided island. 
This was the first official meeting between Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias since they agreed in March to try to tackle the issue by establishing working groups to lay the groundwork for a re-unification agreement. 
Results from that effort were discussed at Friday's meeting, held at the official residence of the UN representative in Cyprus.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay on Friday (November 13th) revealed details of the government's long-awaited plan to give more rights to the Kurdish minority. 
The blueprint includes establishing an independent authority to investigate cases of alleged torture against Kurds, as well as measures to ease current restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language. 
The cabinet of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already taken measures to expand the cultural rights of the Kurdish community through the launch of a state television channel that broadcasts in Kurdish. 
In addition, Kurd-dominated towns and cities will be allowed to reclaim their former Kurdish names. 
The main opposition parties oppose the reforms, arguing they undermine national unity.

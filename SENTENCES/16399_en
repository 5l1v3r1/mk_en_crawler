TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Socialist Party (SP) held an extraordinary congress Saturday (10 June), during which delegates endorsed changes to the SP statute proposed by leader Edi Rama. 
Addressing participants, he said the adjustments were primarily aimed at democratising the party, as they would officially allow the existence of factions within SP and provide for an increased role of local party branches and of women in the decision-making process. 
All these changes, he added, are aimed at strengthening SP ahead of local elections in December or January. 
Local media reports suggest the congress revealed the continuing division between Rama and SP founder Fatos Nano, who was absent from the meeting.

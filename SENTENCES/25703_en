TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) decided on Tuesday (September 22nd) to ask political parties that failed to win seats in June's general election to give back money they were allocated for their campaigns. 
Six parties that were represented in the previous parliament will have to repay a total of 95,000 euros. 
The funds will be re-allocated to parties that won more seats or to those that are represented for the first time.

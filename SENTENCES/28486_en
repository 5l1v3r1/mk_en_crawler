ANKARA, Turkey -- Three Kurdish rebels were killed in clashes Thursday (October 14th) with Turkish security forces near the southeast Tunceli province.
The army launched an operation against members of the outlawed terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Wednesday after two soldiers and one Kurdish rebel were killed.
That clash erupted when rebels opened gunfire on troops who had urged them to surrender.
Security forces say the operation continues.
The fighting comes despite a unilateral ceasefire declared by the PKK in August and extended in late September for another month.

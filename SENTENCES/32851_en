ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said Sunday (2 February) that ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan would be nominated in the 9 March by-election in the province of Siirt.
Sahin said that as all legislative restrictions had been removed, there were no reasons why Erdogan should not run for parliament.
The High Election Board cancelled the previous results from the region because of reported election irregularities.
If elected to parliament, Erdogan is expected to head the Turkish government, while current Prime Minister Abdullah Gul will likely step down in favour of his party leader.

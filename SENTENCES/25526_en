BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (February 24th) decided to take Greece before the EU's Court of Justice for failing to recover state aid it had illegally granted to hundreds of companies through tax exemptions. 
"The recovery of illegal aid is about restoring a level playing field. 
The Commission is determined to take all necessary steps to ensure that member states comply with their recovery obligations," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
Under Greek law, companies were allowed to deduct up to 35% of their profits from their tax base in 2003 and 2004 if they had implemented projects in several specific sectors. 
They were to use these exemptions to pay for big ticket items, such as buildings and equipment, vehicles and relocation. 
But in 2007, the EC ruled Greece's move was illegal and incompatible with EU state aid rules, ordering Greece to immediately recover the grants. 
Greece, however, has not provided any such information to date.

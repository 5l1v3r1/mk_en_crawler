PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek urged politicians Monday (November 29th) not to make predictions or promises regarding visa liberalisation. 
She was responding to a statement by outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who said that Kosovo will see visa liberalisation with the EU within 15 months. 
Thaci also promised to make that happen if he receives a second mandate in next month's snap elections. 
Lunacek urged Thaci to specify the document that or official who has mentioned that date regarding visas and Kosovo. 
"I would request from the government still in power to wait for the mission that will come here next week and to see what has been implemented," she said in Pristina. 
She urged Kosovo authorities to work and prove that the conditions for visa removal are fulfilled.

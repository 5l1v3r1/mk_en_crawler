SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The European Commission remains dissatisfied with the pace of judicial reforms in Bulgaria, EU Home and Judicial Affairs Commissioner Jacques Barrot said on Tuesday (January 20th). 
He said the monitoring procedure will continue for an unspecified period, as there seems to be no major progress since the last report on judicial reforms a year ago. 
In Sofia, Barrot met with a number of senior officials, including Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and General Prosecutor Boris Velchev. 
Barrot emphasised the practice of writing action plans without implementing them must stop. 
He added that widespread corruption is a major deterrent to foreign investment.

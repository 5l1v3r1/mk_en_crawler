PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The mayor of Pristina Isa Mustafa is accusing the Kosovo Police of political blackmail and intimidation of municipal workers.
"Not even the UDB (Serbian Secret Service) acted like this in certain cases," Mustafa said during a press conference Thursday (April 28th).
Mustafa, who is also chairman of the main opposition Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), says the pressure is coming from police members close to the Democratic Party intelligence service SHIK.
Mustafa says SHIK members are infiltrating the police, the prosecution and the courts.
Recently, the Economic Crime Police Unit, through its investigators, filed charges against some municipal staff and former staff for abuse of office.

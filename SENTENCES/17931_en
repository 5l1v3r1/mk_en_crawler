PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The country's Constitutional Court rejected on Friday (December 15th) a request by the opposition to evaluate whether a law regulating the process of adopting a new Montenegrin Constitution complies with the current constitution. 
The opposition had approached the constitutional judges, claiming that the ruling majority violated procedures for proposing and adopting the law in Parliament. 
But the court concluded the matter fell outside its jurisdiction. 
A special parliamentary committee has been formed to draft a new constitution, now that Montenegro is independent.

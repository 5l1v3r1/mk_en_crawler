SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Sunday (April 19th) that constitutional changes in BiH are no condition for shutting down the office of the high representative or for the country's EU accession. 
In an interview with the Federation of BiH (FBiH) radio, Inzko said proving that constitutional changes are possible would be a good sign that "things can more forward". 
As amendments are negotiated, "the logic that some win, and some lose, should be abandoned," he added and stressed that the constitution should "make the state more efficient".

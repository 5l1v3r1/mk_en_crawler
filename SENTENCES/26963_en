TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Monday (January 4th) that his party is determined to continue its parliamentary boycott until the government agrees to investigate the June 2009 general elections.
Rama insists they were manipulated by the majority Democratic Party, despite the fact international institutions praised the elections process.
The SP has been boycotting parliament since September, hampering the EU accession process.

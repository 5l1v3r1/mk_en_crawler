BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Tuesday (April 17th) that he would resign "in five minutes", if Parliament votes to impeach him during a special session Thursday.
Basescu, who insists the opposition-led motion is purely political, reiterated that resigning would clear the way for snap elections, which he would win handily.
He noted that the Constitutional Court has rejected the reasons the main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) offers in seeking impeachment.
PSD says some of Basecu's actions have been unconstitutional.

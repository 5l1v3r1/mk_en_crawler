SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU Police Mission (EUPM) in BiH welcomed the enhanced role of the BiH police and its co-operation with SFOR in the ongoing disarmament campaign on Tuesday (10 August).
EUPM spokeswoman Kirsten Haupt said the fact that local police were initiating weapons collection efforts, such as those conducted in two Federation of BiH cantons, is encouraging.
Similar operations are expected in other parts of BiH this week, according to Haupt.
In other news, SFOR announced Monday the opening of an international training course at Camp Butmir for general inspectors of the BiH armed forces.
The week-long course is aimed at assisting defence reforms in BiH.

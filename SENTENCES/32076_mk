PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Some 22,000 teachers in Kosovo ended their two-week strike Tuesday (15 October), after being promised an average salary increase of 44 euros over the next four months. 
The average salary of a teacher in the Serbian province is about 150 euros, compared to 200 euros a month for other government employees. 
A committee of local and UN officials estimates that the wage increase will cost some five million euros this year alone. 
A UN spokesman said efforts are underway to find the money.
In other news, a 42-year-old Serb woman died Tuesday when she stepped on a landmine while working in a field near the village of Klokot. 
UN spokesman Andrea Angeli says the device was probably planted during the 1999 conflict.

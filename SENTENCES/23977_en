SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Security Agency launched an investigation on Monday (March 16th) of Ahmed Bashev, mayor of the village of Garmen, and Murat Bosnak, teacher of Islamic religion in the nearby village of Ribnovo. 
Both are suspected of spreading radical Islam and inciting religious hatred between Muslims and Christians. 
The two will also undergo questioning about several death threats against the independent lawmaker Yane Yanev, who recently warned that Islamic groups from Saudi Arabia were financing the construction of a mosque and religious education in Garmen. 
Around 3,000 people gathered in Ribnovo's central square Monday, claiming the accusations were absurd.

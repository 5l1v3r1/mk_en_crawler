ZAGREB, Croatia -- Economy Minister Djuro Popijac said on Wednesday (September 1st) the cabinet will wait for the European Commission's (EC) assessment of proposed restructuring programmes before deciding on privatisation bids for state-owned shipyards.
Only three of the six shipyards for sale attracted offers during the second privatisation tender, which ended on May 19th.
Privatising these shipyards is a key requirement in completing Croatia's EU accession talks.
Asked to comment on whether the government could turn to the IMF for financing, in light of the institution relaxing the terms of its lending tools, Popijac said the cabinet has not discussed it.

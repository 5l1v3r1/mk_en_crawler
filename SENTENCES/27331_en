ANKARA, Turkey -- Two days of demonstrations were held in cities across Turkey on Sunday (November 29th) and Monday to mark the 31st anniversary of the establishment of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Clashes were particularly serious in Mersin, where demonstrators attacked a police station, hurling stones and Molotov cocktails.
According to local media, violence erupted after an incident Sunday, in which a police officer seriously wounded a 16-year-old boy.
In Hakkari, around 30 people demonstrated on Monday, demanding better living conditions for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan who is serving a life sentence in prison.
Police used tear gas to disperse them.
In Siirt, 12 protesters were arrested, after police found they had no permit to demonstrate.
In the Sultanbeyli area of Istanbul, demonstrators torched a municipal bus late Sunday.
There were no injuries.

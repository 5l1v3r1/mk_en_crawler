BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serb Radical Party (SRS) Secretary-General Aleksandar Vucic criticised the state Sunday (March 4th) for failing to help defend SRS leader Vojislav Seselj, who awaits trial at the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. 
At a news conference, Vucic said Seselj's lawyers had trouble obtaining state documents related to the case, while tribunal prosecutors had access to all documents. 
The trial could begin in June or July, depending on Seselj's health, as he recovers from a hunger strike. 
He faces charges for the murder and persecution of non-Serbs during conflicts with Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s.

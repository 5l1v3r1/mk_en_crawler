BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Monday (11 August), the five-member Council of Ministers approved the participation of Serbia-Montenegro troops in UN operations.
"Serbia-Montenegro, as a UN member, fully supports peacekeeping missions in accordance with the UN Charter and this decision confirms the readiness of the Serbia-Montenegro soldiers to actively participate as peacekeepers in crisis regions under the UN flag," the council said in a statement.
The government hopes the decision would help in gaining admission into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
In other news, a defence ministry official reported that an army base in southern Serbia had come under mortar fire.
The incident, late Sunday in Dobrosin, caused no damage or casualties.

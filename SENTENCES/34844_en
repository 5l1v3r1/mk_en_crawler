BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- An estimated 70,000 refugees have returned from Serbia-Montenegro to their homes in Croatia since 1995, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Sunday (3 August).
The estimates suggest 200,000 other Croatian refugees remain in Serbia-Montenegro.
Croatia is rebuilding between 7,000 and 8,000 houses annually to resolve the problems of displaced persons.
UNHCR assessed the process of house reconstruction as relatively good but warned of problems with the distribution of property rights.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade Special Court spokeswoman Maja Kovacevic-Tomic announced on Wednesday (August 20th) that Vjerica Radeta and Petar Jojic, members of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), have visited Mihajlo "Legija" Ulemek in prison.
He is the convicted mastermind of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's 2003 assassination.
Kovacevic-Tomic said the court had approved the meeting as it pertained to the defence of SRS leader Vojislav Seselj in his trial at The Hague.
Ulemek, a former Special Operations Unit commander, received a 40-year prison sentence for Djindjic's murder and other crimes.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals chamber at the UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (October 13th) that the October 21st start of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's trial has been postponed.
But it is unclear for how long.
Karadzic, 64, submitted his request for postponement late last month, insisting he needs more time to prepare his defence.
Though the chamber complied with that, it rejected his appeal to drop the war crimes charges against him.
The judges instead upheld a July ruling that the trial proceed despite Karadzic's claim of immunity.
He is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from his alleged role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre which left 8,000 men and boys dead.
After more than ten years on the run, he was apprehended last year.

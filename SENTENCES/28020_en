PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Monday (May 17th) that he is "very happy" with the ongoing co-operation between the government and the EULEX mission.
Thaci met with EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon and the outgoing head of the mission's justice component, Alberto Perduca, who praised the government's commitment to judicial reforms and strengthening the rule of law.
Relations between the government and EULEX have been strained since recent raids on the home and office of one of Thaci's close aides, Minister of Transport and Telecommunications Fatmir Limaj, for suspected abuse of office.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH on Friday (October 16th) sentenced Bosnian Serb Milorad Trbic to 30 years in prison for genocide committed in Srebrenica in 1995.
Trbic was found guilty of killing dozens of people and involvement in the persecution and detention of thousands of Bosnian Muslims during the Srebrenica massacre.
The UN war crimes tribunal, which had charged Trbic with war crimes, crimes against the humanity and genocide, transferred the case to the BiH court in June 2007.

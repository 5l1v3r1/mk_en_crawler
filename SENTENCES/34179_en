OHRID, Macedonia -- The presidents of Albania, Bulgaria and Macedonia urged the EU on Friday (11 July) to help their countries build the transportation and communication link between Burgas and Durres, known as Transport Corridor 8.
Alfred Moisiu, Georgi Parvanov and Boris Trajkovski said the project is of utmost importance for the development of the region and would bring countries in it closer to EU membership.
The leaders also asked international financial organisations to invest in the construction of highways, railroads and telecommunications along the route that would link the Black Sea and the Adriatic.
Their trilateral meeting began in Bulgaria, moved to Macedonia and ends in Bulgaria on Sunday.

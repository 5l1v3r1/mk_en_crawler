BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic says he sees no obstacles preventing former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic's surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal.
Svilanovic acknowledged Sunday (12 January) talks are under way, but he was vague about the exact timing.
Svilanovic implied, however, that the surrender would happen soon.
Unofficial government sources have suggested it could occur as early as Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic said that talks are under way on a possible reshuffle of the Serbian cabinet.
Previously, he indicated the changes would involve shifting responsibilities, rather than new appointments.

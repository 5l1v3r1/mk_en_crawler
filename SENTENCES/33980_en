ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey announced plans on Monday (3 November) to streamline the government administration by transferring some services to the local authorities.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin told reporters that a law has been drafted which would give governors and mayors more power to handle local projects, such as construction of water systems and roads.
Currently, the government handles all such planning, including the appointment of junior local officials.
The bill also envisions the gradual reduction of the central government administration, reducing the number of ministers without portfolio from 20 to eight.
In other news, an explosion rocked the Turkish Embassy at The Hague on Tuesday, though no injuries were reported.
Bomb disposal teams were seen working on removing a second package left outside the building.

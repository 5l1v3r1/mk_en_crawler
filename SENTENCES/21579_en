ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court convened on Monday (July 28th) under heavy security to debate the closure case against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which faces charges of attempting to undermine the secular character of the state.
The court said it will debate daily until reaching a verdict, widely expected by early August.
The judges can find the AKP not guilty and dismiss the case or convict it and either fine or ban the party and some of its leaders, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul.
An AKP ban would mean early parliamentary elections, likely in November, according to local media reports.
In the second instalment of an interview with the daily Hurriyet on Sunday, Erdogan denied he would become a "tyrant" if his party escapes closure.
"I don't know what the result of the case will be ...
What I can tell you is that it is impossible for me to react with hate and animosity towards my people," he said.
Erdogan also denied claims that the operation against the shadowy secularist group Ergenekon was aimed at avenging the closure case.
A total of 86 people will go on trial in October for allegedly establishing an armed terrorist organisation seeking to topple the government.

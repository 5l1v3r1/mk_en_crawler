SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The ceremony opening the BiH Court's War Crimes Chamber and the Special War Crimes Department of the BiH Prosecutor's Office will be held in Sarajevo on Wednesday (9 March). 
UN war crimes tribunal President Theodor Meron, UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte and the international community's High Representative in BiH Paddy Ashdown, will attend and hold talks after the ceremony. 
The opening of the special units to process war crimes cases domestically has been described as a great step forward for the BiH judiciary and a recognition of the progress achieved in reforms. 
Starting in April, the UNDP and the Japanese government will provide extensive training of legal professionals and law enforcement officials within the new structure. 
A total of $500,000 will be extended from the Japan/UNDP Trust Fund for BiH for that purpose.

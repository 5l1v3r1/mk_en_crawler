NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police have arrested two of their own senior officers for suspected involvement in the escape last month of the country's most wanted criminal, Antonis Kitas, local media reported on Thursday (January 15th). 
Police detained Avraam Charalambous, deputy commander of the narcotics squad, and Giannos Giannako, a member of the squad. 
Kitas, known as "Al Capone", escaped from a private hospital in Nicosia on December 12th. 
He was serving a life sentence for the brutal 1994 rape and murder of two foreigners. 
Police recaptured him on January 4th. 
His escape prompted Justice Minister Kypros Chrysostomides to resign.

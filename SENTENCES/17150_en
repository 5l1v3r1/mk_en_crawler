SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling criticised the BiH Parliament on Thursday (31 August) for its slow work, noting lawmakers failed to adopt a single law from the set he described as important in a speech 100 days ago. 
Among them were measures regulating higher education, salaries, central banking supervision, and pharmaceuticals. 
Schwarz-Schilling conceded that the ongoing boycott by Republika Srpska (RS) lawmakers is one reason for the delay. 
The 1 October parliamentary elections are another distraction.
In other news Thursday, during a short trip to Belgrade, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik warned that independence for Kosovo might lead to more discontent in RS. 
He stressed that RS residents are closely watching developments on the status issue.

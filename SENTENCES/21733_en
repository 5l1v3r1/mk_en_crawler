BELGRADE, Serbia -- The coalition led by the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) should break off negotiations with the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the coalition between the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and New Serbia (NS), Dragan Markovic, leader of United Serbia (JS), said on Wednesday (May 21st).
The junior partner in the SPS-led coalition said negotiations on forming a ruling coalition should start with the Democratic Party (DS).
Markovic specifically criticised the DSS-NS for its desire to annul the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The SPS and its junior coalition partners, the JS and the Party of United Pensioners of Serbia, will discuss how to proceed on Thursday.
President Boris Tadic starts formal consultations of his own Thursday with all the parties that won seats in the May 11th elections.
He is holding them in his capacity as president, not as the leader of the DS.

ATHENS, Greece -- Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis said Sunday (16 May) that he was pleased with the results of a four-day exercise meant to test the country's ability to respond in the event of terrorist strikes during the Olympics in August. 
"We were given a chance to examine various scenarios and alternatives and evaluate the country's ability to offer a secure environment in Olympic venues," Voulgarakis said. 
Representatives of a seven-nation advisory panel monitored the drill. 
This was the eighth security exercise to date. 
Also Sunday, the public order ministry ruled out the possibility that armed foreign security personnel would accompany Olympic athletes. 
A spokesman insisted that Greek police are prepared to guard athletes both inside the Olympic venues and outside.

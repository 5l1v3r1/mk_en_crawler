BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor's office on Thursday (July 17th) called for the investigation of 28 Kosovo Albanians who once belonged to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
One of them -- Fatmir Limaj -- was acquitted by The Hague war crimes tribunal in 2005.
All 28 allegedly committed war crimes against 35 Serb and Albanian civilians in the Lipljan, Stimlje and Glogovac municipalities in central Kosovo between June and October 1998.
Prosecutors say all the victims, 22 of whom were later killed, suffered illegal imprisonment, though during Limaj's trial at The Hague these crimes went unmentioned.

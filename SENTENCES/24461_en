SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Electoral Bureau registered Plamen Galev, believed to be running an organised crime network in southwestern Bulgaria, as candidate in Kyustendil's single-seat constituency Wednesday (June 10th).
Earlier in the day, the prosecutor's office officially pressed charges against Galev and his partner, Angel Hristov, for racketeering, blackmail and assault.
However, electoral legislation doesn't bar those facing criminal charges from running in national elections.
If elected, he would automatically receive immunity from prosecution, forcing a cumbersome process aimed at lifting that immunity.

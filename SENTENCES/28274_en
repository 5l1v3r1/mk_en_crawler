PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government is drafting a joint strategy with countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence regarding actions Pristina should undertake after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules later this year on the legality of the 2008 independence declaration.
"We expect, together with our international friends, to be more active in representing Kosovo, the image of Kosovo and to lobby for recognition," Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Sunday (April 18th).
Kuci added that the ICJ opinion will end the hesitation felt by countries that have not recognised Kosovo.

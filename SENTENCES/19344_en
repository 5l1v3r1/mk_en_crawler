TIRANA, Albania -- Analysing last year's performance of district courts in Vlora, Fier, Berat and Lushnja, Justice Minister Enkeled Alibeaj accused Albanian judges on Monday (February 25th) of corruption and of allowing political ties to influence their work. 
Alibeaj urged all members of the judicial system to distance themselves from corruption, saying it has taken on the scale of an infectious disease.
For his part, the vice chairman of the High Judicial Council, Kreshnik Spahiu, said all incompetent judges would be removed from their posts for the system to start functioning correctly. 
The judges blame a massive administrative workload.

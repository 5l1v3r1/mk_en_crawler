ANKARA, Turkey -- About 3,000 people gathered in downtown Diyarbakir on Monday (February 15th) to mark the 10th anniversary of the arrest of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
The demonstrators tried to march down one of the main streets but were blocked by police, sparking clashes. 
Security personnel fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. 
Around 30 protestors were arrested. 
Most shops in Diyarbakir closed in support of the Kurdish cause. 
In Istanbul, around 500 people marched in support of the PKK. 
Police again used tear gas to disperse them.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu called on Albanian diplomats Tuesday (31 August) to focus on developing economic ties with other countries.
He said that while some progress had been made in this direction, the country must take more effective steps to boost economic co-operation and attract foreign capital.
Moisiu added that this is essential for a small, developing country like Albania.

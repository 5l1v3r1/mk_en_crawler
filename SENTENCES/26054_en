BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday (November 16th) that EU members should help settle disputes between Greece and Turkey that hamper a deal for improving security situation in Afghanistan. 
NATO member Turkey is vetoing formal relations between the Alliance and the EU, which prevents NATO from providing protection for EU trainers deployed in Afghanistan. 
Furthermore, Ankara does not recognise the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia, although Cyprus is an EU member. 
Speaking at a joint meeting of all EU defence and foreign ministers in Brussels, Rasmussen stressed that improving relations between NATO and the EU is a priority for him.

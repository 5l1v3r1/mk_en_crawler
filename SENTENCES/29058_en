ATHENS, Greece -- The ruling PASOK party is leading in the regions of Greater Athens, Western Greece, Central Greece, Eastern Macedonia, Crete and the Southern Aegean, according to partial results of Sunday's (November 7th) local elections.
The results helped the government of Prime Minister George Papandreou avoid snap elections -- an option Papandreou had hinted of in case of a loss.
"We know that change is not easy.
But it was for this change that the Greek people brought us to power a year ago.
And today it again confirmed that it wants this change," Papandreou said in a televised statement Sunday.
The main opposition New Democracy is ahead in Central Macedonia, Western Macedonia, the Northern Aegean, Epirus, Thessaly and the Ionian Islands, according to the partial results.
The two parties are close in the Peloponnese region.
Turnout among the 10 million people legally required to vote was around 60%.
Any run-offs will be held on November 14th.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A group calling itself the Albanian National Army (ANA) issued an ultimatum on Monday (1 September), giving Macedonian security forces 24 hours to withdraw from the Kumanovo-Lipkovo region or face attack.
Earlier Monday, security forces strengthened their presence in the area, in an attempt to catch an ANA commander believed responsible for last week's brief kidnapping of two Macedonian policemen.
On Tuesday, OSCE representatives and ethnic Albanian parliamentarians are due to talk to ANA members about the ultimatum.

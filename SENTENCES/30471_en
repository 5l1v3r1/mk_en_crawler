ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu criticised US Ambassador Francis Ricciardone on Thursday (February 17th) for his remarks about media freedoms in Turkey, following the recent detention of journalists.
"It is not right for an ambassador to make judgements over an ongoing criminal investigation," Davutoglu told journalists in Nepal, where he is visiting.
Ricciardone made the comment Tuesday when asked by reporters about a raid on Oda TV a day earlier.
Police searched the office of the online news portal over suspected links to a terror network accused in the so-called Ergenekon plot to create chaos and topple the government.
The media's owner, Soner Yalcin, and three of his colleagues were detained for questioning.
One was later released.
"On the one hand there exists a stated policy supporting a free press.
On the other hand, journalists are put under detention.
We are trying to make sense of this," Ricciardone, said without mentioning a particular case.

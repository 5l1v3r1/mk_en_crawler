ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country may face the first obstacle on its road to EU accession due to its dispute with Italy and Slovenia over the use of territorial waters in the Adriatic, the AFP reported on Wednesday (October 10th), citing EU sources. 
The EU is expected to open two new chapters -- on foreign affairs and health -- in accession negotiations with Croatia on Friday. 
But the foreign affairs chapter reportedly may be blocked by Slovenia and Italy, which are angry over Croatia's plans to limit access to its fishing zones in the Adriatic Sea. 
Croatia established an ecological zone in 2004, to restrict fishing in the Adriatic.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country takes up the EU's rotating presidency in January, acknowledged on Wednesday that Ljubljana has reservations about opening Croatia's external policy chapter, in light of the fishing ban.

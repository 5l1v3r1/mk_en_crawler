BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic has asked the commission investigating the truth about events in Srebrenica to submit its report by Wednesday (14 April).
The cabinet would then decide whether the commission complied with the requirements of the BiH Human Rights' Chamber.
An earlier report downplaying the magnitude of the 1995 massacre sparked international condemnation.

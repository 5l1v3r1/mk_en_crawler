TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Monday (December 29th) amended the new election code after President Bamir Topi refused to ratify the original bill. 
Lawmakers voted 116-3 to remove a clause calling for the president to decree national elections nine months in advance. 
Earlier in December, Topi sent the bill back to parliament, arguing it would be impossible to meet the deadline and hold parliamentary elections in late June as scheduled.
In other new Monday, Albania's Foreign Ministry condemned last week's arrest of ten former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army for alleged war crimes in the Serbian town of Presevo in 1991, calling the move ethnically motivated. 
The ministry demanded international monitoring of the human rights situation in Presevo Valley after the arrests.

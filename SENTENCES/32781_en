BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Constitutional Court Chairman Slobodan Vucetic asserted Monday (9 December) that a broader reading of the constitution would allow Serbian Parliament Speaker Natasa Micic to assume the presidency of the republic, following the latest failed election. 
He quoted an article from the constitution which stipulates that "if for any reason the president of the republic should be temporarily prevented from performing his duties, he will be replaced by the parliament speaker." Interpretation of the article is significant because the constitution does not foresee a situation in which the term of the incumbent president expires before a new one is elected. 
On Monday, the head of the OSCE monitoring mission in Belgrade, Nikolai Vulchanov, warned that the inability to elect a new president is damaging Belgrade's credibility.

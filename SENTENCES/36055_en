NEW YORK, United States -- Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul met with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Wednesday (24 March). 
Afterwards, Zuzul said Annan had praised Croatia's progress in several fields over the past three months, including co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In other news, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader reiterated that the government intends to continue implementing a programme on refugee returns and property restitution. 
The largest Serb party in Croatia is threatening to stop co-operating with the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, saying implementation has been too slow. 
Croatian television is to begin broadcasting an OSCE-sponsored series of programmes on the return of Serb refugees.

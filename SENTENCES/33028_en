ANKARA, Turkey -- A reform package aimed at harmonising Turkish law with that of the EU was submitted to the government on Thursday (22 May).
The 19-article package envisions amendments to ten laws, including a controversial article in the anti-terror law.
It also allows for the presence of foreign observers during elections and provides for broadcasting in minority languages by private television channels.
A proposal for allowing pre-election campaigns in minority languages was dropped from the final version submitted to the government.

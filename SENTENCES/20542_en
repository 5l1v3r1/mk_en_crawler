PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament announced a month-long competition Tuesday (March 11th) to choose an anthem for the newly independent nation.
"It should follow the criteria set by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's comprehensive status proposal, meaning it will have to respect all communities living in Kosovo," Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said.
The anthem should be no longer than 60 seconds and sound different than that of any other country, Krasniqi added.
Parliament has already approved a flag and a coat of arms.

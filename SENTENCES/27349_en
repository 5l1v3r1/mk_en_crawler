PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Integrations Minister Besim Beqaj is optimistic that Kosovo will be offered a roadmap leading to eventual visa-free travel with the EU. 
"I have received confirmation that an official dialogue will start soon and we will get the questionnaire," Beqaj was quoted by media as saying on Sunday (May 30th). 
In addition to technical requirements, Kosovo faces a distinct difficulty other applicants don't, as five EU countries have not recognised its statehood.

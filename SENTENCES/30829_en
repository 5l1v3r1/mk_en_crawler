BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) will submit an initiative to amend the constitution Thursday (January 13th), aimed at cutting the number of lawmakers from the current 250 to 125, SNS Vice-President Aleksandar Vucic said on Sunday.
The party launched a petition seeking support for its initiative and has managed to collect more than 280,000 signatures.
The SNS plans an anti-government rally early next month and insists on talks with the ruling coalition about calling early parliamentary elections.

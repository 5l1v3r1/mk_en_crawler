TIRANA, Albania -- The government approved on Wednesday (July 29th) an action plan for EU integration that will be sent to the European Commission (EC), which will be evaluating Albania's progress. 
Calling EU integration a top priority, Prime Minister Sali Berisha reiterated that progress is largely on track. 
"We are doing well in the issuance of biometric passports, but there are some other aspects we are working on as well," said Berisha, adding that a team of EC experts is expected to visit in October. 
Albania must still establish a coast guard for its maritime border, and craft measures to confiscate the assets of organised crime members.

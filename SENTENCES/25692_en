PRISTINA, Kosovo â€“ The coalition government, composed of the two biggest parties--President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK)--faces collapse, local media reported on Thursday (November 19th), citing sources close to the cabinet. 
The problem appears to be a local-level coalition agreement the LDK struck with the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) ahead of the December 13th second round of local elections. 
The same sources said that the PDK is expected to decide Friday to form a coalition with two opposition parties--The New Kosovo Alliance and The Democratic League of Dardania. 
Tensions between the LDK and the PDK started during the election campaign, when statements against each other prompted talk of a split.
However, Thaci's party said on Friday that there will be no shift in the coalition with the LDK at the central level. 
"The central coalition partnership remains consolidated, functional and pristine, the party said in a statement.
In other news, satisfaction with the work of Kosovo institutions is declining, according to a report by the UN Development Programme office in Kosovo. 
The "Early Warning Report" finds people are increasingly unhappy with parliament, UNMIK and EULEX. 
In contrast, the performance of KFOR and the Kosovo police is gaining approval.

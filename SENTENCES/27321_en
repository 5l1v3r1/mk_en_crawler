ZAGREB, Croatia -- The anti-corruption office, USKOK, has charged Neven Jurica, former head of the Croatian mission to the UN, with abuse of power and embezzlement of at least 79,000 euros. 
The charges Monday (November 30th) followed an investigation that spanned nearly five months. 
It is alleged that between 2007 and 2008, Jurica used state money for private expenses. 
In April of this year, he asked to be relieved of his duties, citing health issues. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration tightened control over the UN mission's spending in late June after uncovering the irregularities.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Aleksandar Simic, an adviser to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, predicted on Thursday (25 November) that Belgrade would soon change its attitude towards war-crimes co-operation.
"We are aware that because of more important interests, we have to work harder on a different plan and work more decisively.
In this case, I expect that our politics towards The Hague will see some changes." The statement followed criticism by US Special Envoy for War Crimes Issues Pierre Richard Prosper, who said Belgrade has done little to meet its obligations.
Prosper said "a serious talk" should be held with Kostunica, as he is key to resolving the issue.

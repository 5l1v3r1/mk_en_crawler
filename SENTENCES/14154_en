SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The 4th anniversary of the Ohrid Peace Accords, that granted broader rights to Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community and put an end to the interethnic conflict in Macedonia in 2001, was marked in the country Friday (12 August). 
President Branko Crvenkovski -- who was one of the four signatories of the agreement -- said that signing a political deal instead of seeking a military solution to the security crisis was the right choice. 
Crvenkovski said that the fact that Macedonia is now a stable country is the best proof of this. 
"The road from Skopje to Brussels passes via Ohrid," Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said, praising the accords. 
He said that the implementation of the peace framework agreement was a major prerequisite to Macedonia's integration in the EU and NATO.

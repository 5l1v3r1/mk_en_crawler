BELGRADE, Serbia -- Opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) leader Tomislav Nikolic said on Thursday (February 3rd) that the demonstration planned by his party for Saturday will be peaceful.
The rally, which is planned to be held in front of the parliament building in Belgrade, is expected to draw thousands of people from all over Serbia.
Nikolic wants the government to call early elections within two months and says the SNS will organise mass rallies and blockades of the capital if its demands aren't met.

TIRANA, Albania -- Newly appointed Health Minister Anila Godo promised on Wednesday (July 30th) to reform the country's troubled healthcare sector.
"There will be changes, and I assure you there won't be any political prejudice but only a professional approach," Godo said while taking over her official duties.
She said the system's main concerns are poor financing and a rising demand for medical services.
At a cabinet meeting Wednesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha described the healthcare system as the country's most corrupt.
In other news, law enforcement officials raided the southern village of Lazarat early Thursday and seized about 5,000 cannabis plants, according to media reports.
Residents of the village have cultivated drug plants for years, leading to many incidents with police.

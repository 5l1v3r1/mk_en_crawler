SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament's panel for election issues and appointments approved a draft law Tuesday (11 April) on the composition of the State Election Commission (SEC), sending it on for adoption by the full legislature later this week. 
Under the proposal, Jovan Josifovski will be appointed SEC chairman. 
Deputy Justice Minister Suphi Jakupi will be SEC deputy chairman, while Aleksander Novakovski, Tanja Altandjieva, Xhemali Saiti, Snezana Kaleska and Aleksandar Dastevski will be SEC members.
In other news, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski visited Luxembourg on Tuesday and assured counterpart Jean-Claude Juncker that Skopje is committed to organising fair and democratic elections later this year. 
That is a condition for Macedonia's integration into the EU and NATO.
Also Tuesday, the government adopted a set of draft laws aimed at restructuring the judicial sector. 
The changes envision, among other things, introducing specialised courts for separate processing of civil and criminal cases, establishing special court units for serious crimes, and strengthening judges' professional qualifications.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The international troika that has mediated negotiations on Kosovo's final status -- the EU's Wolfgang Ischinger, Russia's Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko and the US's Frank Wisner -- travel to Belgrade and Pristina on Monday (December 3rd) to brief both sides on the report they are going to give UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon next week.
The document goes first to the Kosovo Contact Group in Vienna on December 9th, ten days before the UN Security Council is expected to start debating the issue.
The report is expected to acknowledge no compromise between Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians.
Meanwhile, the International Herald Tribune says the EU is drafting a plan for Kosovo.
It includes setting up am EU administration to replace UNMIK, implementing former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence, and convincing Kosovo's leadership to put off a unilateral declaration of independence.
An unnamed EU diplomat told the paper that Brussels wants more time to persuade Russia to drop its opposition to Kosovo's independence and support the project.

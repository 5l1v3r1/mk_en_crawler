TIRANA, Albania -- Greek President Karolos Papoulias canceled a meeting with Albanian counterpart Alfred Moisiu and returned home on Tuesday (1 November) amid a minority group's anti-Greek protests. 
The two leaders had been due to meet in the town of Saranda, opposite the Greek island of Corfu. 
However, some 200 members of the Albanian Muslim Cham clan staged a demonstration at the venue site, prompting Papoulias's departure. 
The protestors, saying they represented Chams expelled from Greece after World War II, were claiming compensation for lost property and the right to return to Greece.
Calling the protesters "known extreme elements" agitating over "non-existent issues", the Greek government accused Albanian authorities of failing to take adequate measures to prevent the demonstrations. 
An Albanian presidential spokesman, however, lamented Greece's "hasty and unexplained decision" in the face of a peaceful protest.

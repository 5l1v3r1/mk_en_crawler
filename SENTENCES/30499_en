ATHENS, Greece -- A general strike organised by local labour unions Wednesday (December 15th) sparked violent clashes between demonstrators and the police. 
Rampaging protestors hurled Molotov cocktails at two luxury hotels in downtown Athens, torched a post office near the finance ministry and damaged dozens of cars. 
Police responded with tear gas and stun grenades. 
A group of about 200 protestors lobbed rocks at former Transport and Communications Minister Costis Hatzidakis while he was leaving the parliament building, injuring him seriously. 
Police announced dozens of arrests, and at least five injuries among the group of protesters, estimated at between 15,000 and 20,000. 
This seventh general strike since the start of the year paralysed public transportation, closed schools, factories and many hospitals and grounded flights. 
New strikes in the public and private sector are planned for Thursday and Friday
In other news, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement on Wednesday that the bloc is sending 9.8m euros and two teams of experts to help Greece deal with a rising tide of asylum seekers. 
The fresh aid comes weeks after the EU sent a team of 175 border control specialists to the Orestiada area. 
The Union decided in October to send the teams, following a request from Athens.

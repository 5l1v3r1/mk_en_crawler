THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal turned down a request by the prosecution for the appointment of legal counsel to help Slobodan Milosevic in his defence on Wednesday (9 April).
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte filed a motion in November arguing that the pressure of defending himself has taken a toll on the former Yugoslav president's health and delayed the trial.
In other news, Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said on Wednesday that several people have been arrested in connection with the massacre of more than 200 people during the 1991 siege of Vukovar.
He did not provide any other details but said the arrests were made during the clampdown that followed the assassination of late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
The UN tribunal has indicted three men in connection with the massacre.

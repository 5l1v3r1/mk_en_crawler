BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) proposed on Monday (12 September) the extension of current trade preferences for the Western Balkan states -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro including Kosovo -- until 2010. 
The proposal, which must be forwarded to the EU Council, is aimed at boosting economic development and political stability in the region. 
The statement noted that the preferences, which have been in place for five years, granted these countries duty-free access to virtually all goods, as well as privileged access to the EU market.

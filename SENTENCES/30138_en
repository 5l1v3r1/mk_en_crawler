BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Victor Ponta on Tuesday (March 22nd) urged fellow party member Adrian Severin to resign after he was implicated in a bribery scandal. 
Severin and two other European Parliament (EP) members -- Slovenia's Zoran Thaler and Austria's Ernst Strasser -- were the targets of an expose by reporters from the British daily Sunday Times, who pretended to be lobbyists. 
The three allegedly agreed to accept thousands of euros in exchange for tabling various amendments to EU legislation. 
Thaler and Strasser have stepped down. 
Severin says he will withdraw from the Socialist group but will remain in the EP. 
Ponta said on Tuesday Severin will be fired if he fails to resign both from the party and his EP post.

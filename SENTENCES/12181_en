NEW YORK, United States -- Bulgarian-born artist Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude transformed New York's Central Park into an art exhibit with the opening of their "The Gates" project on Saturday (12 February). 
Christo, who has wrapped the German Reichstag and other buildings and bridges, installed 7,500 four-metre-tall gates along nearly 40km of walkways. 
Each gate bears a banner made of bright orange fabric. 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a long-time supporter of the project, unfurled the first five banners of what was described as New York's "river of colours". 
The gates will remain in place for 16 days.

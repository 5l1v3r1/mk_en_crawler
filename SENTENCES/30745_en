SOFIA, Bulgaria -- State power utility NEK and Atomstroyexport, the contractor selected for the Belene nuclear power plant and subsidiary of Rosatom, agreed on Tuesday (April 5th) to delay the project by three months to allow more time to discuss safety, in the wake of Japan's disaster. 
They will have until the end of June to look into pending issues, such as additional safety nets and the project's cost. 
The Bulgarian government will also be receiving the financial viability report from consultant HSBC.
Separately Tuesday, NEK's director Krasimir Parvanov was fired over the deal he signed with Rosatom. 
Economy Minister Traycho Traykov says the memorandum of understanding was "unfavourable to Bulgaria".

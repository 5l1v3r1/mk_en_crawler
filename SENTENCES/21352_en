PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Marking the International Day of the Right to Know on Saturday (September 27th), the Association of Kosovo Professional Journalists insisted that Kosovo institutions lack transparency.
During a debate in Pristina, journalists complained that current institutions are identical to those of previous governments.
The best indicator, argued the journalists, is the continued lack of a government spokesperson.
In other news, EU special representative to Kosovo Pieter Feith told Voice of America on Sunday that while every UN member has the right to demand an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding Kosovo's independence, "it cannot have an impact ...
because it is an irreversible process." Serbia wants to ask the ICJ's opinion on the legality of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Incumbent President Tassos Papadopoulos said on Tuesday (February 19th) that he will not support either of the two candidates competing for his job in Sunday's run-off. 
Papadopoulos lost to conservative Ioannis Kassoulides and communist leader Demetris Christofias in the first round last Sunday. 
"I will not interfere either directly or indirectly in the second round of the vote," said Papadopoulos, whose mandate expires on February 29th.

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- The interim Governing Council of Iraq reiterated its opposition to plans for the deployment of Turkish troops to Iraq on Saturday (11 October).
Governing Council member Mahmud Othman said the Iraqi officials were holding talks on the issue with US military representatives.
He added that the governing council viewed the proposed step as an unnecessary one, and that Turkey could help Iraq in other ways.
The Turkish Parliament approved the deployment of troops to Iraq earlier in the week, and the government was given a mandate to determine the details of the mission with US officials.

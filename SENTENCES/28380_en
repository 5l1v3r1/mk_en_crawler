BELGRADE, Serbia -- Authorities in Italy, Montenegro, Slovenia and Serbia arrested 80 people Tuesday (November 16th) linked to alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric's crime group. 
Serbian organised crime prosecutor Miljko Radisavljevic described those rounded up as "members of an international criminal group suspected to have planned, organised and distributed cocaine for the Italian market". 
Montenegrin police detained Saric's brother -- Dusko Saric, and two Serbian citizens based on an arrest warrant issued by Italy for drug dealing. 
Darko Saric, who is wanted by Serbia, and his group are suspected of smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America. 
Italy has also issued an arrest warrant for him.

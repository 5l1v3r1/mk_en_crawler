TIRANA, Albania -- The small parliamentary parties in Albania oppose changes to the election law agreed upon by the two main political parties -- the ruling Socialists and opposition Democrats.
On Thursday (6 January), deputies representing the Socialist Movement for Integration and the Legality Movement Party criticised the changes.
But a third small party, the Republican Party, backs the draft law, which is to be debated Monday.
In other news Thursday, the union representing elementary and secondary school teachers decided to call another strike, this one on 17 January.
They are demanding better wages and say the government has had along enough to consider the matter.

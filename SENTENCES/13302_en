VIENNA, Austria -- Delegations from Belgrade and Pristina kicked off direct negotiations Monday (20 February) on what a UN spokeswoman described as a "constructive" note.
The talks are focusing on self-government issues and the demands by Serbs for greater freedom to run the areas where they are a majority.
According to media reports, Belgrade is calling for immediate implementation of decentralisation reforms, while Pristina is reluctant to start the process.
Negotiations resumed on Tuesday.

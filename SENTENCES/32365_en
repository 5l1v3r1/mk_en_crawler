BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said Saturday (29 March) that the law on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal would likely be amended to facilitate the extradition of suspects.
The new central parliament is expected to meet in coming weeks to review Article 39, which prevents the extradition of anyone officially indicted after the adoption of the original act in April 2002.
Zivkovic said President Svetozar Marovic supports the proposed amendments.
Also Saturday, Zivkovic claimed success in the fight against organised crime.
Crediting the state of emergency imposed earlier this month after the assassination of Zoran Djindjic, Zivkovic told B92 radio that, after a few more arrests, "we would be able to say that organised crime in Serbia has been defeated."
In other news, police in Serbia are looking for Mira Markovic, the wife of Slobodan Milosevic, in connection with her suspected role in the 2000 abduction and murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic.
His remains were recovered from a pit last week.
Officials believe Markovic may be hiding in Russia.
They vowed to issue an international arrest warrant for her if she refuses to return.

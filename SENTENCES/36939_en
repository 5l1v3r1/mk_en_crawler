TIRANA, Albania -- Albania and Italy acknowledged the efforts both countries are making to boost co-operation in fighting crime. 
Meeting with Italian chief anti-mafia prosecutor Pierluigi Vigna and deputy prosecutor Francesco Mandoi on Wednesday (30 June), Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Italy has played a key role in helping Albania step up the fight against crime. 
In turn, the Italians hailed the countries' joint efforts as well as Albania's individual efforts, such as drafting laws against organised crime.

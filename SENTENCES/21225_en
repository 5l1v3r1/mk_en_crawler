SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Efficient talks are under way between Skopje and Athens regarding Macedonia's name dispute, but differences remain, UN envoy in the conflict Matthew Nimetz said on Friday (June 27th), after meetings with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and President Branko Crvenkovski in Skopje. 
Nimetz said the ideas he conveyed to local officials did not come in the form of concrete proposals, adding talks to settle the issue continue. 
Nimetz was in Athens on Thursday where he met with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Greece's representative in the talks, Adamantios Vassilakis.

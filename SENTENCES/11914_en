TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Party (SP) Organisational Secretary Petro Koci and Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Skender Gjinushi lashed out Wednesday (13 July) at three former SP allies that appear likely to join a coalition with the Democratic Party (DP), which won the 3 July parliamentary elections. 
The two officials said that the Party for Social Democracy, the Agrarian Environmentalist Party and the Union for Human Rights Party -- all firmly from the left of the political spectrum but planning to move to the right -- are engaged in "vote trafficking".
In other news Wednesday, UNMIK and Albanian police agreed to jointly investigate the disappearance of Behar Kastrati, chairman of the DP branch in Has. 
He went missing on 7 July.

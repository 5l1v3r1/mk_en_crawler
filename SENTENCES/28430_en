SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives on Wednesday (June 16th) gave a first reading approval to the draft law on conducting a population census next year. 
According to the bill, Bosnian citizens may -- but are not obliged to -- declare their ethnic and religious background, or their language. 
It also stipulates that the Diaspora will be covered by a separate census. 
Various political parties agreed to hold the census in 2011, but have been arguing over the content of the questionnaire. 
Bosniaks and Croats have opposed certain questions on ethnicity, given the number of people who fled the country during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Separately Wednesday, members of the European Parliament (EP) voiced support for offering visa-free travel to Bosnians. 
They debated the issue ahead of Thursday's vote on a report by EP member Doris Pack. 
The report is largely critical of the situation in BiH, 15 years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement.

ATHENS, Greece -- Three opinion polls suggest that the gap between the ruling party, PASOK, and the main opposition New Democracy (ND) is narrowing.
The polls, conducted by Metron Analysis, Opinion and Rass respectively, and published in three Athenian papers, put ND within the 37.9 - 39.3 per cent approval range, compared to between 30.2 and 32.2 per cent for PASOK.
That represents slippage for ND over the past few months.
When asked who would make a better prime minister, respondents gave PASOK leader Costas Simitis a comfortable lead over his ND counterpart, Costas Karamanlis.

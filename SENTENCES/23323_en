BRUSSELS, Belgium --EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn meets on Wednesday (May27th) with Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar and his Croatian counterpart, Gordan Jandrokovic, Rehn's spokesperson Krisztina Nagy said.
This will be their first meeting since Slovenia and Croatia responded to Rehn's proposal for resolving their long-standing border dispute.
His plan envisions establishment of an ad hoc five-member international arbitration tribunal on the issue.
Croatia accepted the offer but Slovenia submitted some amendments to it.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Monday that Zagreb would accept none of the Slovenian changes.
But the Slovenian Foreign Ministry insists Ljubljana's amendments would make it "more balanced" and would "also reflect the interests of the Slovenian side".

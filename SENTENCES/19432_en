PODGORICA, Montenegro -- NATO and Montenegro struck a deal Monday (November 26th) to allow the transit of Alliance troops through the land, sea and air territory of the small Adriatic country.
The document was signed in Podgorica by Defence Minister Boro Vucinic and visiting deputy commander of Allied Joint Force Command in Naples, Lieutenant General Peter Pearson.
Montenegro joined NATO's Partnership for Peace programme in November 2006, the first step to potential accession.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski welcomed on Sunday (April 18th) statements by Ali Ahmeti -- leader of junior coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) -- that his party will remain in the coalition, even if the name dispute with Greece is not resolved by June.
During a visit to Tetovo's flooded Raotince village, Gruevski insisted that problems can be resolved through dialogue.
Ahmeti said his party decided to remain in the ruling coalition because leaving would be harmful to the country.
Ahmeti stressed that DUI is working with its partners to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name row, the main obstacle to Macedonia's NATO accession and EU bid.

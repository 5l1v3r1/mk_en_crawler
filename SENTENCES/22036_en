BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic, who leads the Democratic Party (DS), proposed the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) to form a responsible government with his party, according to a statement Friday (May 16th). 
It confirmed that Tadic held informal talks with SPS and that Tadic described as acceptable a coalition government that would continue the EU integration process, defend Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure economic development and social justice. 
SPS leader Ivica Dacic denied any negotiations with DS were held.
Also Friday, Vojislav Kostunica, Serbia's outgoing prime minister and leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), denied accusations by DS that he was ignoring the wishes of the public by trying to form a coalition government with the Serbian Radical Party and SPS. 
Talks among several parties began following inconclusive parliamentary elections a week ago.

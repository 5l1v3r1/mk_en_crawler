SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Monday (November 3rd) the EU should refocus its attention on BiH to address the damage irresponsible rhetoric by politicians in both entities has done to the country's postwar recovery and its EU integration prospects.
Lajcak met with British Minister for Europe Caroline Flint in London, briefing her on the progress made in implementing five objectives and two conditions set by the Peace Implementation Council's Steering Board in February.
He pointed out that local parties have failed to agree on two key conditions:
the fair and orderly allocation of state property and resolution of Brcko's constitutional status.
In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Lajcak reiterated the EU should take decisive steps to prevent instability in BiH.
In other news, over 12,000 employees of state institutions in BiH staged a strike Monday, demanding higher pay and better working conditions.
Protesters included staff at several institutions, including the defence ministry and the Bosnian State Agency for Investigation and Protection (SIPA).
Also Monday, Croatian Democratic Union 1990 (HDZ-1990) leader Bozo Ljubic confirmed that he plans to step down as transport and communication minister.
Ljubic said there are both personal and political reasons for his move but did not elaborate.

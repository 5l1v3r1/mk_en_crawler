BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government marked its first 100 days in office Tuesday (October 14th) with a news conference by Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic. 
His list of biggest accomplishments included the ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, the signing of a gas deal with Russia and acquisition of funds for the construction of Corridor 10, as well as Belgrade's recent success in bringing the issue of Kosovo's independence before the International Court of Justice. 
Cvetkovic acknowledged, however, that the first 100 days served mostly to "consolidate work" and shore up relations within the ruling coalition. 
He promised the real results still lie ahead. 
The opposition painted a very different picture, giving the government a 1.5 on a scale of 20 points.

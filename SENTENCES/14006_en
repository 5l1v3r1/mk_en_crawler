WASHINGTON, United States -- US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns, meeting in Washington late last week with Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci, called on Kosovo authorities to do more to protect minority rights in the province, a State Department press release said. 
He also reaffirmed US support for the UN-run negotiations on Kosovo's final status.
On Monday (16 January), the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo held a closed-door session in Vienna to discuss further steps to be taken in determining the province's status. 
UN Special Envoy for Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari attended the session. 
Delegations from Belgrade and Pristina are expected to meet in Vienna on 25 January to discuss decentralisation issues.

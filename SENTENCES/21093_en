NEW YORK, United States -- At a meeting in New York on Thursday (November 1st), the UN mediator for the Greece-Macedonia name dispute submitted to the UN ambassadors of the two countries, Adamantios Vassilakis of Greece and Nikola Dimitrov of Macedonia, a number of suggestions aimed at ending the 16-year long row. 
Envoy Matthew Nimetz said the proposals are "in the form of a draft framework for their consideration as the basis for an honourable and fair solution". 
He urged both sides to consider all possibilities so that a solution could be reached within a reasonable timeframe. 
Diplomatic sources say the document does not contain a specific name proposal or deadlines. 
Greek authorities are threatening to block Macedonia's EU and NATO accession unless the dispute is resolved.

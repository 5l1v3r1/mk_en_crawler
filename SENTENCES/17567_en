BELGRADE, Serbia -- The UN Security Council will hold its first session on Kosovo's future on Tuesday (April 3rd), British Ambassador to Serbia Steven Wordsworth announced on Thursday. 
He added that at the moment, special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan is being translated and delivered to delegations in New York.
On Friday EU foreign ministers began an informal meeting in Bremen, Germany to discuss the goal of supervised independence for Kosovo. 
The ministers are studying a new report by EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on plans for a massive EU civilian mission in Kosovo. 
Leaked portions suggest Solana and Rehn have warned that Kosovo could be hit by violence as it moves towards independence.

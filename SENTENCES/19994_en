ATHENS, Greece -- The three candidates competing to take up the helm of Greece's main opposition party, PASOK, kicked off campaign tours Saturday (October 20th) ahead of leadership elections on November 11th.
Incumbent PASOK president George Papandreou was in Larissa, central Greece, where he addressed a group of Sunday with a call for a "new and clear victory mandate" to secure the party's transformation into a progressive organisation.
His main rival, Evangelos Venizelos, was in Agrinio, where he said PASOK should have won last month's general elections against a government he described as the worst since the fall of the dictatorship.
The third PASOK candidate, Costas Skandalidis, spent the weekend on the island of Crete, warning against "division and polarisation" within the ranks of the movement.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Tens of thousands of Turkish Cypriots joined a protest Friday (January 28th) against austerity measures imposed by Turkey, which controls the northern part of the divided island.
Organisers say about 40,000 people gathered in the central Inonu Square, in the Turkish part of Nicosia.
A general strike was held at the same time.
Protestors criticised authorities for bowing to pressure from Ankara and imposing the austerity measures that have resulted in higher living expenses.
Some carried banners calling for the Cyprus issue to be resolved quickly in order to enable Turkish Cypriots to join the EU.

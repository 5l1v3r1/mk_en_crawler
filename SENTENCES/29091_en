SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors pressed charges Monday (July 5th) against a former Bosnian Serb soldier for crimes against humanity committed in Srebrenica in 1995.
Marko Boskic allegedly took part in the persecution of Bosniak civilians on political, national, ethnic, cultural and religious grounds between July 10th and November 1st 1995.
US authorities deported Boskic to BiH in late April.
He had immigrated to the United States after the conflict, but failed to reveal that he had served in the Bosnian Serb army.
In 2006, he was sentenced for immigration fraud.

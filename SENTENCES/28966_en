ANKARA, Turkey -- A court on Thursday (April 8th) sentenced former lawmaker Leyla Zana of the disbanded Democracy Party (DEP) to three years in prison. 
The court found her guilty of spreading propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation -- the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- in September and November 2008. 
The Constitutional Court closed the DEP in 1994 for links to the outlawed PKK. 
Zana, a Kurdish politician and human rights activist, did not attend Thursday's hearings.

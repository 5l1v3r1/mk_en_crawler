ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (June 10th) criticised the recent Constitutional Court ruling that effectively bans women from wearing headscarves at universities.
Speaking at a parliamentary caucus meeting of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan said the ruling was unconstitutional and urged the court to explain its decision as soon as possible.
The court will also rule on a case aimed at shutting down the AKP for threatening secularism in Turkey.
Erdogan says the AKP-dominated parliament will continue to work until that ruling emerges.

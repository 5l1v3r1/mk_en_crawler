SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- About 200 members of the Islamic Wahhabi movement gathered in front of the parliament building in Sarajevo on Saturday (March 12th) to protest the detention of seven Arabs suspected of posing a threat to national security. 
The suspects, who were arrested over the past few years, are being held in an immigrant centre near Sarajevo pending extradition to their home countries. 
Most of them arrived in BiH during the 1992-1995 war to join the Muslim troops. 
They have families in BiH and refuse to leave. 
BiH laws also prohibit the deportation of people to countries where they could face torture.

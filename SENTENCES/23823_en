BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU issued a statement Monday (April 20th) saying the hard-line National Unity Party's (UBP) victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) should not impact ongoing reunification talks with Greek Cypriots. 
"We do not think that the outcome of the elections ... 
should have a direct bearing on the negotiating process," European Commission spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy said. 
She stressed that TRNC President Mehmet Ali Talat remains in charge of negotiations for the Turkish Cypriots. 
The right-wing UBP won 26 of the 50 seats in parliament with 44% of the vote, ahead of Talat's left-wing Republican Turkish Party, which nabbed 30%.
Talat vowed on Monday that the results would not change the Turkish Cypriots' stance in the reunification talks. 
UBP leader Dervis Eroglu pledged his full support for Talat. 
Cypriot government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou, however, expressed concern that the Greek Cypriot government will face "additional difficulties" in the negotiations, given the UBP victory.
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis kicks off an official visit to Cyprus on Wednesday.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Erhard Busek, says Croatia and Macedonia could be ready for integration in the EU before Turkey. 
In a statement reported in the Macedonian press, Busek noted that Skopje is considerably behind Zagreb in the process. 
He reiterated that the EU should not abandon its earlier pledges regarding stabilisation and EU integration prospects for countries in the Western Balkans.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The issue of Kosovo's status should be resolved by the end of this year, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said on Wednesday (7 June) in Skopje, during a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
"Kosovo needs a clear status," Jessen-Petersen said, stressing the issue's importance to regional stability.
He expressed concern that Kosovo Serbs are unwilling to actively participate in the dialogue on Kosovo status, while appealing to the Albanian majority to understand the solution must be acceptable to the Serb minority as well.
For his part, Buckovski expressed his country's support for the international community's efforts in Kosovo.

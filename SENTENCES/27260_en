BUCHAREST, Romania -- An estimated 45,000 public workers plan a two-hour warning strike Tuesday (February 2nd) demanding higher salaries and job security. 
A larger, general protest has been scheduled for February 12th. 
The government says that given the global financial crisis, it cannot meet demands. 
In a bid to cut spending, the Romanian government said it will need to trim the public workforce. 
Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu has said more than 100,000 jobs will be axed over the next four years.

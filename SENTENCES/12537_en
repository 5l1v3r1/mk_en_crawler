BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic was reportedly sighted twice in the last 20 days, The Guardian reported Monday (9 May). 
He was seen having lunch with his wife in southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina on 14 April and with his brother a week later in Belgrade. 
According to the newspaper's sources at the UN tribunal, prosecutors passed this information on to Serbian authorities in hopes it would help them track down the fugitive war crimes indictee.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN war crimes tribunal has issued an injunction against Croatian reporter Domagoj Margetic, possibly regarding the contents of his personal internet web site. 
Zagreb County Court judge Ratko Scekic confirmed on Wednesday (2 August) receipt of the injunction but said the contents were classified. 
Margetic says he assumes it is connected with the publication, on his internet site, of a list of protected witnesses from the 2004 Hague trial of Bosnian Croat General Tihomir Blaskic. 
He claims that the list was declassified and that he got it from an assistant to chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
Margetic and two other Croatian journalists, Stjepan Seselj and Marijan Krizic, were previously investigated for contempt of court, after they revealed the identity and testimony of a protected witness in the Blaskic trial. 
Last month, del Ponte decided to abandon the proceedings against them.

TIRANA, Albania -- A left-wing member of parliament left the ranks of the Socialist Party (SP) on Wednesday (September 30th) to create a new political formation -- the Justice and Unity Party. 
Shpetim Idrizi is in his second term in parliament and will join forces with Muhedin Tahiri, a high-ranking official from the Justice and Integration Party, which is a partner in the ruling coalition. 
Idrizi did not specify whether he will be joining the ruling coalition, led by the Democratic Party.

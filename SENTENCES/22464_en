DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Prominent Kurdish rights activist Leyla Zana was sentenced to two years in jail Thursday (April 10th) by a court in Diyarbakir for spreading "terrorist" propaganda.
Zana was arrested for remarks she made at a political rally during a Kurdish festival last year.
Zana told supporters that the Kurdish community has three leaders -- Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani of the Kurdish region in northern Iraq and Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
In other news, the Turkish General Staff says 13 PKK rebels were killed in clashes with the army on Thursday.
Two died in Diyarbakir province and 11 others in the province of Tunceli.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday (December14th) called for national unity, and criticised last week's decision by the Constitutional Court to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). 
"Our position against the closure of the DTP is clear ... 
We are against the closure of parties. 
We think individuals should be punished, not a [party] identity," Erdogan told parliament in his first public comment on the issue. 
Meanwhile, protests against the DTP's ban continued in Diyarbakir on Monday where police used tear gas to disperse about 10,000 demonstrators. 
Many arrests were reported after statements by some DTP parliament members who arrived in the city to discuss their future strategy. 
The decision to ban the party -- for suspected ties to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- took effect on Monday.
On Tuesday, police say a shopkeeper opened fire on a crowd s protesting the DTP's closure in the southeast province of Mus, killing two demonstrators. 
Several others were wounded.

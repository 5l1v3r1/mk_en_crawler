TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu has decided to hold Albania's next parliamentary elections on 3 July, according to an announcement from his office Monday (25 April).
The decision followed extensive consultations with the main political powers and the international community.
Noting that the vote would be a crucial test of the country's readiness for Euro-Atlantic integration, Moisiu urged all those involved to comply with legal deadlines.
On Tuesday, the OSCE Presence in Tirana hands over equipment to validate voters' lists to the ministry of local government and decentralisation.

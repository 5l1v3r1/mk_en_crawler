SAMSUN, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on Thursday (17 November) in the Turkish port of Samsun for a ceremony inaugurating the world's deepest undersea pipeline "Blue Stream". 
Jointly built by the three countries, the pipeline will transfer around 16 billion cubic metres of Russian gas annually, covering a distance of over 1,200km between Stavropol, Russia and Ankara. 
The first gas flowed through the pipeline two years ago but the opening ceremony has been delayed by protracted disputes over prices and technical issues.

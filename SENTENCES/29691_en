PODGORICA, Montenegro -- About 200 people organised via Facebook gathered on Wednesday (March 30th) outside the government building in Podgorica in a fresh protest against the economic situation and a perceived lack of will to fight organised crime.
They demanded several resignations, including those of Prime Minister Igor Luksic, Chief Prosecutor Ranka Carapic and Police Director Veselin Veljovic.
Nebojsa Medojevic, leader of the main opposition Movement for Change, also joined the protest.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A total of 48 political parties and 13 independent candidates have submitted applications to register in the October general elections in BiH, according to the Election Central Commission.
The application deadline was Friday (19 May).
By law, the main election body must examine all submitted requests and verify the registrations by 3 June.
In other news, Croatian Democratic Union leader Dragan Covic says the heads of the main BiH political parties will meet on 23 May to resume discussions on constitutional reform.
The talks will take place at the residence of the US Ambassador to BiH, Douglas McElhaney.
According to Covic, the focus now is on building a strong parliamentary majority in favour of the reforms and avoid a repeat of the failure in April, in which the legislation failed to garner the necessary majority..

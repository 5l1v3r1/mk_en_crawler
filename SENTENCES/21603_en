ATHENS, Greece -- Wildfires forced more than 2,000 tourists to evacuate on Friday (July 25th) from the island of Rhodes. 
Greek authorities say they will be allowed to return once smoke dissipates. 
Wildfires burned thousands of acres of pine forests in the region over the past five days before firefighters managed to extinguish the flames Sunday.

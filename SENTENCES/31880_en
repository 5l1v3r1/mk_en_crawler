MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) issued a statement Wednesday (30 October), in support of designating Mostar the capital of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH). 
An OHR spokesperson says the idea would lead to further consolidation of the Muslim and Croat communities in FBiH, but is entirely dependent on the readiness of both communities to make Mostar a truly unified city. 
The proposal originated at the signing of the Madrid Declaration in 1998 within the Peace Implementation Council for BiH. 
Lacking public support, it was re-instated after the parliamentary elections earlier this month.

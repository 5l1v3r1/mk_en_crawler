VIENNA, Austria -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte is urging that additional pressure be exerted on former Yugoslav countries to co-operate with The Hague tribunal.
In a speech to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on Tuesday (4 November), she said "aggressive nationalism" is still powerful in these countries, adding that significant segments of local populations still view fugitive war crimes suspects as heroes.
"And despite some highly commendable gestures by politicians, no serious truth, justice and reconciliation process has been launched in the region", she said.
In other news Tuesday, Serbian-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic called on head of Public Security Sreten Lukic to step down and face the UN war crimes tribunal.
His indictment, made public recently, caused an uproar in Belgrade.

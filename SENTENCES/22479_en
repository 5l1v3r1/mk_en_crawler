PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UNDP accused the government Sunday (July 13th) of failing to take steps to aid the return of Serbs displaced since the former Serbian province declared independence on February 17th.
According to the UNDP, only three Serbs have returned to Kosovo in the past six months.
Thousands of Serb families want to return.
"We have to depoliticise the return process and find a way to secure the 30m euros necessary to fulfil the submitted requests.
Currently, the UNDP can cover the expenses for the building of 20 houses only," said Kim Wetting, manager of the UNDP return programme.
Kosovo's Ministry for Returns and Communities says the UNDP's stringent criteria are to blame.
In other news, the NGO Cohu says the licensing and accreditation process of private higher education institutions in Kosovo is riddled with corruption.
Cohu also directly accused Education Minister Enver Hoxhaj of violating the law on the accreditation of private universities.
Three days ago, the British Council for Accreditation issued a report, saying that according to the Law on Higher Education, Kosovo's Accreditation Agency, and not the ministry of education, is in charge of evaluating and accrediting private universities in Kosovo.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Seven people, including six police officers, were injured in a bomb attack by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Sunday (30 July) on a police complex in Dogubeyazit, eastern Turkey.
A massive manhunt is under way for the perpetrators.
The same day, a Turkish soldier was killed in fighting with PKK terrorists in the eastern province of Bingol.
In the southeastern city of Sanliurfa, meanwhile, police rounded up nearly 130 people who were attending a meeting called by the country's main Kurdish party, the Democratic Society Party.
The authorities say the event was linked to the PKK.
But organisers insist the session was merely aimed at discussing problems in the city.

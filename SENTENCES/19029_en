TIRANA, Albania -- European Commission (EC) Ambassador to Tirana Helmuth Lohan suggested on Wednesday (May 2nd) that the EU disapproves of the possibility of early parliamentary elections, viewing it as a step back for the country.
"Albania needs a period of political stability to move forward in accomplishing reforms under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement," Lohan said after a meeting with Minister of Integration Majlinda Bregu.
Some opposition officials have hinted they would press for early general elections, unless the next president is elected via consensus.

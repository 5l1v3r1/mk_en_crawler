BELGRADE, Serbia -- Czech Ambassador to Serbia Hana Hubackova said on Monday (September 1st) that EU prospects for countries in the Western Balkans will be a top priority when her country assumes the rotating EU presidency in January.
Prague can help Serbia substantially in its EU bid, Hubackova told the daily Vecernje Novosti.
"The Czech Republic is ready to speed up the process of visa liberalisation and put Serbia on the 'white Schengen List', as well as the process of its European integration," she noted.
She said she does not believe the EU will make recognition of Kosovo's independence one of Serbia's conditions.
Rather, Serbia will have to meet the same conditions as all other candidates, Hubackova said.

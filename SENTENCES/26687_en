THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic before the UN war crimes tribunal is now set to begin on October 21st, rather than October 19th, as originally planned, tribunal Judge O-Gon Kwon announced on Tuesday (October 6th). 
The delay was due to administrative issues. 
Kwon added it may be delayed even further if the Appeals Chamber fails to rule within a week on Karadzic's request for a much longer postponement. 
He insists he will not have enough time to prepare his defence. 
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY), Serge Brammertz, on Saturday (March 22nd) denied that Belgrade is no longer co-operating with The Hague due to the declaration of independence by its former province of Kosovo.
In an interview with the Belgrade-based newspaper Blic, Brammertz said he will publish his report on Serbia's co-operation with the ICTY by mid-May and the document will be presented at a UN Security Council session in June.
Asked whether his assessment would open Serbia's road to the EU, he said, "I am a prosecutor and I won't meddle in politics".

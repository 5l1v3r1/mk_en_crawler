PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The division of Kosovo is not an option and NATO will remain the primary guarantor for peace and security, Alliance Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in an exclusive interview with the newspaper Koha Ditore on Friday (January 21st). 
Urging Kosovo institutions to act with responsibility and maturity, he also reassured the public that despite the decreased number of NATO troops in Kosovo, the security situation will not be affected in any way. 
"From the view point of the security -- and this is the part where it has to do with NATO and KFOR -- what we are expecting, and further what I would say also what we request from Kosovo leadership, is to continue with a moderate and constructive approach," Rasmussen said.
As for the recent controversial report by Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty, Rasmussen said he believes that if Marty has proof of his accusations, he will present it to the relevant institutions.

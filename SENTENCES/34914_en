BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic announced Wednesday (17 December) that Serbian police know the whereabouts of Zemun clan leader Milorad ''Legija'' Lukovic.
Speaking at a news conference, he said police do not have access to him, so the time is not right for arrest.
Legija is the prime suspect in the March assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

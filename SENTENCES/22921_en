ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is reportedly planning to create a new political party if his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is banned by the Constitutional Court because of pro-Islamic activities. 
Turkish television channel Kanal D reported on Monday (May 5th) that preparations for the creation of Erdogan's new political formation have already been completed.
According to the media, Erdogan revealed his plans at a meeting with a small group of journalists on Saturday evening. 
Erdogan's press office did not comment on the report. 
A lawsuit filed with the Court seeks to ban 71 members of the AKP, including Erdogan, from political activity for the next five years.

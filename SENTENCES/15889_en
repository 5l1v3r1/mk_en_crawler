BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu issued a statement on Wednesday (16 August) confirming that he has asked for declassification of the Communist-era security police Securitate archives. 
Stressing that this is necessary for Romania's EU accession, Basescu said it is better to debate the matter now, rather than when the country is a Union member. 
He also rejected allegations that he had once been an informer or a collaborator with Securitate and that his file had been hidden or destroyed.

TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE Ambassador Osmo Lipponen and the head of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights mission in Albania, Robert Barry, urged Albanian authorities Tuesday (16 December) to ensure a fair rerun of local elections in Tirana. 
The two officials held a joint press conference following meetings Monday with Prime Minister Fatos Nano, Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Ilirjan Celibashi, and leader of the opposition Democratic Party Sali Berisha. 
The local election in Tirana will be repeated in 118 of the 346 polling stations on 28 December.
In other news, local media reported Tuesday that the government plans to renegotiate customs tariffs with NATO and the EU. 
Tirana says the tariffs would harm national producers and lead to possible bankruptcy for some.

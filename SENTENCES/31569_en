ZAKOPANE, Poland -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic wraps up a two-day visit to Poland Sunday (19 January), after receiving assurances that Warsaw supports his country's aspirations to join NATO and the EU.
Polish President Aleksandar Kwasniewski pledged Saturday to lobby for Croatia's entry into both organisations to boost Euro-Atlantic integration prospects.
Late next month, Croatia plans to file an application to open EU accession talks.

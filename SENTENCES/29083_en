ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor on Monday (July 5th) signed a decree that relieves Ivan Simonovic of his duties as justice minister and proposes Drazen Bosnjakovic, state secretary in the justice ministry since 2008, as his replacement.
Simonovic heads to New York this month to become UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights, the highest appointed Croatian official in an international organisation.
Bosnjakovic was handpicked by Kosor and Simonovic due to his knowledge of work at the ministry.

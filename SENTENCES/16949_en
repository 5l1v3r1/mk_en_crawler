BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (4 May) that his country's credibility has been tarnished by the government's failure to arrest Ratko Mladic.
The EU's decision to break off talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade has dealt a blow to the Serbian people's hope of a better future, Tadic added, criticising Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's failure to make good on his promises to the international community.
Serbia's new isolation, Tadic contended, would also undermine its position at the talks on the future status of Kosovo and would benefit those who want to break up the union between Serbia and Montenegro.
In other news, Economy Minister Predrag Bubalo told reporters that he had learned that police have traced Mladic's movements between April 2002 and the end of 2005.
Initially some 50 people were helping the Bosnian Serb general but their number dropped to ten at the end.
The entire network, Bubalo claimed, has now been dismantled.
A court in Belgrade confirmed that three people were arrested on Thursday for helping Mladic evade justice.

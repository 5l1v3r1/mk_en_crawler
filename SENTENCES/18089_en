WASHINGTON, United States -- The Senate adopted a resolution Friday (March 16th), backing NATO's further enlargement, including the timely admission of the so-called Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- as well as Georgia and Ukraine. 
The measure says these five countries are entitled to US assistance in the preparations for NATO membership. 
The House of Representatives passed the document earlier this month.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal, Serge Brammertz, confirmed on Wednesday (May 6th) that the tribunal has destroyed around 1,000 pieces of evidence from mass graves in the Srebrenica area.
Brammertz was in Sarajevo, where he met with representatives of the Mothers of Srebrenica and Zepa Enclaves associations.
He attributed the decision to destroy the evidence to its poor condition.
However, information about the evidence, which included photographs, personal belongings and pieces of clothing, is on file.
Relatives of the estimated 8,000 Muslim men and boys killed in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre criticised the decision to destroy actual evidence.

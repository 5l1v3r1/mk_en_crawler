ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Ivo Josipovic and Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic met on Wednesday (March 24th) in the Croatian town of Opatija for the first time since Josipovic took office in February.
After informal talks, they pledged to improve relations between their countries and voiced mutual support for the EU integration process.
Josipovic and Tadic agreed that reciprocal genocide lawsuits filed by their countries at the International Court of Justice could be settled out of court.
Tadic stressed that proceedings against those charged with war crimes will not be dropped.

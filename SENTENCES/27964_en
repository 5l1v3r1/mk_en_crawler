THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals chamber of UN war crimes tribunal has turned down a request for former Yugoslav National Army General Vladimir Lazarevic's temporary release, media reported on Tuesday (May 18th). 
Lazarevic had asked the tribunal to allow him to undergo surgery in Nis, Serbia. 
But the judges concluded he failed to provide a valid explanation for why the procedure couldn't be performed in The Netherlands instead. 
In February 2009, Lazarevic was sentenced to 15 years in prison for 1999 war crimes committed against Albanians in Kosovo.

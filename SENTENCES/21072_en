SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Interior Ministry special forces arrested Dzemail Iseini, known as Commander Dzejmi Ssej, on Sunday morning (September 2nd), following his escape from the Idrizovo prison in Skopje about ten days ago.
Iseini was arrested at his home in the village of Lojane, where police found a US-made rocket launcher and six grenades.
At a news conference Sunday, Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska was asked about threats that Iseini's friends and relatives have made against Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and a number of other ministers.
Jankulovska said all such threats would be investigated.
Iseini was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2005 after being convicted of placing bombs at several locations in Macedonia.

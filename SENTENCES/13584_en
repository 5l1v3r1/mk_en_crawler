THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic presented the UN tribunal Tuesday (23 August) with government guarantees for the provisional release of former Yugoslav Army chief Nebojsa Pavkovic.
He is charged with war crimes in Kosovo from 1998-1999.
Stojkovic assured the trial chamber that Pavkovic, who surrendered to the tribunal in April after a lengthy delay, would appear before The Hague tribunal as soon as his trial begins.

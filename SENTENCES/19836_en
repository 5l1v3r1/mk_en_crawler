SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak will organise to meet with the leaders of the six parties in the BiH's state-level ruling coalition on January 25th, HDZ 1990 chairman Bozo Ljubic said on Friday (January 18th). 
The meeting is expected to focus on key police and constitutional reforms. 
BiH has nominated a working group to prepare all police reform-related legislation by February 15th, which the country hopes will convince the EU to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH in the first half of 2008.

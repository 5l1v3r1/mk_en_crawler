BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic said on Monday (24 October) that the largest opposition party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats, should name the future BiH chief negotiator for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU.
BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic had suggested that a Serb should assume the post.
Meanwhile, RS's ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS) announced Monday that it is conducting internal restructuring and changing its financial management, in a bid to remove any suspicion that party funds are used to support war crimes indictees.
SDS hopes to convince the Office of the High Representative to lift sanctions imposed on the party earlier this year.

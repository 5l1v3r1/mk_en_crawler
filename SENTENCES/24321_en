ATHENS, Greece -- A Greek court indicted on Friday (June 12th) two police officers for the murder of 15-year old Alexandros Grigoropoulos in December last year. 
The court extended the policemen's pre-trial detention for another six months and ruled that they should stand trial for the killing, though not date was set. 
Epaminondas Korkoneas, who fired the fatal bullet, has been charged with murder, while his colleague Vassilis Saraliotis faces charges of complicity. 
The December incident triggered Greece's worst street riots in decades.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Tuesday (13 April) that he would consider a possible delay in the 24 April referenda on the reunification of Cyprus if Greece, Turkey and the two governments of the island request more time to campaign among the Cypriot ethnic communities.
The request for the delay came from the Greek Cypriot AKEL party.
In Nicosia, Communications Minister Kikis Kazamias resigned in protest over the Greek Cypriot leadership's opposition to the UN plan.
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash announced he would step down if his people support the reunification plan.
In related news, Turkish Chief of Staff General Hilmi Ozkok said the UN blueprint for Cyprus does not address all of his country's concerns.
He urged the EU to guarantee implementation of the plan's provisions because failure to do so could create future security problems.
In Athens, President Costas Stephanopoulos has asked the Political Party Leaders' Council to hold a meeting Thursday on the UN plan.
Currently, only the opposition PASOK party has voiced support for it.

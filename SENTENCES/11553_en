TIRANA, Albania -- The Democratic Party (DP) continues negotiating with parties it views as potential partners in a new coalition government to be led by DP Chairman Sali Berisha, according to press reports Friday (22 July). 
DP officials Jozefina Topalli and Genc Ruli are handling the current talks with the Republican Party, New Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Party. 
The ethnic minority Union for Human Rights Party (UHRP) confirmed Wednesday that its leader, Vangjel Dule, would meet with Berisha next week. 
UHRP had been a partner of the ruling Socialist Party. 
DP has also invited another ally of the SP, the Agrarian Environmentalist Party, to talks. 
Meanwhile, final results of the 3 July parliamentary elections continue to be delayed by the number of complaints filed.

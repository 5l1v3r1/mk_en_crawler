SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko announced on Saturday (September 12th) the establishment of a team that will prepare an inventory of state property.
Once completed, the inventory will be given to BiH authorities who will begin apportioning the property.
Inzko noted that a similar inventory working group established by the Bosnian government six months ago has not even started work yet.
Finding a solution to the state property issue is one of five objectives set by the Peace Implementation Council to transition the Office of the High Representative into the Office of the EU's Special Representative.

PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Tuesday (11 May) that all Balkan countries would join the EU in the future.
He added that Romania and Bulgaria will become members in 2007, and he characterised Croatia's position as still "in the waiting room".
Verheugen explained that Turkey could play a major role in the EU, but accession would depend on its ability to meet the political criteria for membership.
On 1 May, the EU added ten new members, its largest expansion ever.

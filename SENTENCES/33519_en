SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU will give the green light next week to a new assistance mission to Macedonia, which would succeed the current military force, Concordia.
According to Christina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier Solana, the mission would have a police mandate and would consist of between 150-200 officers, who would arrive in Macedonia shortly before Concordia's mandate ends on 15 December.

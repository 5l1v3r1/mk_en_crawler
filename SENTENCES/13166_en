BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A total of 18 Bulgarian and 35 Romanian observers are joining the European Parliament (EP) as of Monday (26 September), ahead of the planned EU entry of the two countries in 2007.
The observers can attend plenary sessions as well as meetings of EP committees and political caucuses but have no voting rights.
The admission of the Bulgarian and Romanian observers was initially expected in April but was delayed over concerns about the two countries' readiness to accede to the Union on schedule.
In other news, Bulgaria signed seven agreements with Azerbaijan during the course of a two-day visit by Azeri President Ilham Aliyev.
Talks between Aliyev and Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev focused on enhancing business ties and opportunities for joint energy projects.

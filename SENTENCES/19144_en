SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Libya is refusing to allow Bulgarian doctor Zdravko Georgiev, the husband of one of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death under a controversial HIV infection scandal, to leave the country, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Wednesday (February 28th). 
In 1999, Georgiev was arrested along with the nurses and a Palestinian doctor on the HIV infection charges, but was eventually acquitted of the charges. 
He faced other charges however, related to foreign currency. 
When he was later acquitted, prosecutors appealed to the Libyan Supreme Court. 
Sofia says it has been told Georgiev must remain in Libya until the High court rules on the appeal.

MADRID, Spain -- Police have arrested a Serbian national suspected of having served as a hit man for Slobodan Milosevic's regime in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
Veselin Vukotic was arrested at the airport in Madrid where he had arrived from Paris. 
He had been a fugitive for 16 years, travelling on forged documents between Spain, other European countries and South America. 
Vukotic is accused of killing a prominent Kosovo Albanian human rights activist in Brussels in 1990. 
The victim, Enver Hadri, was said to have obtained documents proving that Milosevic's regime had murdered 23 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1989 and 1990. 
A protected witness in Milosevic's trial had mentioned Vukotic as the Yugoslav regime's contract killer. 
He may provide key evidence to the UN war crimes tribunal.

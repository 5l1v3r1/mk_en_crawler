MADRID, Spain -- Montenegrin war crimes suspect Veselin Vlahovic, arrested in Spain earlier this week, admitted on Thursday (March 4th) that he killed more than 100 Muslims in the former Yugoslavia. 
According to Madrid-based daily El Pais, the so-called "Monster of Grbavica", told Spanish police that he killed people and burned their bodies but feels no remorse. 
"Why? 
Because they killed my wife and children," Vlahovic said. 
He also admitted leading a group called the "White Angels", whose members raped women during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Vlahovic is accused of the murder; rape and torture of non-Serbs while a member of a paramilitary unit from 1992 to 1993. 
He is wanted by Montenegrin, Serbian and Bosnian authorities.

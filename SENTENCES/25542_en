BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Emil Boc announced his cabinet late on Sunday (December 20th), a total of 17 members, including himself.
According to new information, four will represent the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR), the Liberal Democratic Party's (PDL) coalition partner, while the rest are either PDL members or non-partisans close to the party.
Nominees will appear before relevant parliamentary committees on Tuesday, with a vote by the full parliament expected on Wednesday.
If approved, the cabinet will meet for the first time on Thursday, when it is expected to adopt the 2010 budget bill.
Boc announced that the cabinet would follow the same policies it promoted in 2008, when the PDL-Social Democratic Party coalition was formed.
This includes considerable fiscal consolidation, required by the IMF.

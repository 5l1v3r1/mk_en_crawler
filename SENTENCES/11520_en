BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic told local media on Friday (18 February) that he expects talks on determining Kosovo's final status to start up this summer.
Reiterating his opposition to independence for Kosovo, he also criticised Serbs' non-participation in the decentralisation process, adding that Belgrade lacked a clear and consistent strategy.
Also on Friday, Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic met with UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.
Afterwards, Ivanovic said a compromise solution to the problem of electricity cuts to Serb settlements had been reached.
In other news, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Saturday that Montenegro would conduct an independence referendum in February 2006, unless an agreement on the arrangement of a union of two independent states was reached with Serbia by then.
He said authorities in Podgorica were ready to hold talks with Belgrade before the end of this year.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Friday (September 18th) that the break-up of BiH is not an option, adding that the international community should work to protect the country's integrity.
His statement followed comments by Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and the Serb member of the country's tripartite presidency, Nebojsa Radmanovic, mentioning a potential break-up.
"The international community is in BiH in order to protect its integrity and sovereignty.
I think that this is what BiH's neighbours want as well," Inzko said.

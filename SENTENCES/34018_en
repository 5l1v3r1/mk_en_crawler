PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (30 July) to elect Ranko Krivokapic as its new speaker. 
The move came after three months of bickering following the election of Filip Vujanovic, the former speaker, to Montenegro's presidency. 
Krivokapic is the leader of the Social Democratic Party, which backed the election of Vujanovic in return for the right to nominate his successor. 
The Social Democrats also insisted on the removal of State Prosecutor Bozidar Vukcevic over a sex trade scandal. 
He finally agreed to step down earlier this month, clearing the way for the election of a new speaker. 
Parliament on Wednesday elected Vesna Medenica, a judge from Podgorica, to replace him. 
The opposition did not take part in either vote, as it has been staging a boycott since 1 June.

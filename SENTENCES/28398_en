BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged Alliance members Thursday (September 16th) to reconsider the pace of their troop reductions from Kosovo, and to avoid unilateral moves. 
Rasmussen was speaking to journalists after talks in Brussels with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas. 
"All partners within KFOR are right now considering a reduction of the military presence â¦ The problem is that in total, the reductions seem to be too big, and we have to make sure that even if we scale down we will still have a presence in Kosovo to sufficiently ensure stability and peace," Rasmussen said. 
Earlier this month, Czech Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra announced that Prague intends to reduce its contingent in Kosovo and boost troops in Afghanistan.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country will not encounter major accession problems if it keeps up the current pace of reforms in its agricultural sector, EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said on Friday (14 July).
In its progress report in May, the EU criticised Bucharest for its lack of fully operational payment agencies to receive EU farm aid, for an obsolete system for animal registration and a lack of facilities to collect and treat animal by-products.
Kyprianou said Romania must now focus its efforts on controlling swine fever outbreaks and improving waste management.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg convicted Turkey on Tuesday (June 24th) for the deaths of two Greek Cypriots in 1996. 
Turkish forces beat the first victim, Anastasios Isaak, during a protest against the Turkish military presence on the island. 
They fatally shot Solomos Solomou three days later at Isaak's funeral after he and other protesters entered the buffer zone between the Greek and the Turkish parts of the island and took down a Turkish flag. 
The court ordered Ankara to pay 340,000 euros in damages to the victims' families after ruling that Turkish security officers used unjustified force against the two men.

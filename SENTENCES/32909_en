SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A regional conference titled "European Perspectives for Accession of Southeast Europe Countries" opened in Skopje on Thursday (29 May).
The two-day forum aims to review each country's progress towards integration.
Addressing participants, Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska said the recent collaboration by Southeast European states in their preparations for the upcoming EU summit in Thessaloniki shows how well they could work together.
Also Thursday, NATO lobbyist Bruce Jackson met in Skopje with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski to discuss the Adriatic Charter on strategic partnership recently signed by the United States, Macedonia, Albania and Croatia.

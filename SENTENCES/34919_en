ZAGREB, Croatia -- A Croatian family was stunned when a postcard sent by a friend arrived just in time for Christmas, but ten years late. 
Zarko and Kata Pervan initially thought that someone was playing a bad joke on them -- the sender of the card, a friend called Amir, had died a few years earlier. 
Taking a closer look, they saw that the card had in fact been sent on 21 December 1993 from Zagreb, just 10 km from their home.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU military mission Concordia has contributed to improved security in the country, said German Adm Rainer Feist, who arrived in Skopje on Tuesday (29 July) to inspect the troops and hold talks with Macedonian Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski. 
Feist, who holds overall command of the EU operation and is second in command of NATO forces in Europe, said he believes Macedonia would be capable of taking full responsibility for its security after Concordia wraps up its mandate on 15 December.

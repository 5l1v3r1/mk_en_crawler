SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Decertified BiH police officers, who have been on a hunger strike since the start of this week, decided on Friday (December 15th) to temporarily freeze their protest action until January 15th, 2007.
According to Nenad Starcevic, the chair of the Association of Decertified Policemen from Republika Srpska (RS), they agreed to suspend the strike after a meeting with BiH Minister for Human Rights Mirsad Kebo, who told them that the BiH government would form a special commission to revise the certification process.
The policemen were decertified by the ex-UN International Police Task Force between 1996 and 2002.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The left-wing opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) said Thursday (20 March) it might consider launching a no-confidence motion against the government over its decision to join the US-led coalition against Iraq.
BSP leader Sergey Stanishev said that the government violated the constitution, since the resolution approved by parliament did not authorise the cabinet to make such a decision.

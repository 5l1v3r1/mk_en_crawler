PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral James Stavridis said in Pristina on Wednesday (December 9th) that the number of KFOR troops will be reduced from about 14,000 to 10,000 by the end of January. 
Stavridis added that this decision was based on progress Kosovo has made over the past year. 
"This indicates that the country is moving forward," he said. 
According to Stavridis, Kosovo should serve as an example to other countries in which NATO troops are deployed.

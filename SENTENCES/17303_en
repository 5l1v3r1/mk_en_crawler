ZAGREB, Croatia -- Ivica Racan, former Croatian prime minister and ex-leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), passed away at a Zagreb hospital early Sunday (April 29th), following a brief but grave illness, according to an SDP statement.
Racan, 63, was diagnosed with kidney and brain cancer in January and had undergone several surgeries in Croatia and abroad.
Initial statements from the Croatian parliamentary powers described Racan's death as a great loss for the domestic political stage.
They stressed Racan's role in the establishment of an independent Croatia and the democratisation of Croatian society.

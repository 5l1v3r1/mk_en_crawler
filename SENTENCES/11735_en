SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Minister for European Affairs Meglena Kuneva said Monday (20 December) that the European Commission (EC) will conduct two peer reviews of judicial sector reforms next year -- in January-February and November.
Kuneva stressed that Bulgarian institutions should make every effort to implement adequate reforms, as the results of the EU partner monitoring would be crucial to the country's EU entry in 2007.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade's Special Court for Organised Crime on Wednesday (May 23rd) found 12 men guilty of the March 2003 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
All the defendants, who include members of the secret police and of the Zemun criminal clan, denied the charges. 
The trial has been ongoing since December 2003. 
The mastermind and the sniper, former policemen Milorad "Legija" Ulemek and Zvezdan Jovanovic, respectively, were sentenced to 40 years in prison. 
Prosecutors maintain that Djindjic was gunned down to prevent him from carrying out pro-Western reforms, including the extradition of war crimes suspects to the UN tribunal at The Hague. 
In 2001, Djindjic handed former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic over to the tribunal. 
Around 100 people -- many carrying flags of Djindjic's Democratic Party -- protested outside the court as the sentences were handed out.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic attended a meeting of the Advisory Group of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council regarding security and prospects for Southeast Europe on Thursday (4 May) in Dubrovnik. 
In his address, he stressed the progress made by Southeast European countries towards Euro-Atlantic integration, in spite of the fact the region is still dealing with the consequences of the conflicts in the 1990s. 
He also noted the new security challenges facing the region in terms of fighting organised crime and terrorism.
After the session, Mesic met with NATO Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs and Security Policy Martin Erdmann. 
Croatia expects to receive an invitation to join NATO in 2007 or 2008.

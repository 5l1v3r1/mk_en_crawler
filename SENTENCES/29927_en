ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police arrested Bojan Milkovic, CEO of the Croatian state energy company INA, Friday (March 25th) on suspicion of bribery.
His office and Zagreb apartment were searched.
Local media reported that the allegations stem from his earlier tenure as director of Crosco, an INA subsidiary.
"We hope that after the investigation is over, the charges against Milkovic will be proved groundless," INA said in a statement.

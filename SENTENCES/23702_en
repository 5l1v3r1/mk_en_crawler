ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament early Monday (December 22nd) adopted the country's 2009 budget after five days of debate, despite strong opposition by powerful trade unions and student groups. 
The vote was close, 151-146, and went along party lines. 
During the debate, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called on all parties to show "political maturity, unity and responsibility" by supporting the budget. 
Karamanlis accused main opposition party PASOK leader George Papandreou of showing "indifference in the face of the current situation". 
Papandreou said the ruling conservatives are "incapable" of tackling the impact of the global economic crisis and called again for early elections.

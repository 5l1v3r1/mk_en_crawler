BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic will serve as acting interior minister until a proper candidate is nominated for the post, the government of the Serb entity said Tuesday (6 July).
Former Interior Minister Zoran Djeric was among 60 officials sacked last week by the chief international officer in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, because of the entity's failure to arrest war crimes suspects.
Also Tuesday, a court in Mostar sentenced Bosnian Croat Mario Matic to six years in prison for murdering a Muslim detainee during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Matic was a member of the Bosnian Croat military police.
Meanwhile, an appeals panel at the UN war crimes tribunal confirmed the conviction of Mitar Vasiljevic, a Bosnian Serb who participated in the murder of five Muslims in Visegrad during the war.
He will serve his 15-year sentence in an Austrian prison.

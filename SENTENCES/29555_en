BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) launched a no-confidence motion against Education Minister Daniel Funeriu on Wednesday (March 31st), backed by lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party.
The motion criticises policies in the sector, including the government decision not to fully pay back wages owed to teachers.
This occurred when the government cancelled a promised 50% hike in all teachers' salaries, leaving most with a 17% raise.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Police detained on Thursday (April 1st) former Defence Minister Nikolay Tsonev over a suspected bribery scheme.
Earlier in the day, a former chief secretary at the finance ministry and a judge were also arrested.
The secretary allegedly acted as an intermediary for Tsonev, who is already charged with abuse of office, to bribe a judge in criminal proceedings against him.
Tsonev is charged with signing contracts that cost the state million of euros.
According to the indictment, Bulgaria overpaid about 4m euros for goods.

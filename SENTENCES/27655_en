ATHENS, Greece -- A labour ministry official announced on Thursday (August 26th) that the country has been spending millions to pay pensions to people long dead.
Deputy Labour Minister George Koutroumanis says of the estimated 500 people aged over 110 who have been receiving pensions, more than 300 have died, and in some cases, many years ago.
"We have discovered that a pension has been paid out to a person who died in 1999, and we also found cases where pensions were paid to people who died five to seven years ago," Koutroumanis said.
He added authorities are currently looking into the situation.
Separately Thursday, the opposition New Democracy party accused Prime Minister George Papandreou of approving spending for special advisers despite harsh measures to cut Greece's huge budget deficit.
"It appears that money does exist," New Democracy spokesperson Panos Panagiotopoulos told Net TV.
"Not, of course, for wage-earners and pensioners, but for the army of advisers Mr. Papandreou has hired for his personal office." (Net TV, Bloomberg, BBC, DPA, The Guardian, RFI - 26/08/10)

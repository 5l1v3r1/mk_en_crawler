BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greece's 2009 budget deficit amounted to 15.4% of its GDP, worse than the 13.6% figure reported in April, Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, announced on Monday (November 15th).
The revised data forced authorities in Athens to revise their budget-cutting target to 9.4% for this year, instead of its earlier target of 7.8%.
The data was released as a delegation from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the IMF arrives on a two-day mission to Athens.
Its aim is to review and draft a progress report on Greece's performance in implementing measures to bring its economy in check and receive the next 9 billion-euro tranche of its 110 billion-euro bailout loan.
In an interview with the Proto Thema newspaper on Sunday, Prime Minister George Papandreou said Greece may have to seek more time before it starts repaying the loan.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- About 500 Kosovars gathered on Saturday (January 8th) in the southern part of Mitrovica to protest a report by Council of Europe Rapporteur Dick Marty. 
The demonstration was organised by NGO Rilindia and war veterans from the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
The protest was held among heavy police presence and took place without incident. 
Marty's report, released in December, contains allegations against Kosovo leaders of weapons, drugs and human organ trafficking.

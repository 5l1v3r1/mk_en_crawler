BELGRADE, Serbia -- Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda will seek compensation from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for his arrest, his wife Slobodanka told Belgrade-based media B92 on Sunday (May 1st).
She refuted allegations by Croatian media that her husband would file a suit against Belgrade for the detention.
Purda was detained in February at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant.
Authorities in Belgrade suspected him of involvement in war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar early in the 1992-1995 conflict.
But Serbian prosecutors dropped the case last month due to lack of evidence.

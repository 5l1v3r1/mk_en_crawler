ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul expressed concern Wednesday (May 20th) that a possible embezzlement trial of him may harm the image of his office, media reported. 
"The presidency is the highest office in Turkey and represents the unity of the Turkish nation. 
... 
These are issues concerning Turkey's prestige," Gul told a news conference. 
He rejects the fraud allegations against him. 
On Monday, a court in Ankara ruled Gul should stand trial in a fraud case involving missing party funds, despite his immunity as head of state. 
The alleged fraud case dates back to the late 1990s, and involves the Welfare Party, a predecessor of the ruling Justice and Development Party.

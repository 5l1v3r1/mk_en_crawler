BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Saturday (October 25th) that Serbia will become an EU candidate country next year and a full member in 2014.
"There are no overnight revolutions in European integration.
This is a long and painstaking process.
But I am exceptionally determined and absolutely dedicated to this issue," Djelic told the Vecernje Novosti newspaper.
He noted that Hague war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz arrives in Belgrade next month, and will present his report on Serbia's progress in co-operating with the tribunal -- the key EU requirement -- in December.

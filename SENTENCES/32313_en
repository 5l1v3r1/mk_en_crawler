BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav Interior Minister Zoran Zivkovic confirmed Friday (1 November) that a private company made one illegal shipment of weapons to Liberia in violation of UN sanctions. 
He could not confirm UN allegations that six shipments totalling 200 tonnes of arms and equipment were made between June and August. 
The Yugoslav firm Temex made the deal using certificates from the Nigerian government, which showed it as the end recipient of the arms. 
The documents were later found to be false. 
Zivkovic added that more than 30 private companies were currently being investigated for possible violations.

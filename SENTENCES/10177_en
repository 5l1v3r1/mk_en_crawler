SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In a speech at the University for National and World Economy in Sofia on Monday (27 September), US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Pardew again urged the government to crack down on corruption and organised crime.
While the country has already managed to achieve a stable, functioning market economy with considerable investment opportunities, its image continues to suffer from problems related to crime and corruption as well as the excessive bureaucracy, said Pardew.

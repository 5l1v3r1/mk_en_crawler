BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A former Serb soldier admitted on Thursday (1 September) that he took part in the execution of 200 Croat prisoners of war at a farm in 1991. 
Boza Latinovic testified as a protected witness in the trial of 16 Serbs accused of executing the Croats after Serb forces captured the city of Vukovar. 
He told the judges that one of the defendants, Stanko Vujanovic, commanded the firing squad. 
The trial is viewed as a major test of Serbia's new war crimes court.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- After negotiations with President Ion Iliescu, the major political parties say they reached an informal agreement Tuesday (28 January) to back a declaration in support of EU accession.
The consultations should also result in recommendations for amendments to the constitution and election laws.
In other news, leaders of the opposition Liberal Party and Democrat Party announced they would agree to hold the next parliamentary elections in early 2005 instead of late 2004, in an effort to separate the parliamentary and presidential elections.

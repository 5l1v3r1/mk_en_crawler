SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik announced on Friday (October 30th) that he is withdrawing from talks on constitutional reforms aimed at speeding BiH's EU and NATO accession. 
Dodik has rejected a series of reforms proposed by the EU and the United States, describing them as "unconstitutional and aimed against the Serbs". 
On Friday, he organised a meeting in Banja Luka, inviting prominent politicians to continue dialogue on issues he views as important to the functioning of the state. 
However, all state-level government parties as well as most opposition ones boycotted the meeting. 
Only state-level Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, a member of Dodik's Union of Independent Social Democrats, and three very small parties turned up. 
In comparison, seven of the main Muslim, Croat and Serb parties had attended two rounds of the EU and US-led talks at Camp Butmir, near Sarajevo, in October.

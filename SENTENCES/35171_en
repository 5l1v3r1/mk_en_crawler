BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Boris Tadic, the reformist Democratic Party candidate, is likely to win Sunday's (27 June) Serbian presidential run-off, according to a poll released Tuesday. 
The Strategic Marketing Agency found that Tadic would win if more than 2 million of Serbia's 6.5 million registered voters go to the polls. 
The agency projects a turnout of 2.5 million. 
Extreme nationalist Tomislav Nikolic was ahead as the race started, but his support has declined since the leaders of the pro-democracy parties endorsed Tadic's candidacy.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The four reformist parties that won seats in parliament in the last election postponed the parliamentary speaker election on Friday (30 January) because they could not agree on the programme of the next cabinet. 
No new date has been set for the next session of the assembly. 
Failure to elect a speaker could lead to new general elections.
Meanwhile, the Montenegrin news agency MINA quoted unnamed sources from the ruling coalition Saturday as saying that the director of the local Centre for Regional and Strategic Studies, Miodrag Vlahovic, will become Montenegro's foreign minister. 
Vlahovic will replace Dragisa Burzan, who will become Serbia-Montenegro's ambassador to the UK.

THESSALONIKI, Greece - The UN's special adviser for Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, said Friday (28 May) that he hopes the Greek Cypriot side will reconsider UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's reunification plan and come to support it.
He indicated that he had been surprised by Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos's rejection of the plan, and did not rule out the possibility that a new one would be drafted.
De Soto commended Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis for his assistance in efforts to find an acceptable solution.

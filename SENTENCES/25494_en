ATHENS, Greece -- The Coast Guard issued a statement Sunday (November 22nd) denying international media reports that a Greek cargo vessel had been seized by armed pirates off Yemen's coast on November 16th.
Authorities say the bulk carrier "Red Sea Spirit" was indeed attacked by two pirate speedboats but managed to elude them.
The ship's owner, shipping company Sekur Holdings Inc, said the vessel is continuing its course to Karachi, Pakistan.

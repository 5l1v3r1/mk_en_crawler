BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Austrian State Secretary Hans Winkler encouraged Albania to play a positive and constructive role in the Western Balkans, particularly regarding the Kosovo status issue, during the EU Foreign Ministers Troika-Albania meeting in Brussels on Tuesday (21 March).
According to media reports in Tirana, discussions touched on a recent remark by Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj concerning borders in the region.
The reports say the EU representatives were satisfied with Mustafaj's clarification.
He says his statement, which drew strong reactions from Macedonia and Serbia, was taken out of context.
On Wednesday, media in Tirana reported that the European Commission has asked the EU Council to formally endorse the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Albania.
Three years of SAA talks wrapped up in late January.

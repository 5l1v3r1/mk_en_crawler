TETOVO, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski confirmed on Saturday (April 14th) that he extended an invitation to the small ethnic Albanian opposition Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP) to join the government. 
During a visit to the Tetovo region, Gruevski said the doors of the ruling coalition were open to PDP and the issue would be subject to direct talks with his VMRO-DPMNE formation. 
On Friday, local media reported that Gruevski met with Ali Ahmeti, chairman of the main ethnic Albanian opposition group, the Democratic Union for Integration, in a bid to re-establish long stalled political dialogue.

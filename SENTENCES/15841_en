NEW YORK, United States -- The importance of a shared regional vision involving stability, tolerance and co-operation was highlighted by four Western Balkan leaders in their addresses Wednesday (20 September) to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Albania's President Alfred Moisiu, Bosnia and Herzegovina's Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and his Croatian and Montenegrin counterparts, Ivo Sanader and Milo Djukanovic respectively, each stressed a willingness to leave divisions behind and focus instead on collaboration.
They also reaffirmed their countries' aspirations to join Euro-Atlantic structures.

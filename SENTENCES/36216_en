PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Dialogue resumed between Serbia and Kosovo Thursday (4 March), after having been on hold since late last year. 
A Serbian delegation arrived in Pristina, the site of the talks, marking the first official visit by Serbian officials to the province since the Kosovo conflict in 1999. 
The first topic is energy issues, while next week the focus will be on missing persons. 
The aim is to address practical issues that do not pertain directly to Kosovo's final status.

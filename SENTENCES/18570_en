NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The international community is praising the decision by Greek Cypriot authorities to dismantle a wall that has divided Nicosia into Greek and Turkish sectors for more than 30 years. 
The concrete barrier at central Ledra Street disappeared on Friday (9 March) and was replaced with sheets of aluminium. 
In separate statements, UN envoy for Cyprus Michael Moller, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe President Rene van der Linden praised the move as a positive contribution.

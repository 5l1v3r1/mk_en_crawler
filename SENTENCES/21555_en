ANKARA, Turkey -- A leading member of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) said Friday (May 23rd) accused the Turkish judiciary of apparently losing its independence.
The latest developments in the Supreme and Constitution courts regarding the headscarf ban case and the lawsuit to close the AKP bespeak political interference in the judiciary, AKP Deputy Chairman Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat said.
"Efforts to use the law to politicise issues reveal that it is being manipulated," he said.
Firat also said that there is no opposition element that truly helps to strengthen Turkey's democracy.
Separately, Friday clashes in southeastern Turkey killed three rebels from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and one village guard.
Anadolu Agency also disclosed that a PKK bomb derailed five cars of a train on Saturday but did not report any injuries.

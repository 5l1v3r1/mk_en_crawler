BERLIN, Germany -- Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Wednesday (10 March) that Turkey should be included in any EU enlargement. 
His comment was the latest in a series by EU leaders and German politicians, stressing Turkey's strategic importance in relation to EU security and foreign policy issues. 
Some within the EU have expressed scepticism, however, arguing that inclusion of Turkey would stretch the boundaries of the Union to troubled regions, particularly the Middle East. 
The situation there will be among the topics discussed next week when Jordanian King Abdullah II arrives on a two-day official visit to Turkey.

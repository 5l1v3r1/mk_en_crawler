PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Voters in the newly created Serb-dominated municipality of Partesh/Partes went to the polls on Sunday (June 20th) to elect local leaders.
Turnout topped 65%.
It appears a mayoral run-off will be required, as no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.
According to unofficial results presented by the NGO Democracy in Action, the leader of the Zavicaj association, Nenad Cvetkovic, came close with 47.4% of votes and will head into a runoff against Todor Mirkovic of the United Serbian List, who won 25.5%.
US Ambassador Christopher Dell praised the elections, which apparently went off without incident.

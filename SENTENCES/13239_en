SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev returned from a daylong meeting in Brussels on Monday evening (29 August), saying he is moderately optimistic about the country's EU entry in 2007. 
He told reporters that during meetings with the Bulgarian delegation, European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and other EC members gave broadly positive signals that the safeguard clause -- which allows for a one-year delay if accession commitments are not met -- would not be activated. 
According to Stanishev, EC Vice President Guenter Verheugen noted that Bulgaria is at least as well-prepared for membership as the ten new EU members were 16 months prior to their entry.

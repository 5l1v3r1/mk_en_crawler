SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Most leaders of the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) oppose the concept for the new government of Republika Srpska proposed by Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic, according to an article in Friday's (21 January) Nezavisne Novine.
Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said the PDP has not made a final decision yet, and has told Bukejlovic that it would like to talk with five other Serb parties about the situation in the Council of Ministers.
The RS cabinet resigned last month after international sanctions were imposed.

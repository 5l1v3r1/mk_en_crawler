BUCHAREST, Romania -- Several thousand people from across the country rallied on Sunday (April 22nd) in support of embattled President Traian Basescu, who was suspended by Parliament on Thursday for violating his constitutional powers.
The rally was organised by several NGOs, though opposition parties says it was Basescu's own Democratic Party that was behind it.
Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu, Interior Minister Cristian David and Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu, meanwhile, worked to assure the international community, particularly the EU, that the situation is not affecting the country's foreign policy agenda, nor the pace of judicial reforms and anti-corruption efforts.
Both David and Chiuariu met with EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini on the sidelines of a meeting in Luxembourg late last week.

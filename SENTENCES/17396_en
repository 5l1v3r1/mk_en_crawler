BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn met with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic on Wednesday (June 27th) and suggested that Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with Serbia could be wrapped up and the accord initialled in September or October.
He added, though, that Belgrade must take steps that will lead to the arrest and extradition of Ratko Mladic and the other remaining fugitives wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal.
Regarding Kosovo, Rehn and Jeremic agreed that the UN Security Council must decide on the province's future status.
During a separate meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Jeremic voiced concern over the security situation in the province, calling on KFOR to protect the Serbian minority and other non-Albanians there.

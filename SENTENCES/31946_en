BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Tuesday (26 November), Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told a group of senior government, military and international officials of a plan to slash the number of army personnel from 75,000 to 45,000 over the next ten years.
At least 10,000 will be cut next year alone, he said, adding that the current size is beyond needs and financial capabilities.
Svilanovic acknowledged the reform process will be long and difficult, but promised a smaller and better-equipped force in the end.
He reiterated the government's desire to join the Partnership for Peace programme in 2003 - something NATO welcomes, as long as it is coupled with military reform and better co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon announced on Sunday (December 14th) that an EULEX office will soon open in Belgrade.
"We need connections with all the countries around [Kosovo] in order to be able to work together also outside Kosovo with missions such as Europol, Interpol, etc.," de Kermabon said during a visit to Peja.
Separately Sunday, Kosovo Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti said the EULEX mission will serve as a link between Serbs in the north and Kosovo institutions.
He told Voice of America that there will be no more incidents related to the international civil presence and that the rule of law and order are what citizens need most.
On Saturday, former UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen weighed in as well.
He said that despite the fact EULEX was deployed based on a six-point plan adopted by the UN Security Council, the mission cannot be status neutral, as 22 out of the 27 EU member states have recognised Kosovo's independence.

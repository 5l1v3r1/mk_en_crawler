PRISTINA, Kosovo -- International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith has criticised the EU Rule of Law mission (EULEX) for not being proactive enough. 
In an interview with the newspaper Zeri on Monday (May 23rd), Feith said he expected much more from the EU mission, in particular with regards to the strengthening of rule of law. 
"I truly think that EULEX should be more proactive in the north and we have to see actions being undertaken against certain criminals there who have no sort of legitimacy," he said.

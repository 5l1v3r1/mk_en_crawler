BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new World Bank report suggests that progress in Romania's judicial reform has slowed, and in some areas, has simply halted. 
Steps to decrease the number of courts have not been taken since 2006, judges continue to be appointed without having taken aptitude tests, and the country's Superior Magistracy Council (CSM) has blocked an initiative meant to identify the factors holding back the judiciary's performance, media reports quoted the study as saying.
The Bank's criticisms drew a sharp response from the CSM, which accused the institution of having overstepped its bounds. 
It insisted that Bank-financed reform projects will be completed on schedule.

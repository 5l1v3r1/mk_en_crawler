ATHENS, Greece -- Officials lighted the torch for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin on Sunday (27 November). 
Overcast skies forced the organisers to use a back-up flame that had been lit at a dress rehearsal a day earlier. 
The torch is normally lit using a concave steel mirror to focus the sun's rays. 
The Olympic flame will be carried across Greece by 534 runners before it is handed to the Italians on 6 December.

TIRANA, Albania -- International Women's Day on Tuesday (March 8th) was marked in Tirana with a rally by women supporting the political opposition. 
Socialist Party (SP) lawmaker Mimi Kodheli vowed her party will not make the "same mistakes" as the current Democratic Party-led cabinet when it gets into power. 
Instead, she said the SP will focus on more schools, jobs and better life in general, while reducing corruption and violence.

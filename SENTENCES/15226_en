ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer flew to Russia on Wednesday (28 June) on an official visit aimed at boosting bilateral economic ties. 
The focus is on ways to bolster trade, as well as on ideas for building a new oil pipeline that would help cut tanker traffic across the crowded Bosporus Straits. 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul visited Moscow earlier in the week to lay the groundwork for the trip.
Also Wednesday, local media reported that a new operation to combat bribery and corruption was conducted at the Habur border crossing with Iraq. 
At least 30 people reportedly were arrested, including customs employees.

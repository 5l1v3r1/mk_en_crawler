SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The parliament of Republika Srpska (RS) voted Wednesday (25 February) to allow the government to sign an agreement setting up a central judicial council. 
The new High Judicial and Prosecution Council will appoint judges and prosecutors in both of BiH's entities. 
The Muslim-Croat Federation and RS would retain their independent justice ministries. 
Establishing the new council is one of 16 conditions BiH must meet to start negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Also Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer assured BiH officials that his country supports Sarajevo's aspirations for membership in the EU and NATO. 
He noted, however, that signing a stabilisation agreement and joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme both hinge on co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

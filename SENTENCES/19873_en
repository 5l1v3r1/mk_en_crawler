ATHENS, Greece -- Strikes continued in Greece on Thursday (March 20th) as parliament approved the controversial pension system reform bill that will cut benefits and increase the retirement age.
Lawyers, teachers, journalists, municipal servants and the public transport in most cities, including Athens, have joined the general strike organised by the two largest trade unions in the country.
The largest one, the General Confederation of Workers in Greece, is calling for a nationwide referendum on the pension reforms, insisting the public should have a say on such an important issue.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The number of confirmed swine flu cases is climbing but authorities say the pace at which the virus is spreading is below expectations.
The health ministry confirmed on Sunday (November 15th) seven new cases, for a total of 39, though epidemiologists believe the actual number is far higher.
On Saturday, the health ministry reported Kosovo's first confirmed swine flu death.
In Albania, meanwhile, the Public Health Institute announced on Sunday 19 new swine flu cases, bringing the total number to 76.
Authorities say the situation is under control and that none of the cases are serious.

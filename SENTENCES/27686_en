BELGRADE, Serbia -- The trial of a Serbian student accused of assaulting a fellow student in New York two years ago opened on Monday (June 28th) in Belgrade, but was postponed almost immediately when his lawyer failed to appear. 
In March, prosecutors filed charges against Miladin Kovacevic for inflicting "severe bodily harm with possible deadly consequences", stemming from an assault against a fellow university student in the United States. 
Bryan Steinhauer, 22, of Brooklyn, New York, sustained skull fractures and a severe brain injury during a fight with Kovacevic in May 2008 at a bar near Binghamton University in upstate New York. 
Kovacevic is also accused of falsifying documents that allowed him to leave the US after the incident. 
Proceedings are set to resume on September 13th.

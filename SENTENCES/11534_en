SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Commander Major General David Leakey met with the heads of the BiH law enforcement agencies Friday (20 May) to discuss issues related to fighting organised crime.
According to a EUFOR statement, participants stressed that organised crime posed an obstacle to BiH's development and its bid for EU integration.
During a two-day trip to Washington, meanwhile, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic called for sustained US involvement in the country.
Following a meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Nicholas Burns, Terzic said the future of the Balkans would largely depend on a continued US role.
He also met the incoming director of the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz, who reaffirmed the Bank's support for BiH reforms.

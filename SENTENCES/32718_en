BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Monday (16 December), President Vojislav Kostunica met with the ambassadors of the 15 members of the UN Security Council.
Afterwards, his office issued a statement saying he had stressed the need for more efforts by the international community to ensure the return of Serb refugees to Kosovo.
The delegation spent the weekend in the province, noting that while security has significantly improved over the past 18 months, the process of refugee returns must be stepped up.

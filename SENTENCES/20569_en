SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski said on Friday (September 7th) that he would support the draft amendment to the election law, submitted by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE. 
Crvenkovski said he favours the idea of guaranteeing more seats in parliament for smaller minority groups as long as there are no hidden agendas behind it. 
The amendment boosts the number of seats in parliament by 13 to provide additional representation of smaller minority groups and the diaspora. 
Both the main opposition Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia and the Democratic Union for Integration oppose the effort.
In other news, a new party representing ethnic Albanians in Macedonia was established Sunday in Tetovo. 
Called the Democratic Union of Albanians, its founder is Berdil Mahmudi, a former member of the Democratic Party of Albanians.

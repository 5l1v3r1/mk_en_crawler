BELGRADE, Serbia -- The National Security Council met for five hours Tuesday (February 26th) in response to last week's rioting over Kosovo independence.
No formal statement was issued.
B92 radio reports, however, that the Council decided all actions against countries that recognise Kosovo's independence must be evaluated first to determine if they have long-term economic and political consequences.
It was also reportedly agreed that all security-related institutions must prevent further violence in Serbia and that wearing army uniforms of any kind during protests would be banned.
The National Security Council includes the president;
prime minister;
justice, defence and interior ministers;
the chiefs of the army and the various intelligence services.

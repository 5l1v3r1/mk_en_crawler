SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following an audit that turned up evidence of embezzlement at Mostar's electricity company, Elektroprivreda HZHB, the Federation of BiH Energy Ministry appointed an interim manager, Vlado Maric, on Friday (7 March).
The entire executive board was dismissed last week after the Office of the High Representative presented its report and demanded sanctions against the corrupt managers.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj appeared before the UN tribunal on Thursday (March 1st) to plead not guilty to charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
The former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander is accused of involvement in the murder, rape and torture of Serbs and suspected ethnic Albanian Serb collaborators between 1998 and 1999. 
Haradinaj will be tried with two other former KLA fighters, Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj, when the trial opens on Monday. 
They face 37 war crimes charges and could face life in prison if convicted of a single charge.

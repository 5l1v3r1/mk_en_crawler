TUZLA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Tuzla cantonal prosecutors filed an indictment Tuesday (February 13th) against a former Bosniak army member for alleged war crimes against civilians.
Though his identity is a secret for now, prosecutors say he was charged in connection with the illegal detention and murder of four Serbs in the Kladanj municipality in 1992.
Separately Tuesday, police in Republika Srpska forwarded to BiH prosecutors items confiscated during a search Monday of the NLB Razvojna Banka premises in Banja Luka and the house of the bank's head, Radovan Bajic.
He is a suspected aide to war crimes fugitive indictee Stojan Zupljanin.

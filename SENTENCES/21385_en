THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Proceedings in Croatia's genocide lawsuit against Serbia began on Monday (May 26th) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. 
Croatia wants compensation from Serbia and Montenegro for the human toll and material damage suffered during the 1991-1995 conflicts among the former Yugoslav republics. 
Croatia says the Serbian army killed more than 20,000 Croats in ethnic cleansing campaigns, something Serbian lawyers reject. 
Serbia also says the ICJ has no jurisdiction because it was not a member of the UN when the suit was filed.

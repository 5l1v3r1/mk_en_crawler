BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic and Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic issued a joint statement Friday (10 June), condemning atrocities by members of the Scorpions paramilitary unit during the BiH war. 
The statement was released after a meeting between Cavic and Matijasevic, who discussed the recently broadcast tape showing the 1995 executions of six Srebrenica Bosniaks. 
Cavic stressed that RS institutions should establish the truth, even if it is difficult to accept.
Also Friday, the Sarajevo-based International Commission on Missing Persons said the identification of over 2,000 Srebrenica victims has been completed. 
The commission also confirmed its commitment to resolving 6,000 remaining cases of missing persons from Srebrenica.

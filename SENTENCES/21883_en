BELGRADE, Serbia -- Local assemblies will be the highest authorities in the 25 municipalities in which Kosovo Serbs voted during Serbia's May 11th elections, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said on Monday (May 19th).
Expressing satisfaction with the staging of local elections in Kosovo, he said assemblies will be constituted as high levels of local government, which will later create the Executive Council.
"Now, there are local government representatives who are selected in a democratic and legal way," Samardzic said, adding that they will communicate with Belgrade, rather than UNMIK.
The UN mission is considering whether to extend the mandate of current mayors, or organise municipal elections in these areas, as the mandate of these mayors expires on June 15th.
In other news Monday, the Kosovo government adopted a law on public holidays, marking Independence Day -- February 17th -- as most important.
The bill envisions 11 state holidays including Constitution Day, New Year's, May 1st, Europe Day, and religious holidays.

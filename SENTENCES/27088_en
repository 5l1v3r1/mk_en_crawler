THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes prosecutors on Thursday (February 4th) opposed further delays in former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's trial.
The proceedings are set to resume on March 1st.
Karadzic now wants another postponement, insisting he hasn't had enough time to prepare his defence.
Prosecutors maintain the trial has been delayed from the very beginning because Karadzic was not ready.
They say any further delay would affect the scheduling of witnesses.
Karadzic's trial opened in October but was suspended almost immediately due to his refusal to attend the sessions.

TEL AVIV, Israel -- A Palestinian broke into the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv late Tuesday (August 17th) in an attempt to seek asylum.
The man, identified as Nadim Injaz of the West Bank, took two hostages who were later freed.
According to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Injaz stormed the UK Embassy in Tel Aviv in 2006 with similar demands.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmed Davutoglu says the man was carrying a knife, a can of petrol and a toy gun when he forced his way into the building.
Guards shot and wounded him before he retreated to an upper floor and freed his hostages, believed to be the consul-general and his wife.
The attacker, who was later arrested and taken to hospital, is said to have a history of mental illness.
He claims he used to work for Israeli intelligence and says they are persecuting him.

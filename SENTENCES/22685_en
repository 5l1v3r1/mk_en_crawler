NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will meet separately next week with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat before they decide whether to launch direct talks on reunifying Cyprus.
According to reports by both Greek and Turkish media Thursday (July 10th), Ban is expected to meet Christofias in Paris and Talat in Berlin as a symbolic gesture in support of reunification efforts.
The UN is also expected to finalise the appointment of former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer as new UN envoy to Cyprus.
During a meeting later this month, Christofias and Talat will again assess work by teams laying the groundwork for direct talks.

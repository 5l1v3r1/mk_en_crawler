SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbia extradited a former army soldier to Sarajevo on Tuesday (July 7th), where he is wanted for the execution of 23 Muslim civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Zoran Maric, former member of the Bosnian Serb army, was extradited based on an arrest warrant issued by authorities in Sarajevo.
The victims, including women and children, were taken from their villages near the town of Jajce and shot on September 10th 1992.
In other news Tuesday, a mass grave containing the remains of at least six people was unearthed in Koricanski Stijene.
They may have come from Prijedor and were murdered in August 1992.
At The Hague meanwhile, the UN tribunal on Wednesday rejected former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's argument that he should not be prosecuted because of an alleged immunity deal he says he struck years ago with former US envoy Richard Holbrooke.
The court said even if there was a deal, it would lack legal standing, and Karadzic's trial should proceed.
In Serbia meanwhile, two military personnel were killed when their MIG-29 crashed near the Batajnica airport.
A third soldier was injured during the routine flight.

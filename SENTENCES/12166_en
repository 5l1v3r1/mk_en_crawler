TIRANA, Albania -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, who is currently OSCE chairman-in-office, urged the political parties in Albania on Monday (11 April) to ensure transparent and fair parliamentary elections this summer.
During a daylong visit to Tirana, Rupel told local political leaders that the vote was of the utmost importance for Albania's future and democracy.
He added that the international community views this as a major test of political maturity and stability in light of efforts to join the EU and NATO.

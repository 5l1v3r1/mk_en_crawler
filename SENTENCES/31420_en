ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan assured EU Budget Commissioner Michaele Schreyer that the country is determined to fulfil EU political criteria.
On Thursday (24 April), Erdogan and Schreyer met to discuss EU financial assistance to Turkey.
Recently, the Union decided to disburse 1.05 billion euros worth of aid to Turkey between 2004 and 2006, a figure Erdogan wants increased.
In a related development, local media is quoting EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen as saying that Turkey could be admitted to the Union in 2011 or 2012.
He reportedly suggested membership negotiations could start in the second half of 2005.

SHANGHAI, China -- Turkish ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived Tuesday (14 January) in China for a four-day official visit aimed at boosting trade relations.
Accompanying him is a Turkish business delegation that is to seek ways of establishing bilateral projects with Chinese companies.
The delegation attended a business forum in Shanghai, China's commercial capital.
Erdogan also met with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and the new leader, Hu Jintao.
Turkish-Chinese trade was estimated at $1.4 billion in 2002, an amount Erdogan hopes to double this year.
In Ankara meanwhile, Kurdish activists are demanding that the government improve prison conditions for Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Labour Party.
Sentenced to death in 1999, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2002 after Turkey banned the death penalty.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's parliamentary parties met on Monday (April 2nd), but failed to agree on resuming the legislature's constituent session, interrupted on February 14th.
The consultations were held at the request of the Democratic Party (DS) and were aimed at electing a permanent Assembly chairman, as well as authorising interim budget financing.
Parties in the Serbian democratic bloc have been trying to strike a deal on a new government since the January 21st parliamentary elections.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Ivo Miro Jovic, a Croat, took over the rotating chairmanship of the BiH presidency on Tuesday (28 June), succeeding Serb member Borislav Paravac. 
Following the formal ceremony, Jovic vowed to continue efforts to reform the defence system and said the current deadlock in restructuring the police sector is only temporary. 
Jovic was appointed to the tripartite presidency last month, after Dragan Covic was charged with embezzlement.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Two partners in the ruling coalition, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), on Wednesday (January 21st) teamed up to turn down an initiative by the third partner, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV). 
The party wanted to initiate constitutional amendments so that elections for the European Parliament and the Bulgarian parliament would occur on the same day. 
The NDSV argues that combining them in June could lead to substantial savings. 
Both the BSP and the MRF say the NDSV's motives are more political in nature. 
They insist the elections should be separate, as they address separate issues.
Also Wednesday, the BSP and the MRF signed an agreement to eradicate vote buying during elections. 
A coalition of NGOs, monitoring elections in the country, launched the initiative.

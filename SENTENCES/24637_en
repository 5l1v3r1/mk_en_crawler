BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 60,000 public workers launched a warning strike Tuesday (May 5th), demanding more money and fewer political appointees in the public sector.
One of the most powerful unions in the sector, the Sed Lex Alliance, organised the stoppage.
The union asked the cabinet to cancel a provision that allows political parties to influence staffing decisions in key positions.
Strikers also want the cabinet to close the gap between the highest and the lowest salaries in the system by cutting maximum wages and increasing minimum ones.
Prime Minister Emil Boc and Labour Minister Marian Sarbu are negotiating with union representatives on a proposed single-wage bill.
In other news, EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the European Commission will launch what is known as an excessive deficit procedure against Romania, as the country's budget deficit exceeds the threshold of 3% of GDP, media reported on Tuesday.
One main reason is Romania's high level of spending in the public sector.

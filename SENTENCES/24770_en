SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior, health and defence ministries, Sofia airport authorities, State National Security Agency (DANS) and civil defence service held an anti-terrorism exercise Tuesday (December 2nd) at the airport, local media reported on Wednesday.
The Silver Bird exercise was the first to involve a "hijacked" airplane.
The plot included three armed hypothetical terrorists who seized the plane and took 23 people onboard hostage, demanding additional fuel to fly over the Mediterranean Sea and a 40m-euro ransom.
The drill ended with the arrest of the three "hijackers" and the release of all 23 passengers.

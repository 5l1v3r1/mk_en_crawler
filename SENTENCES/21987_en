PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Authorities do not intend to hold a referendum on the recognition of Kosovo's independence, Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic said on Monday (October 20th).
"There has never been a case of somebody organising a referendum in his own country for political reasons related to another country," Krivokapic said.
Last week, the acting head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Amfilohije Radovic, said war in the region is inevitable following Kosovo's independence and due to the conditions faced by the Serb minority in Kosovo.
In other news Monday, the International Civilian Office in Kosovo identified top priorities over the next six months to move the new country closer to EU accession.
The three main policy areas are decentralisation, rule of law and security reforms.

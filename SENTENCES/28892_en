LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Borut Pahor on Friday (May 7th) called on Slovenians to support their country's arbitration border agreement with Croatia at a referendum on June 6th. 
Speaking on the first day of a campaign ahead of the vote, Pahor said that the deal would improve relations with Zagreb, guarantee Slovenian national interests and contribute to the region's stabilisation. 
He rejected opposition allegations that the deal -- which would settle the two countries' maritime border dispute via arbitration -- was struck under international pressure. 
The Slovenian government is obligated to comply with the referendum results.

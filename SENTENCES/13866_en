BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Serbian factory will manufacture arms for the US firm Remington next year, international media reported Tuesday (18 October).
Zastava Arms has been contracted to produce 24,000 carbines and small-calibre sporting rifles to be sold under the name "Remington-Zastava".
The Kragujevac-based firm also produces cars and recently signed a deal to manufacture vehicles for Fiat.

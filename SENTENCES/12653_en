SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown announced on Friday (4 March) that his office would review administrative measures taken against BiH officials since 1998, a move which could result in the revision of sanctions. 
At a news conference in Sarajevo, Ashdown said he had introduced the idea to the major international players about a year ago. 
He stressed that decisions would be made only after careful reviews of individual cases. 
An estimated 150 officials have been sanctioned so far.

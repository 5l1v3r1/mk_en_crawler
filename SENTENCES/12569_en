BUCHAREST, Romania -- Some 30,000 railway workers launched a weeklong strike Wednesday (8 June), demanding a 10 per cent salary increase, better working conditions and employment guarantees. 
Three of the four trade unions in the sector support the strike. 
By law, unions must keep one third of the trains operating.

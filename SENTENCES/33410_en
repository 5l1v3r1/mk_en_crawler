SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Macedonia reached 5,548 as of 28 May, according to data submitted to the government on Monday (2 June). 
About 3,942 are sheltered by families; the rest live in 16 centres in Kumanovo and Skopje. 
The government is reviewing the progress of the reconstruction of houses belonging to IDPs and damaged in the 2001 military conflict. 
Government spokesperson Saso Colakovski said 6,590 buildings were partly or fully damaged in the crisis areas. 
The European Commission and the International Management Group are helping with the reconstruction project, which has already entered its second phase. 
According to the government, the major obstacles are the continuing demolition of already reconstructed houses and a preference among IDPs to sell their property in the crisis areas. 
The government agreed it should aim to improve security and step up confidence in police and local authorities in order to convince IDPs to return to their homes.

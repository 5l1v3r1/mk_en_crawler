PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and Interpol President Khoo Boon Hui opened the 39th European Regional Conference of the international police organisation Wednesday (May 26th) in the town of Budva.
The main topic is fighting cross-border crime, which Djukanovic noted requires a united response.
He stressed that EU and NATO accession are important in fighting crime.
The Interpol chief called for global co-operation against threats.
"Just as criminals and terrorists constantly change their tactics, the forces of law and order have to work together and keep raising our game," he said.
About 125 delegates from 48 countries are participating in the conference.

ANKARA, Turkey -- European Commission President Romano Prodi said Monday (12 January) that he hopes the new government in Northern Cyprus improves chances for an agreement on the re-unification of the island. 
Prodi noted that while resolving the Cyprus issue is not a pre-condition to launching EU accession negotiations with Turkey, such a development would bolster relations.

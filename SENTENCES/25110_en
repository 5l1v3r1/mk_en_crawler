BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have detained Radisav Rodic, owner of the Belgrade-based Glas Javnosti daily and the Kurir tabloid, and Slavoljub Kacarevic, Glas Javnosti's editor-in-chief from 1999 to 2004.
In a statement released Wednesday (October 28th), prosecutors said the two are suspected of abusing their positions for personal benefit.
The editorial boards of their newspapers, however, claim the arrests are politically motivated and stem from critical articles about some corruption cases.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian court has sentenced Momcilo Mandic, who once served as a cabinet minister under Radovan Karadzic, to nine years in prison for abuse of power and counterfeiting documents.
However, Mandic was found not guilty of involvement in organised crime and of helping Karadzic evade justice.
The judges agreed with prosecutors that the defendant had defrauded Privredna Banka by transferring funds to political accounts and providing loans without collateral.
He was ordered to pay the equivalent of nearly $3m in compensation.
Another defendant, Republika Srpska businessman Milorad Govedarica, was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison.
Two others were acquitted:
former BiH presidency Serb member Mirko Sarovic and BiH businessman Milovan Bjelica.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Parliament's House of Peoples endorsed amendments Wednesday (16 November) to the law on citizenship.
These envision revising all decisions to grant citizenship to foreigners since 6 April 1992.
The changes, passed by the House of Representatives last week, provide for the establishment of a special commission, in charge of the process.
The panel would spend the next six months reviewing all cases of naturalised citizens who came from states other than the former Yugoslavia.

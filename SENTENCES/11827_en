THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch military officer was the first witness to testify in the civil suit brought against the Dutch government by two families of victims of the Srebrenica massacre. 
Berend Oosterveen, who took the stand on Wednesday (18 May), said the Dutch peacekeepers were unprepared for a Serb offensive on the Muslim enclave. 
The families are asking for $2.6 billion in an out-of-court settlement.
Also Wednesday, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos denied Bosnian Serb claims that the perpetrators of the 11 March 2004 terror attack in Madrid were trained in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
His statement came in response to a statement by Republika Srpska Police Chief Dragomir Andan, who said the bombers were linked to a network of foreign Islamic fighters who fought in the BiH conflict.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During a visit to Banja Luka on Wednesday (2 March), High Representative Paddy Ashdown reiterated that the end of April is the deadline for politicians to agree on crucial police reforms. 
He met with new Republika Srpska Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic and other officials. 
Restructuring the police sector is one of the main conditions for BiH's EU integration.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, Ashdown's office called on Dragan Covic to step down as the BiH presidency's Croat member. 
Prosecutors are charging him with embezzlement and abuse of office in connection with a large tax exemption granted in 2000, while he was serving as Federation of BiH finance minister.

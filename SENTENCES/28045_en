SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Council of Ministers adopted a rule book Thursday (August 19th) on the organisation of the directorate for the co-ordination of police bodies of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the remaining conditions for visa liberalisation.
High Representative Valentin Inzko, head of the EU Police Mission to BiH, Stefan Feller, and ChargÃ© dâAffaires of the EU delegation to BiH, Boris Iarochevitch, welcomed the move.
One remaining issue is the appointment of the director of the Agency for the Prevention of Corruption and the Co-ordination of the Fight against Corruption.
The clock is ticking, as the European Commission will finalise its report on BiH's progress in these areas on August 31st.

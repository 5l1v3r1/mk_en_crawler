COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- EU President and Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said Wednesday (4 December) that the outcome of the Serbian presidential election this weekend is essential to the country's bid for European integration.
He also urged voters to go to the polls, amid concerns that a turnout lower than 50 per cent will make the results invalid.
The vote will be Serbia's third attempt to elect a president.
Meanwhile, the federal parliament on Wednesday established a European integration committee that is to harmonise Yugoslav laws with European legislation.
In addition, the panel will help the country meet conditions for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement for EU accession.

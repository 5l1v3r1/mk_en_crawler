NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Celebrating Mass in Nicosia on Sunday (June 6th), Pope Benedict XVI appealed for "an urgent and concerted international effort to resolve the ongoing tensions in the Middle East, especially in the Holy Land, before such conflicts lead to greater bloodshed".
In the crowd at Eleftheria Stadium were patriarchs and bishops from the Middle East, President Demetris Christofias, Archbishop Chrysostomos II and other Cypriot religious and political leaders.
Shortly before the service, a crowd of around 100 Orthodox Christians staged a peaceful protest against Benedict's visit to Cyprus.

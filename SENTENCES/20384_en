ATHENS, Greece -- The coast guard arrested 160 illegal immigrants at the weekend, most of them in boats on the Aegean, while others were found on the islands of Lesbos, Leros, Chios and Samos. 
The immigrants, Afghan nationals and Palestinians, will be kept in detention until their cases are reviewed by immigration authorities. 
They are among the thousands of Asians who try to enter Greece by sea. 
Police said that a man suspected of organising the human trafficking ring was detained as well.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- The defence team representing former BiH presidency member Ejup Ganic accused Serbia on Friday (June 11th) of violating international law by trying to persuade UK authorities to extradite their client. 
Ganic was arrested on March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade. 
Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead. 
Ganic has denied the charges. 
His lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, told a London court on Friday that in order for the extradition rules to apply, Serbia must demonstrate that the alleged crime occurred in fighting between two states involved in an international armed conflict. 
Serbia has argued in other international court hearings that the Bosnian conflict was not a war between two states but rather a civil struggle between domestic ethnic forces.

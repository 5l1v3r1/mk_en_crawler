BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's foreign affairs committee approved EU progress reports for Croatia and Macedonia on Wednesday (February 27th).
The documents will now be subject to a vote by the full European Parliament in Strasbourg in April.
The report on Croatia, by EP Rapporteur Hannes Swoboda of Austria, underscores the need to quickly resolve remaining border and ecological zone problems that have put Zagreb at odds with EU members Slovenia and Italy.
Croatia was also urged to speed up development of its administrative capacity and strengthen its judiciary.
The report on Macedonia, drafted by Dutch European Parliament Member and EP Rapporteur Eric Meyer, praised the country's efforts to improve relations among various ethnic groups, but noted "continuing discrimination against the Roma community".

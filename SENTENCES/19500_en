ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS), the main Serb political party in Croatia, announced on Wednesday (March 26th) that its representative in the government, Slobodan Uzelac, will remain at his post.
"Any other decision would be harmful to our people," SDSS leader Vojislav Stanimirovic told journalists.
Uzelac resigned on March 19th to protest Zagreb's decision to recognise Kosovo's independence, but Prime Minister Ivo Sanader refused to accept his resignation.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors from the Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) have launched an investigation against Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu, the Gandul newspaper reported on Saturday (April 26th).
Nicolaescu is expected to undergo questioning immediately after the Easter holidays for suspected abuse of office.
At issue is his involvement on the board of the Romanian Lottery during the time he served as a deputy state secretary in the finance ministry.
Nicolaescu becomes the fifth member of the cabinet to undergo a corruption probe.
On Friday, DNA prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Cristian Boureanu, an MP from the Democratic Liberal Party, in connection with the same lottery issue.

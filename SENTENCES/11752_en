LONDON, Britain -- The 19 June edition of London's The Sunday Times carried a story suggesting that former Republika Srpska (RS) military commander Ratko Mladic -- one of the UN tribunal's most-wanted men -- has struck a deal under which he would surrender to authorities in exchange for $5m in compensation. 
Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper reported that Mladic would turn himself in before the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre on 11 July. 
The same sources said the deal was being brokered through powerful oligarchs who were also involved in past surrenders of war crimes indictees. 
Serbian authorities, who have consistently denied they were negotiating with Mladic, have rejected this latest report.
In other news, Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic has called for a mutual apology by Bosnia and Herzegovina's three main ethnic groups for crimes committed during the war. 
During a TV interview Saturday, Cavic said a great number of people had suffered and that a sincere but simultaneous apology is needed.

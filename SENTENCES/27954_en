PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government has received an official invitation to attend the EU-Western Balkans conference in Sarajevo next month, Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Tuesday (May 18th). 
Kosovo will be on equal footing with other participating countries, with an equal right to express its opinion on regional developments and European integration, Kuci added. 
UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier is also expected to attend the meeting, though will not speak for Pristina institutions. 
The conference, sponsored by Spain as president of the EU, is expected to be held without state symbols. 
If successful, it will host delegations from both Pristina and Belgrade for the first time since Kosovo declared independence in February 2008.

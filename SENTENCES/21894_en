ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors are investigating former Defence Minister Berislav Roncevic and his then deputy Ivo Becic, in connection with the illegal purchase of 39 Italian trucks in 2004, according to media reports Friday (November 21st). 
President Stipe Mesic requested the probe, which is being conducted by the National Office for the Fight Against Corruption and Organised Crime. 
Roncevic and Becic allegedly ordered the trucks from the company Iveco, a division of Italy's Fiat, through Croatian dealer Europakamion.
In other news Friday, former General Vladimir Zagorec went on trial in Zagreb for embezzlement and abuse of office. 
Prosecutors say that when he stepped down from the post of deputy defence minister in 2000, he embezzled diamonds worth $5m which were left by a German trader in 1993 as a guarantee for a weapons deal. 
Zagorec pleaded not guilty to all charges. 
His lawyer is Zvonimir Hodak, whose 26-year-old daughter was gunned down in Zagreb last month, shortly after Zagorec's extradition from Austria.

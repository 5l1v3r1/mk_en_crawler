TIRANA, Albania - President Alfred Moisiu has vetoed the law on obligatory military service, sending the measure back to parliament.
In a statement issued Monday (19 May), his press office explained that Moisiu opposed the bill's exemptions from active or alternative military service.
Under the legislation, those who complete their higher education by Dec 31, 2005 would be freed of the obligation to serve in the army.
This, according to the president, violates the constitution, which says all citizens should be treated equally under the law.

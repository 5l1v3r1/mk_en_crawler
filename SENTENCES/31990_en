SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, imposed several new laws on Monday (21 October) that would make doing business in the country easier and would broaden his own powers in the appointment of ministers. 
The new laws would make it easier to set up companies and are intended to promote trade liberalisation. 
Ashdown called the laws a "major step towards creating a single economic space in Bosnia." He also granted himself the power to veto the appointment of the ministers of foreign trade and economic relations, finance, education, and refugees. 
This policy had previously been applied only to the ministers of interior, justice, and defence. 
Ashdown said he would make sure that appointees do not have war crimes, obstruction of peace or mismanagement on their records.
Also Monday, Ashdown validated the government amendments to the new law on ministries. 
According to the law, the Federation of BiH will have 16 ministries, one prime minister and two deputy prime ministers. 
The deputy minister position is abolished. 
Eight ministerial positions will be held by Bosniaks, five by Bosnian Croats and three by Bosnian Serbs - proportions in accordance with the 1991 census.

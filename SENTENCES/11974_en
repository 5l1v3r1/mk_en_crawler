ANKARA, Turkey -- The government plans to adopt urgently needed legislation for reform of the banking and social security systems, Economy Minister Ali Babacan said Wednesday (15 June). 
Lawmakers are expected to vote on the reform package before their summer recess at the end of June. 
The IMF has set the adoption of this legislation as a condition for the release of $800m in new loans. 
The Fund has also encouraged Turkey to adopt tax reforms in the autumn that would improve collection and allow for future tax cuts.

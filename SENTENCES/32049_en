SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of NATO, the EU, the United States and the OSCE joined together Tuesday (19 November) in urging Macedonia to fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
They warned that any hesitation or delay in the transfer of five cases related to alleged war crimes could result in being reported to the UN Security Council for noncompliance.
The tribunal decided in October to take over jurisdiction of the cases, which are connected to last year's conflict.
Four involve the killings of Macedonian police and soldiers, while the fifth involves allegations that government troops killed ten ethnic Albanians during the siege of a village.

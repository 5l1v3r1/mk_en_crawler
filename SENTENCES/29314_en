ANKARA, Turkey -- A key meeting of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) wraps up Wednesday (August 4th) after four days of closed-door discussions on army promotions and dismissals.
Military officials were quoted as saying last week that the army has decided to promote 11 generals and admirals charged with involvement in plans to topple the government.
The men are part of a group of 102 retired and active duty officers who were issued arrest warrants in relation to the alleged coup plot.
A decision on the promotions is expected to be made public soon and be submitted to President Abdullah Gul for ratification.
The new appointments will enter into force after their promulgation in the official paper expected on September 1st.
In other news, one soldier was killed and two others were injured in an armed attack in the Ordu region in northern Turkey on Tuesday.
Local media said terrorists of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) were behind the attack.
The troops were patrolling an area between the towns of Akkus and Salman, when assailants opened fire against them from a car.
The attackers managed to escape.

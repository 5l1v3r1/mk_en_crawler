BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase completed his cabinet reshuffle Monday (8 March) by appointing three "superministers" to speed up EU accession. 
Economy Minister Dan Ioan Popescu will get broader powers for managing the economy, Interior Minister Ion Rus will be in charge of all social and administrative questions, and Ioan Talpes, the presidential counselor for internal security, will oversee European integration, justice and defence. 
Speranta Maria Ianculescu will head the new environment ministry. 
Nastase sacked Justice Minister Rodica Stanoiu because of delays in the reform of the judiciary, replacing her with Cristian Diaconescu. 
Victor Ponta will oversee Romania's adoption of 80,000 pages of EU rules and regulations by 2007.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic urged Kosovo Albanian leaders Sunday (13 August) to fight extremism and ensure the protection of the Serb minority in the province.
His comment coincided with the 3rd anniversary of an attack on Serbian children in Gorazdevac, which claimed two lives and wounded four other youngsters.
He again urged the international community in Kosovo to find those responsible for the crime, as well as others targeting ethnic Serbs.

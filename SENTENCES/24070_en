SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said on Thursday (April 16th) he believes the Council of Ministers needs a restructuring for the sake of the government that emerges from the 2010 election.
Speaking after the presentation of a report to parliament on government achievements in 2008, Spiric stressed that any restructuring requires political consensus and that he cannot initiate or do it on his own.
He noted that the last time he tried to do this, detractors accused him of provoking a crisis.
Spiric stepped down in November 2007 to express disagreement with an Office of the High Representative decision to amend the government and parliament's decision-making process.
After lengthy negotiations, the main parties convinced him to keep his seat to avoid early elections.

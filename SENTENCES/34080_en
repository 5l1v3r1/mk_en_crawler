SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR announced on Tuesday (22 July) that it has held the first joint training programme for Bosnian Serb, Muslim and Croat military officers.
In all, 165 members of the armed services from the two entities attended classes together in Mostar earlier this month.
The international community has insisted that BiH merge its armies into a single force under central government control.
In other news, the International Crisis Group (ICG) has published a report saying nationalist leaders are delaying reforms in BiH.
The ICG estimates it might be two or three years before the international community could return control of the country to local leaders.
In Banja Luka on Tuesday, Republika Srpska Parliamentary Chairman Dragan Kalinic discussed legislative adjustments needed before the two entities can sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Around 900 laws in BiH and the two entities must be harmonised with EU standards.

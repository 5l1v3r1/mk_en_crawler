BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than 200 police officers and public servants staged a joint protest in Bucharest on Saturday (November 22nd), demanding better pay and increased personnel. 
Police officers want a 30% salary hike, more personnel, bonuses and implementation of several amendments to the police officers' statute. 
The public servants' trade union wants the government to resume negotiations in 2009 on salary increases.
In other news Friday, a committee of Spain's lower house of parliament rejected a proposal to lift labour market restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian workers, media reported. 
Last week, the European Commission encouraged member states to open their labour markets to Romanians and Bulgarians as soon as possible. 
In a report, the EU said workers from the new member states did not cause "serious disturbances" to labour markets in other member countries.

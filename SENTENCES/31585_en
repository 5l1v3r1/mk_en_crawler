TIRANA, Albania -- Launching negotiations on an Association and Stabilisation Agreement with the EU was one of the most significant events in the history of Albanian foreign relations, says Foreign Minister Ilir Meta.
On Saturday (18 January), he presented an annual analysis of ministry activities, saying "negotiations are a testimony to the quality of interior developments, reforms and concrete progress towards concluding the transitional period." Focusing on 2003 foreign relations strategy, Meta stated that his country would continue to pay "the same attention to relations with the United States, which is a strategic ally for the stability, security and development of Southeast Europe."

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo Prime Minister-designate Hashim Thaci vowed in an interview Saturday (December 15th) that he would convince the Serb minority to stay in Kosovo even if the province becomes independent. 
"They have seats in parliament; they will be part of my government; I will work with them; their security and property are guaranteed; I will convince them to stay," Thaci told the Bulgarian newspaper Trud. 
He also insisted that Kosovo's independence is only "a matter of weeks away" and said a declaration of independence would be co-ordinated with the EU and the United States.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The New Serbia party on Sunday (28 September) nominated leader Velimir Ilic as its candidate in November's presidential election. 
The move follows last week's nomination, by the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, of Democratic Centre leader Dragoljub Micunovic as its candidate. 
"I expect the election to be successful and to beat the DOS candidate," said Ilic. 
He added that he would work to ensure that early parliamentary elections are called as soon as possible.

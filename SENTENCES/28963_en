BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic discussed the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo with visiting US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, media reported on Thursday (April 8th).
Tadic reportedly told Steinberg that Belgrade will never recognise Kosovo, but that Serbia remains committed to the idea of continuing talks "to find a compromise solution which does not imply that one side wins and the other loses".
The two officials also discussed the latest developments in BiH, with Tadic reiterating that Serbia will never allow the division of BiH since that would jeopardise regional stability.
In an interview with Tanjug news agency Thursday, Steinberg said Washington considers Serbia a key partner in the region.
He said that his visit to the Balkans was aimed to convey a message of support for leaders in the region in building a common European future.
Steinberg also praised the declaration recently passed by the Serbian parliament condemning 1995 crimes committed in Srebrenica.
From Belgrade, Steinberg travelled to Pristina, where he urged Kosovo and Serbian leaders to co-operate on practical issues, setting aside differences on Kosovo's status.
He also called for more efforts to fight corruption and crime.
In Pristina, Steinberg met with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, President Fatmir Sejdiu and leaders of three new Serb-dominated municipalities.

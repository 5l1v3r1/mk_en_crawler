OHRID, Macedonia -- A week-long seminar on controlling the sale and trafficking of small and light weapons opened on Monday (November 13th) in Ohrid. 
Participants agreed on the need to organise new campaigns to collect illegal weapons. 
They estimate some 165,000 light weapons left over from the 2001 conflict are still at large.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said Wednesday (25 June) that it is still too early to talk about signing an agreement on the non-extradition of US citizens to the International Criminal Court. 
He added that talks with US experts would continue. 
Recently, federal government officials talked about a time-limited agreement that would depend on the country's progress towards EU accession.
Macedonia reportedly will sign the bilateral agreement with the United States, according to A1 TV. 
Sources say the cabinet is expected to adopt the decision at a closed-door session Thursday.

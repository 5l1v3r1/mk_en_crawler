THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) refused on Monday (9 May) to grant the provisional release of former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj before his trial begins in The Hague. 
Prosecutors reportedly cited insufficient guarantees by UNMIK. 
The former Kosovo Liberation Army commander is charged with crimes against Serbs and non-Albanians during the Kosovo conflict. 
He surrendered to the ICTY in March.
In other news, it appears the tribunal wants to expand the indictment against two Croat generals, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, who are charged with 1995 crimes against ethnic Serbs. 
A lawyer for Markac, Miroslav Separovic, said Monday that prosecutors have proposed an amended indictment, which includes members of the Croatian cabinet, the ruling Croatian Democratic Union party, the army, and the police.

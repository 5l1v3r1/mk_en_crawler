VIENNA, Austria -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Kosovo Ulrike Lunacek believes that Kosovo needs a clear membership perspective, rather than promises regarding its EU future. 
Lunacek presented a document in Vienna on Tuesday (June 1st) containing eight recommendations, drafted with experts and representatives of Kosovo's civil society. 
"I am working on a report which should be discussed in the EP in July," she said, adding it will be delivered to officials in Brussels as well. 
The document urges the EU to set concrete tasks for Kosovo, such as a "visa roadmap". 
Lunacek also reiterated her position that EU member states must make clear to Serbia that it won't be able to join the EU without recognising Kosovo.

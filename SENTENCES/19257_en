BELGRADE, Serbia -- The US Embassy in Belgrade re-opened on Wednesday (February 27th) after six days of repairing damage caused by demonstrators angry over US support for Kosovo's independence.
In a statement Wednesday, the embassy noted that its consulate department will remain closed for an unspecified period of time due to security concerns and ongoing repairs.
Visa applications submitted by Serbian citizens will be reviewed by the US Embassy in Zagreb until further notice.

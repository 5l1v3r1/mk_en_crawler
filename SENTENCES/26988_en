SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday (November 4th) that the Council of Ministers will urge President Georgi Parvanov to dismiss Bulgaria's Ambassador to the United States, Lachezar Petkov, and the ambassador to Turkey, Branimir Mladenov. 
At issue is a probe into voting irregularities during the July 5th general elections. 
Prosecutors began investigating last month amid suspicions that voters holding dual Bulgarian and Turkish citizenship voted twice, while those who never turned out at polling stations in Turkey were counted as having cast their ballots. 
Most of the votes in Turkey were in support of the Turkish minority party Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which won 38 seats in Bulgaria's 240-seat parliament.

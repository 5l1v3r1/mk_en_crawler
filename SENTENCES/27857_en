MADRID, Spain -- War crimes suspect Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "Monster of Grbavica", told a Spanish Court on Friday (April 23rd) he wants to be extradited to Montenegro, rather than to Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia. 
All three countries have requested his extradition. 
Vlahovic, who was born in Montenegro, was arrested in Spain in early March on suspicion of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. 
He is accused of the murder, rape and torture of non-Serbs while a member of a paramilitary unit, from 1992 to 1993.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Savo Todovic, the wartime deputy commander of the infamous Foca prison camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina, appeared before the UN tribunal on Wednesday (19 January) to hear his indictment. 
It includes 18 counts of crimes against humanity, violations of the laws or customs of war and breaches of the Geneva Conventions. 
The commander of the same camp, Milorad Krnojelac, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
Todovic surrendered to the Bosnian Serb authorities Saturday and was immediately extradited to The Hague.
In other news, former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving an 11-year sentence for war crimes in Sweden, has denounced Radovan Karadzic in the first volume of her memoirs. 
The book paints a dark picture of the Bosnian Serb leader as someone who profited from the war and enjoyed extravagance and luxury while thousands were dying.

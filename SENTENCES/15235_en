PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The submission of candidates' lists for the parliamentary and local elections, due to be held simultaneously on 10 September, was due to begin on Monday (31 July), according to the main election commission. 
The deadline for parties and coalitions to submit their lists is 16 August.
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said on Friday that no funds from the state budget are available to finance campaigns. 
All such money was spent during the May referendum on independence, he noted.

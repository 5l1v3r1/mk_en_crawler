VIENNA, Austria -- Martti Ahtisaari, the chief UN mediator in the Kosovo status talks, confirmed on Friday (November 10th) that he would postpone announcing his blueprint for the future of the province until after the January 21st parliamentary elections in Serbia.
He said he made his decision after talks with representatives of the international Contact Group, which includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.
Reactions were mixed.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said he was worried by the delay, but expressed hope the process would eventually lead to an independent state.
Hashim Thaci, one of the province's top political figures, did not appear to be concerned.
"Kosovo was never betrayed by the West," he said.
"We liberated Kosovo together with the international community and we will declare independence when we all agree."
In Belgrade, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica criticised Ahtisaari's move, saying the Kosovo status issue and Serbia's elections were two completely different processes.
However, the Serbian government's co-ordinator for Kosovo, Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, said the postponement was an encouraging sign and could provide an opportunity for resuming direct status talks.
In other news, the commander of the 2,000 French troops in Kosovo, General Marc Duquesne, urged Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and Serbs to put the past behind them.
He said they should follow the example of the reconciliation between France and Germany after World War II, which paved the way for today's united Europe.
The general was speaking at a ceremony marking the 88th anniversary of the armistice which ended World War I. (Danas, Tanjug, The New York Times, Reuters, Xinhua, AFP - 11/11/06;

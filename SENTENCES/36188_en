SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The documents required to register a new group in the Bulgarian legislature were submitted Tuesday (9 March). 
The group, called New Time, was formed by members who split from the ruling National Movement Simeon II (NDSV). 
The new party's whip is Miroslav Sevlievski, the former deputy whip of NDSV. 
New Time members are younger, more reform-oriented individuals who were at odds with the more conservative forces in the Simeon movement.
In other news Monday, officials announced that an electrical short circuit was the cause of the weekend fire at the government building in Sofia. 
Arson and human error have been ruled out. 
Two dozen people had been questioned, including a deputy prime minister.

TIRANA, Albania -- Ombudsman Ermir Dobjani has asked parliament to revise some provisions of the law on the organisation and work of the judiciary.
His office says Dobjani sent a letter last week to Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli, calling for the reconsideration of texts that regulate the appointment of district court and appeals chambers' chairpersons.
Dobjani says the current provision providing for limitless mandates of court chairpersons often leads to lifetime appointments and discourages well-qualified judges from seeking promotions.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Thursday (March 29th) to support the plan for Kosovo's final status drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
The European lawmakers said in a report that "supervised sovereignty" was "the only sustainable settlement for Kosovo".
They noted, however, that an international presence is needed to maintain Kosovo's multiethnic character.
The report also pointed out that the EU mission that would take over from UNMIK should not create a parallel government in Pristina.
In his address to Parliament, EU security chief Javier Solana said this would be the most important mission the Union has ever undertaken.
He also noted that relations with Serbian President Boris Tadic are good."We need to support him so that the new government can be a pro-European one, which can bring Serbia towards its destiny of a European perspective," Solana said.

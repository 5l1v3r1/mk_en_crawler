ANKARA, Turkey -- Terrorists from the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) radical group claimed responsibility Saturday (August 23rd) for two terrorist attacks in Turkey last week. 
The group, believed to be linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), said in a statement on its website that the attacks were in response to Ankara's attitude towards the Kurdish population. 
On Tuesday, 13 police officers were injured in an explosion in the southern city of Mersin. 
On Thursday, 16 people were injured in a bomb attack in Izmir. 
Police arrested eight people Saturday in connection with it.

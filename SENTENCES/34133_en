BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Belgrade must arrest top Bosnian Serb war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic if he is in the country and drop a lawsuit against NATO if it wants to upgrade ties, an Alliance official said. 
Last month, Belgrade requested admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme -- four years after the Alliance's campaign to end Slobodan Milosevic's repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. 
But George Katsirdakis, NATO's acting director for defence partnership and co-operation, said the country must resolve two outstanding problems before joining the PfP. 
"The case against NATO before the International Court of Justice must be lifted and Belgrade must resolve the war crimes tribunal related issue concerning Mladic," he told Reuters.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Some 3,000 supporters rallied on Thursday (April 19th) in the centre of Bucharest to protest Parliament's decision to suspend President Traian Basescu. 
Lawmakers impeached Basescu by a comfortable margin, accusing him of acting unconstitutionally. 
Addressing the crowd, Basescu denied the charges and insisted there is no evidence to support them. 
By law, his future will be decided by a nationwide referendum on impeachment, to be held within 30 days. 
He has instead indicated he will resign and force snap elections, which polls suggest he would easily win.

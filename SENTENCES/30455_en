SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Rosatom emphasised on Wednesday (March 16th) that it will seek compensation unless Bulgaria signs an important annex for the Belene nuclear power plant project by the end of this month.
"If the nuclear plant construction agreement...
is not signed, Rosatom will have no legal grounds to continue working on the project," Kiril Komarov, chief of the company's nuclear energy unit, told reporters in Sofia.
"If Bulgaria rejects the agreement, Rosatom will seek compensations envisaged in the initial contract," he warned.
Bulgaria and Atomstroyexport, a subsidiary of Rosatom, signed an agreement to build the plant for an initial price of 4 billion euros.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt told reporters Monday (8 March) that Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak will surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal by the end of the week. 
The two retired generals have been indicted for what prosecutors described as the "deportation and/or displacement of tens of thousands of Krajina Serbs" during a military operation in 1995. 
They are also accused of participating in a "joint criminal enterprise" with General Ante Gotovina and the late President Franjo Tudjman. 
Skare-Ozbolt said the government hopes the defendants would be granted provisional release pending trial. 
Croatian President Stipe Mesic says he is ready to testify in defence of Cermak. 
Gotovina remains at large.

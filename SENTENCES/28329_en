TIRANA, Albania -- Police authorities in Tirana asked the opposition Socialist Party (SP) on Thursday (May 13th) to stop blocking the main boulevard and return the traffic flow to normal. 
In a letter to SP leader Edi Rama, who also is mayor of Tirana, city police head Tonin Vocaj expressed concern over big backups at intersections stemming from the protests. 
He also said SP supporters are holding unauthorised rallies, complicating efforts by police. 
Rama, meanwhile, is urging SP lawmakers and supporters to continue their hunger strikes in downtown Tirana until the government agrees to investigate the June 2009 general elections. 
All opposition parties have called for another "massive protest" on Friday.

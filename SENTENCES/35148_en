TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament's economic commission approved the bilateral free trade agreement with Serbia-Montenegro on Monday (23 February). 
Tirana already has signed seven such agreements with other countries. 
The provisions of the agreement with Serbia-Montenegro mainly concern trade in agricultural products, including fruits, vegetables and processed foods. 
Currently, trade with Serbia-Montenegro accounts for 2 per cent to 3 per cent of Albania's total foreign exchange. 
Before 1990, the former Yugoslavia was Albania's main economic partner.

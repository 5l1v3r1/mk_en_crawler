BUCHAREST, Romania -- Greece's delegation left a UNESCO conference on cultural heritage under way in Bucharest on Monday (September 22nd), citing two reasons related to its longstanding name dispute with Macedonia. 
First, the country was introduced at the conference by its constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia, which Greece does not recognise. 
Secondly, the delegation from Skopje distributed a book during the conference referring to the "Macedonian language".
Separately Monday, media reported that the UN envoy in the name dispute, Matthew Nimetz, will meet individually with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski in New York on Wednesday. 
This will be on the sidelines of the 63rd session of the UN General Assembly. 
Discussions are expected to focus on responses to Nimetz's latest package of proposals.

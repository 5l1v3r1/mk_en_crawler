BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic has reportedly voiced support for two road infrastructure projects proposed by Bulgaria. 
He says the motorway project connecting Nis to Sofia is a priority for Serbia. 
He added the new checkpoints to be opened on borders between Bulgaria, Serbia and Macedonia would strengthen the ties in the region. 
Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofiyanski initiated the idea, and discussed it with Zivkovic late Monday (14 April). 
Sofiyanski will pitch it to Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.

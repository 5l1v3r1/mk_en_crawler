THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic could take more than four years, judges at the UN war crimes tribunal warned on Friday (September 3rd).
The trial opened in October 2009 and was expected to end in December 2012.
But a new evaluation of the proceedings so far suggests the trial could stretch into 2014 if the prosecutors and defence do not speed up cross-examinations.
Judge O-Gon Kwon cited the unprecedented number of documents and witnesses in the case.
Karadzic faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
He is defending himself at his trial.

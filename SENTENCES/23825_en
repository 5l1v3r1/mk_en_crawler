ANKARA, Turkey -- Police detained at least a dozen suspected members of al-Qaeda in simultaneous raids in four provinces early on Tuesday (April 21st), media reported. 
They staged the raids in the southeastern provinces of Gaziantep and Sanliurfa, the central province of Konya and the southern city of Adana. 
Police raided the same district of Gaziantep, Karsiyaka, where four al-Qaeda members died in a shootout with police last year. 
Earlier this month, police arrested seven people for alleged links to the terror network in simultaneous operations in the western province of Eskisehir. 
In March, local media reported that Ankara has received US intelligence suggesting al-Qaeda militants could be plotting attacks on foreign targets in Turkey.
In other news, media reported on Monday a court in Istanbul has ordered the release of ten people detained for suspected links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Last week, police arrested 51 people in a series of raids against suspected PKK infiltration of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party and Kurdish NGOs.

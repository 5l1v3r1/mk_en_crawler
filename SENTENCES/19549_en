MOSCOW, Russia -- President Vladimir Putin has ordered his government to send humanitarian aid to the Serb minority in Kosovo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a cabinet meeting Monday (March 24th). 
He added Russia plans to help with food, medicine and medical equipment. 
Lavrov insisted the humanitarian situation among ethnic Serbs has deteriorated since Kosovo broke away from Serbia on February 17th. 
Russia is Serbia's staunchest ally in opposing Kosovo's independence and says it will never recognise the new state.

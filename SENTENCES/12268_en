ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic promised on Wednesday (12 January) to lead his country into the EU in 2008 if re-elected.
He voiced confidence that he would win Sunday's runoff against ruling party candidate Jadranka Kosor.
Mesic also pledged full co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Addressing the European Parliament on Wednesday, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, declared that future EU membership talks with Croatia would be a positive example for the rest of the region.

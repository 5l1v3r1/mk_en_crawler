SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown, warned Friday (25 March) that the Federation of BiH (FBiH) government was undermining BiH's international image and jeopardising around $140m in international assistance.
According to Ashdown, FBiH authorities are failing to meet obligations agreed on previously with international financial institutions.
Meanwhile, a report issued Friday by the FBiH Constitutional Court warns that constitutionality is not functioning adequately in the entity, both in terms of establishing a legislative framework and implementing laws.
The report cited frequent violations of the constitution by the entity and cantonal bodies, as well as failures to heed rulings by the BiH Constitutional Court.
Also on Friday, a BiH-Croatian interstate commission said it has finished verifying the 1999 bilateral border demarcation agreement.
With the process now complete, the document is ready for final ratification by the parliaments of the two countries.

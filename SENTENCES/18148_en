BERLIN, Germany -- During a speech to parliament on Thursday (December 14th) about the goals of Germany's EU presidency next year, Chancellor Angela Merkel said countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Macedonia have the prospect of EU membership, but in the medium term.
She added that "a great many preparations" would be needed before it becomes reality.
Merkel noted that the western Balkans would be a key issue in the next six months, mostly due to the upcoming Kosovo status decision.
Germany assumes the rotating EU presidency from Finland in January.

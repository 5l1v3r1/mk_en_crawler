THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Monday (16 February) that she is satisfied with the prosecution phase of Slobodan Milosevic's trial.
"We succeeded in showing Milosevic's responsibility," she said, acknowledging the difficulties prosecutors had encountered in proving the existence of a chain of command, particularly regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina.
She said prosecutors have decided not to ask former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic to testify against Milosevic in the last two days of the prosecution phase.
Plavsic was called to The Hague a few days ago, but has since been sent back to her prison cell in Sweden.

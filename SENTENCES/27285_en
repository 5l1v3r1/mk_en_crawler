BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic appeared at a Belgrade court Tuesday (December 1st) to respond to charges of drinking alcohol during a sports event in October. 
He admitted to taking a sip of champagne at a stadium following Serbia's 5-0 victory over Romania in a World Cup qualifier. 
"I did not know that consumption of alcohol, even if only for a toast, has been forbidden so I fully take responsibility for the violation" of the law, Tadic said. 
Sports Minister Snezana Markovic-Samardzic and the head of the football federation, Tomislav Karadzic, face charges as well.

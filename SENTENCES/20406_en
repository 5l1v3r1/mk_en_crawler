BELGRADE, Serbia -- The State Committee for Conflict of Interest announced on Friday (October 12th) that it is investigating Infrastructure Minister Velimir Ilic in connection with alleged actions while he was minister of capital investment in the previous government. 
The committee decided to open a case after several media reports that Ilic started the construction of a private hospital without obtaining the necessary permits for land he owns with his brother, Cacak Mayor Vojislav Ilic. 
Minister Ilic, who is also leader of the junior ruling coalition ally New Serbia, says he had obtained all necessary permits, but did not know he had to report the construction work to the committee.

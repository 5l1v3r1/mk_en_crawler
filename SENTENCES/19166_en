ZAGREB, Croatia -- Following the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ruling that cleared Serbia of genocide charges in BiH, a lawyer representing Croatia suggested on Wednesday (February 28th) that Zagreb might drop a similar lawsuit it filed before the ICJ in 1999. 
Croatia also approached the court, accusing the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then Serbia-Montenegro, of genocide, committed on Croatian territory during the 1991 conflict and of the organised killings of some 10,000 Croats. 
Lawyer Ivan Simonovic says he has become sceptical of the outcome however, in light of the recent ICJ ruling. 
He recommends that Croatia instead pursue an out-of-court settlement with Serbia.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said on Tuesday (March 15th) that his country stands firmly behind the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen zone. 
"Luxembourg will do everything possible so that Bulgaria and Romania become Schengen members in the next months," Asselborn told a joint press conference with Romanian counterpart Teodor Basonschi in Bucharest. 
Entry expected this month was delayed because Bulgaria failed to meet all seven requirements.

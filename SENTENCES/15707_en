ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and Turkey exchanged criticism Wednesday (24 May) over a midair collision between Turkish and Greek warplanes earlier this week. 
President Greek Karolos Papoulias said Turkey had behaved "unacceptably", while Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis warned that actions of this kind were incompatible with Turkey's aspirations for EU membership. 
The Turkish Air Force, meanwhile, issued a statement saying its planes were in Mediterranean airspace when they were confronted and "harassed" by two Greek F-16s. 
The Greek warplanes breached "the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the rules of engagement", the statement said.
In other news, Turkish authorities ruled out sabotage as a cause of Wednesday's devastating fire at the international airport in Istanbul. 
A Kurdish rebel group had claimed responsibility for the blaze, but it appears an electrical short circuit was probably to blame. 
Most of the airport's cargo area was destroyed, causing millions in damage, but no casualties.

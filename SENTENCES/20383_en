BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) will ask Croatia to complete accession negotiations by the end of October 2009, according to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso.
On Thursday (March 13th), he met with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to discuss the matter.
Under the new schedule, Croatia could open negotiations on all chapters of the acquis in the next few months, providing enough time to complete talks by late 2009 and possibly join the EU in 2010.
Barroso stressed that Croatia has overcome key hurdles, an apparent reference to a controversial fishing zone it established in the Adriatic.
Zagreb bowed to EU pressure this week and gave up on the zone for the time being.

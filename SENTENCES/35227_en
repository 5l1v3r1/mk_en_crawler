BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said Friday (23 April) that he would meet with former public security chief Sreten Lukic in an attempt to convince him to surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal.
He added that co-operation with the tribunal is a government priority and that he plans similar meetings with other former army and police officers who have been indicted for war crimes committed in Kosovo.
Jocic also said the Serbian police had no information on the whereabouts of former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic.

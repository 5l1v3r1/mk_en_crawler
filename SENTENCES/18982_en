BERLIN, Germany -- Kosovo's future is expected to be high on the agenda of the 33rd G8 summit, scheduled to run from Wednesday (June 6th) through Friday in the German resort of Heiligendamm. 
However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Der Spiegel Sunday that she did not expect any decisions to be made during the summit.
Meanwhile, the head of the Serbian government's press office, Srdjan Djuric, said that Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Russian President Vladimir Putin plan to meet in St Petersburg on June 9th. 
Talks are expected to focus on resuming the Kosovo status negotiation process, as called for by both Belgrade and Moscow.

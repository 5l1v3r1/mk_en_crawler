TIRANA, Albania -- The Republican Party (RP) is waiting for inclusion again in the government after being left out of the cabinet for more than three months.
The president of the party, Sabri Godo, said Sunday (July 6th) that the time had come for representation at this level.
"We have communicated with Prime Minister [Sali] Berisha, and he has supported such a decision, but we will wait a few more days for the issue to be resolved," Godo said.
RP members lost their cabinet posts in March when the leader of the party, Fatmir Mediu, resigned as defence minister after the Gerdec blast.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO's Allied Joint Force Commander in Naples, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, said on Tuesday (August 10th) that UN Resolution 1244 remains a political guide for NATO and that it is up to the UN to determine whether the mission will change. 
The July 22nd International Court of Justice opinion upholding Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence "does not change" KFOR's mission. 
"We will continue to implement Resolution1244, to implement a calm and secure environment and we will guard Kosovo borders," Fitzgerald said during a visit to Pristina. 
He added that any progress by the Kosovo Security Forces and the Kosovo police is a step towards KFOR's departure.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The public is growing increasingly dissatisfied with the government, according to an Early Warning Report from the UN Development Programme (UNDP), published on Friday (March 19th).
A survey conducted earlier this year among more than 1,200 respondents found the level of discontent up by 20%, compared to survey six months ago.
Since May 2008, more and more people -- currently 92% -- have been blaming the government and political parties for the current economic situation.
There is a similar trend developing regarding the EULEX mission.
Only 30% of respondents say they are satisfied with its work, compared to 40% last year.

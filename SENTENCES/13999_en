SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A World Bank mission led by Bruce Courtney started talks Monday (16 January) with the Macedonian government on the Second Programmatic Development Policy Loan (PDPL), worth $30m.
In October, the Bank's board endorsed the disbursement of the First PDPL of $30m -- designated for support of the country's structural reforms -- and confirmed plans to extend other two loans in the same amount.
In other news Monday, protestors demonstrated in Skopje against government plans to privatise the state power utility ESM Distribucja.
Critics say the sale would result in a private monopoly as well as electricity price hikes.
They plan protests for the next five days.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski formally announced on Thursday (May28th) the creation of a new political party, "United for Macedonia".
He cited speedy accession to the EU and NATO as party priorities and said it will promote real dialogue and tolerance.
The party holds its constituent assembly Friday.
Boskovski left his former party, VMRO-DPMNE, in July, after the UN tribunal at The Hague acquitted him of war crimes charges.
He ran for president earlier this year as an independent.

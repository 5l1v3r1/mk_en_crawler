SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Saturday (October 20th) that High Representative Miroslav Lajcak's latest measures were the worst since the Dayton Peace Treaty in 1995 and violated the accord.
Dodik's party will meet today and he plans to announce a programme of measures on Monday.
Lajcak's proposed measures include changes to the Law on the Council of Ministers of BiH and to the Rules of Procedure on the work of both houses of the state parliament, as well as measures to improve the co-ordination within the ruling coalition.
On Friday, Lajcak said that if Bosnian politicians fail to implement the proposed amendments by December 1st, he would have no other choice but to impose them and would probably sanction those who have rejected them.

ANKARA, Turkey -- At least two people were killed in bomb-related incidents in Turkey over the weekend. 
One person died and another one was injured when a car exploded in the Mediterranean port of Mersin late Saturday (13 August). 
Police believe that the victims were planning to plant the device when it went off in their vehicle. 
In another incident, the governor of the eastern Turkish province of Elazig escaped injury when a bomb went off near his car. 
In the southeastern Hakkari region, meanwhile, Turkish soldiers killed a Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) terrorist while he was trying to plant an explosive device on a road often used by military convoys. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but authorities believe that they were the work of the PKK. 
On Friday, mayors of 57 municipalities in southeast Turkey issued a joint appeal, calling on the PKK to cease armed combat against the Turkish state. 
The pro-Kurdish Democratic People's Party governs the 57 municipalities.
In other news, eight people were arrested in Istanbul on Sunday after clashes between police and left-wing demonstrators, according to Anadolu news agency. 
The demonstrators, commemorating the death of a left-wing militant during an army raid in eastern Turkey several months ago, reportedly threw firebombs at police.

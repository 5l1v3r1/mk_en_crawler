PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Repeat presidential elections could realistically be held in the second half of January, Montenegro's Mina news agency quoted State Election Commission chairman Borislav Radulovic as saying on Monday (23 December).
Though Parliament Speaker and acting President Filip Vujanovic was the clear winner with 86 per cent of the vote, Sunday's election was declared invalid because voter turnout fell short of the required 50 per cent.
Zlatko Vujovic of Podgorica's Centre for Election Monitoring, one of the major NGOs observing the vote, says he expects the next round to be held on 12 or 19 January.
Meanwhile, international observers called for election law changes that would preclude what they called the "endless repetition of elections".

ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Chief of General Staff Ilker Basbug said Monday (6 October) that Turkey does not receive sufficient international support for its efforts to fight terrorism. 
At the opening ceremony of the Turkish Armed Forces Partnership for Peace Training Centre, Basbug said that Turkey has been targeted by terrorists for years and has tried to draw international attention to the dangers this poses to global security. 
He called for more active international co-operation in eliminating threats to global security and for stricter sanctions against countries that fail to co-operate.

STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution Tuesday (25 January) on the protection of human rights in Kosovo. 
The document urges the establishment of a special human rights court through the joint efforts of UNMIK, the CoE and KFOR, as well as through co-operation with Serbia-Montenegro institutions. 
Kosovo Ombudsman Marek Antoni Nowicki told the assembly on Tuesday that although the human rights situation in Kosovo has improved in certain sectors, the general level remains below international standards.

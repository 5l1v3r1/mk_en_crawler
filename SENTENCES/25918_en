TIRANA, Albania -- The government must complete more work before an exact date for visa liberalisation is set, the head of the European Commission's (EC) External Relations and Enlargement Unit, Luigi Soreca, said on Wednesday (November 18th).
The dialogue launched by the EC with five countries in the region was based on a road map and clear technical and political standards that must be met, Soreca told the BBC.
Liberalising visas for Albanian citizens will depend on the country's progress in meeting these standards, Soreca added.

TIRANA, Albania -- Democratic Party (DP) leader Sali Berisha, who expects to be given the mandate to form a new government after DP's strong showing in the July parliamentary elections, disclosed his plans Wednesday (17 August) to reorganise the cabinet.
The most important change envisions the merger of the ministry of public order with the ministry of local power and decentralisation to form a new ministry of internal affairs.
He also said he would propose incorporating the tourism portfolio within the current ministry of culture, while the ministry of industry and energy would be folded into a new, expanded economy ministry.

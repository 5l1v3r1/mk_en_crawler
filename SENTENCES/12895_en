STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee adopted the progress report for Bulgaria on Tuesday (30 November), confirming the country is en route to joining the EU in 2007. 
However, the committee also endorsed an amendment to the document, suggesting that Bulgaria's timetable for accession "should not be linked to that of any other candidate country". 
Brussels' official position thus far is that Bulgaria and Romania should be invited together to seal the Accession Treaty in 2005, then enter the EU in 2007.

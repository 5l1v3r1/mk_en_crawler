BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tomislav Nikolic, leader of the popular opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), said on Thursday (March 4th) that within days, the SNS will have collected one million signatures in support of their initiative for early elections.
The party plans to submit the signatures to Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, who, along with the senior ruling Democratic Party, will have to decide on how to proceed.
The SNS initiative, backed by the Democratic Party of Serbia and the New Serbia party, is largely symbolic, as the constitution does not oblige the prime minister or the president to dissolve parliament based on petitions.

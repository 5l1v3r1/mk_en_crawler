ATHENS, Skopje -- The UN envoy in the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, Matthew Nimetz, plans to visit both Athens and Skopje after consulting separately with their representatives in New York last week.
He made no new proposals during talks with Greek envoy Adamantios Vassilakis, and Macedonian representative Nikola Dimitrov, but urged both to continue dialogue in order to resolve the matter.
No timeframe for his trip to the Balkans was announced.

TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha told members of parliament on Tuesday (January 29th) that the government would be ready to help an independent Kosovo in case Serbia decides to set up a blockade.
The Serbian government recently said it has developed such a plan in case Kosovo breaks away.
Berisha expressed hope that the Serbian government would not resort to "archaic or atavistic measures" that could harm the co-operative climate in the region.
Also on Monday, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci met with UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker and KFOR Commander Xavier Bout de Marnhac.
Thaci said Kosovo institutions, UNMIK and KFOR have drafted plans to guarantee security in Kosovo after independence is declared.

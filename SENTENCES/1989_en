The Macedonian government has decided to repeal customs duties for raw materials in the agriculture, textile and machinery industries, starting on Friday (1 July).
Elimination of the tariffs -- which ranged from 3 per cent to 18 per cent -- had been scheduled for early 2006, when a new customs law comes into effect, but the government decided to move up this particular provision to strengthen the country's business climate.
"Keeping in mind that the customs law which should enter into force early next year provides for customs empowerments, the government has decided to use its discretion rights in the interim and apply Article 24 providing for repeal of the customs duties in the sectors of agriculture, textile industry and machinery for raw materials not produced in Macedonia," said Ilija Iljoski, director of the Macedonian Customs Administration.
The move applies to all tariffs on imported raw materials in the three sectors.
There is an initial list of 300 to 400 custom tariff numbers that will be repealed.
Within the next 10 days or so, the Macedonian Customs Administration is expected to issue a projection on the fiscal impact of the new measure.
"Despite the fact that the budget is closed for this year, it shall not be affected and there is not any need to take other counter measures in order to fill in a possible hole in the state budget.
We will take into account the collective numbers for imports in the past three years as well as the sums chargeable to the customs for these raw materials," Iljoski said.

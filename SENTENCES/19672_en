SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission (EC) continues to analyse the two major police reform laws approved by the BiH House of Representatives last week and thus cannot comment on whether they meet required principles, Kristina Nagy, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesperson, said on Thursday (February 21st).
She added that as long as the laws meet the commitments of the Mostar Declaration and the action plan for its implementation, they would satisfy the EC.
She said the commission now expects the entire parliamentary approval process to be finalised soon.
Police reform is the main condition for BiH to be able to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

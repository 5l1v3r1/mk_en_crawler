PARIS, France -- The EU is considering the option of sending a mission to Kosovo, regardless of the outcome of ongoing status negotiations, Le Monde reported on Wednesday (September 26th), citing diplomatic sources in Brussels.
The mission's deployment would be based on UN Security Council Resolution 1244 regarding Kosovo.
The newspaper said US and EU diplomats think the provisions of Resolution 1244 for "sovereignty of (former) Yugoslavia, succeeded by Serbia, over Kosovo" could be circumvented because Serbian authorities excluded Kosovo Albanians from the referendum last October on the country's constitution, implicitly suggesting they were not citizens of Serbia.

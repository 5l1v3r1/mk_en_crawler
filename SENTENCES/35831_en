BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's new parliament failed to elect a speaker during its inaugural session Tuesday (27 January), as neither of the two candidates -- Dragan Marsicanin of the Democratic Party of Serbia and Gordana Pop-Lazic of the ultra nationalist Serbian Radical Party -- garnered enough votes.
Another session is scheduled for Friday.
Failure to elect a speaker would result in new elections.
Talks are also continuing on a new cabinet.
On Tuesday, Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Walter Schwimmer said Serbia must form a stable cabinet that would work to fulfill obligations stemming from CoE membership.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown decided Thursday (9 June) to lift sanctions that had banned two people from participating in politics.
Nikola Grabovac, a former federal finance minister, was removed in 2002 due to an investigation by the Sarajevo cantonal prosecution.
Blasko Jevric, who was banned from politics in 2000, can participate again, but with certain restrictions.
He cannot be a candidate in the next elections and cannot hold any public office related to refugee returns.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in Novi Pazar on Friday (July 24th) and said Ankara will invest in construction of a highway through Sandzak.
The Turkish diplomat called the Sandzak region "a green light" for further co-operation between the two countries.
Jeremic described Davutoglu's visit to the region as one of the most historic days in bilateral ties.
"Together we'll work on a highway that crosses Sandzak, and for this we'll require unity among people, political parties, unity between states," he added.

TIRANA, Albania -- The country's Central Electoral Commission (CEC) decided on Sunday (April 22nd) to repeat municipal elections in 21 localities on May 6th.
At issue are the February 18th local elections in Elbasan.
The CEC decided that because the poll in one district was confirmed as invalid, elections in every district there should be repeated.
The Socialist Party vows to appeal the decision, accusing the CEC of trying to snatch victory from it.

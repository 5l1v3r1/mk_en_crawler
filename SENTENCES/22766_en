TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi nominated six new candidates Tuesday (July 8th) to fill vacant posts at Albania's High Court.
Parliament will now review the nominations.
Earlier this week, two major parties -- the ruling Democratic Party (DS) and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP) -- agreed to change the parliamentary evaluation procedures in order to introduce a discussion between the parliament and the president before the lawmakers make their decision.
Lawmakers rejected the president's previous decrees on members of the High Court two weeks ago, triggering a political crisis.

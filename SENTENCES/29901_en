TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) is calling for calm in Albania and urging leaders to resume dialogue aimed at ending the long-standing political stalemate. 
The EU's executive also recommended a detailed investigation be conducted into the violent demonstrations that hit Tirana last week.
EC spokesperson Natasha Butler said on Monday (January 24th) that violence must not be repeated while political leaders focus on a solution to end the ongoing stalemate. 
Albania should move beyond short-term political disagreements and focus on the European integration agenda, she said.
Meanwhile, a warrant for the arrests of six National Guard members is still pending. 
They are suspected of exceeding their authority during the demonstrations that ended with three people dead and dozens injured. 
The government is defending the actions of the Guard and wants prosecutors to investigate the organisers of the demonstration. 
So far, a court in Tirana has ordered the arrest of 27 citizens; 87 others have been ordered to report to the court.

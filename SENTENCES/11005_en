ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign and EU Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic kicked off a three-day trip to the United States on Thursday (28 July), beginning with talks in Washington with State Department officials.
She stressed that relations remain good and both sides appear determined to strengthen them, citing joint efforts against terrorism as one of the areas where co-operation could be expanded.
Washington views Croatia as a regional leader and relies on it to support stability and security in Southeast Europe, Grabar-Kitarovic said.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova died on Saturday (21 January) at the age of 61, after battling lung cancer for months.
A spokesman said Rugova died at his residence in the Velania quarter, surrounded by his family.
A key figure in the Kosovo Albanians' struggle for independence from Belgrade, Rugova was diagnosed in September but chose to remain in office.
In a statement Sunday, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan praised Rugova for his "true leadership" and for having advocated a peaceful solution for Kosovo.
He urged ethnic Albanian parties to maintain unity and sustain Rugova's legacy of peace as the process of resolving the province's final status gets under way.
Martti Ahtisaari, Annan's special envoy for status talks, issued a similar appeal.
Kosovo is observing five days of mourning, which means Wednesday's scheduled start of direct talks between delegations from Pristina and Belgrade in Vienna will likely be postponed.
Kosovo Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci is expected to be named acting president.

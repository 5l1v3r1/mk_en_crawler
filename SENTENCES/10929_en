BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Polling stations opened in 148 Serbian municipalities on Sunday (3 October) for a runoff local election.
Candidates of President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DP) are running against Radical Party ultranationalists in most cities.
Polls are giving the DP's Nenad Bogdanovic an edge in the race against Radical Aleksandar Vucic for mayor of Belgrade.
The outlook for the DP candidates has been boosted by an alliance with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia.
They now hope to be able to take Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, where a Radical candidate enjoyed a slight advantage during the first round of the elections.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Several thousand people gathered on Sunday (July 11th) to commemorate the Srebrenica massacre victims on the 15th anniversary of the atrocity.
Coffins with the remains of 775 recently identified victims were laid to rest at the Potocari Memorial Centre near Srebrenica.
European leaders and presidents of countries from the region attended the ceremony, along with relatives of the victims and local officials.
Serbian President Boris Tadic, who was in attending, condemned the crime and vowed that Belgrade will not give up its efforts to find former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic.
Mladic who is still at large has been indicted by The Hague war crimes tribunal for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes stemming from his role in the war and particularly the killing of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica.
On Monday, a commemoration ceremony for Serbs killed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war will take place at the Bratunac military cemetery.

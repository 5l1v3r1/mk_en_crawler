SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's anti-mafia services have smashed a cigarette smuggling ring involving Bulgarian and Turkish citizens, including two officers with the Bulgarian border police.
Varna regional military prosecutor Vladimir Chavdarov announced on Sunday (November 26th) that 25 people -- 22 Bulgarians and three Turks -- were arrested near the Black Sea village of Tyulenovo the previous night.
He says they were trying to unload 1,400 boxes of cigarettes from a Turkish ship traveling from Varna to Georgia.

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, predicted on Sunday (May 22nd) that Croatia could wrap up its EU accession talks by the end of June. 
In an interview posted on the website of the Hungarian EU presidency, he says that the issue will be discussed by EU officials during a working dinner Monday. 
He said the next days will be crucial in setting the date of Croatia's accession. 
Zagreb has four remaining chapters to close, including the two most problematic, on the judiciary and competition.
In other news Sunday, a new survey showed that support for EU membership has recovered after April's plunge in anticipation of the end of accession talks. 
A majority of 52% of citizens would vote in favour of joining the EU if a referendum was held today, according to the poll conducted by the Hendal agency for HTV. 
Last month, support fell to its lowest levels in five years, 44.6%, after The Hague tribunal convicted former Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac of war crimes.

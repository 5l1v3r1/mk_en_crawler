SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Newly elected member of the tripartite presidency Bakir Izetbegovic on Monday (November 1st) apologised for every innocent victim killed by the BiH army. 
Speaking to Serbian radio B92, Izetbegovic said all innocent victims are equal and offered his personal apology, but at the same time added that an official apology requires a compromise within BiH. 
Izetbegovic, son of BiH wartime president Alija Izetbegovic, said relations between Serbia and BiH have improved since the declaration on Srebrenica that Serbia's parliament adopted in March and Serbian President Boris Tadic's visit to Srebrenica. 
He stressed the importance of continuing efforts to normalise ties.

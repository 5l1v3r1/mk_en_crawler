SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chairmen of BiH state-level and entity parliaments agreed on Thursday (July 10th) to step up co-operation to secure faster approval of laws and commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Republika Srpska Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic, who initiated the meeting, said it was the first such conference since 2001.
He said it was high time the main legislative institutions discuss the future and strengthen co-operation.

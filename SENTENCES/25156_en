SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Negotiations on the name dispute between Greece and Macedonia under UN auspices are entering a new phase, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis was quoted as saying by Macedonian media on Tuesday (August 25th). 
According to the Greek daily Naftemporiki, Bakoyannis said Greece is facing an important six-month period for resolving key issues in its foreign policy, including the name row. 
She insisted that Greece is participating constructively in the talks in order to reach a mutually acceptable solution. 
The dispute has stalled Macedonia's bid for EU and NATO membership.

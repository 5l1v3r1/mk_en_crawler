BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokeswoman, Krisztina Nagy, said Tuesday (24 May) that the possibility of early elections in Romania is a domestic matter in which Brussels would not become involved. 
Nagy's statement followed a comment Monday evening by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, who suggested in a TV interview that the EU had warned early elections could affect the timetable for Romania's accession.

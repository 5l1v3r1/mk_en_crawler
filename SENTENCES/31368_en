SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Boris Trajkovski is very concerned by the increasing number of criminal acts and incidents, his spokesperson Borjan Jovanovski said Thursday (30 January).
Trajkovski believes an anti-crime campaign is necessary, as the increasing number of criminal incidents may seriously threaten democratic institutions and law enforcement.
He is insisting on a speedier start to the illegal weapons collection campaign.
Jovanovski also added that the formation of the National Security Council of the Republic of Macedonia is close to completion and the president will convene its first session very soon.

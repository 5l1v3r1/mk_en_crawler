BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Tomislav Limov, the head of the BiH parliamentary commission supervising the intelligence services, said Tuesday (21 June) that members would soon start consultations aimed at establishing state-level counter-intelligence and military intelligence agencies.
He urged the international community to assist in the process.
A separate Intelligence and Security Agency is already in place.
In other news, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic told RS Radio on Tuesday that the government is working on a new concept for police reform in BiH, but did not elaborate.
RS rejected a prior version because its police regions crossed entity borders.
Also Tuesday, EUFOR issued a statement concluding that an oath-swearing ceremony for new Federation of BiH Army recruits in Capljina last week was acceptable.
Though the playing of the Croatian national anthem was criticised, investigators did not find the same pervasive violations of law or military discipline evidenced among recruits in RS earlier this year.

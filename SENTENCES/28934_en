PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic said on Sunday (August 8th) Serbs and Albanians should live together, very different rhetoric that he used during previous visits to Kosovo. 
Bogdanovic was commemorating an anniversary of the Serbs' return to the western municipality of Istog. 
While visiting the village of Osojan, he said that Belgrade is prepared to start a dialogue with Albanians and called on Serbs to reconcile with their Albanian neighbours. 
Bogdanovic told the returnees that he sees the solution of problems between Albanians and Serbs based on a mutual compromise, and promised state investments in the returnees' villages. 
But Serb returnees to the village of Zallq/Zac told him that they have had enough of Belgrade's manipulations and asked him not to politicise security issues. 
Bogdanovic came to Kosovo with Pristina's permission and was escorted by police.

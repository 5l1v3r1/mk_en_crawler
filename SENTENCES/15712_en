BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic will participate in their first direct talks on Kosovo's future status, due to be held in Vienna on Monday (24 July), a government spokesman said at the weekend. 
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Ceku are expected to represent Pristina in the talks.
In other news, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was in Belgrade Friday for meetings with Kostunica and Tadic. 
He said bilateral co-operation has stepped up significantly over the past year, expressed confidence that Serbia's action plan for co-operation with the UN tribunal would bring results, and reiterated his government's position on Kosovo -- namely, that any solution must involve Belgrade, and should not be unilaterally imposed. 
On Friday, Sanader and Kostunica also opened the modernised border checkpoint at Batrovci-Bajakovo, which was co-financed by the EU.

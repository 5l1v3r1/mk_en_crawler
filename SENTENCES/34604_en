BUCHAREST, Romania -- Railway workers staged a national two-hour strike on Thursday (28 August) to protest the government's intention to cut 19,000 jobs.
The cuts are part of an IMF-approved government plan to restructure the national railway company.
Romania intends to slash the number of railway employees from 104,000 to 56,000 by 2007.
In other news, the Romanian Association of Agricultural Producers estimates that the ongoing drought has cost farmers 400m euros in losses.
Earlier, the agriculture ministry had estimated losses at 65m euros.
The association accused the government of low-balling the figure to avoid paying additional compensation.

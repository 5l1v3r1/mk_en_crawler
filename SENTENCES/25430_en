NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The UN office in Cyprus issued a statement on Friday (September 25th) calling Greek Cypriot media reports that UN envoy Alexander Downer has business interests in Turkey totally false. 
"Mr. 
Downer has no business interests in either Turkey or Greece and has never in his life conducted any business with or in either of those countries," it added. 
Nicosia-based daily Simerini reported recently that Downer is a partner in Bespoke Approach, an Australian-based consultancy company. 
Bespoke has reportedly had dealings with a US-based investment fund manager KKR, which is involved in the acquisition of Turkey's biggest shipping company.

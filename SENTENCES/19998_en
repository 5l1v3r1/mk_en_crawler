ANKARA, Turkey -- The army confirmed on Tuesday (December 18th) it launched a small-scale ground incursion in northern Iraq to prevent Kurdish militants from entering Turkey.
The General Staff said in a statement that the militants suffered serious losses after ground forces went "a few kilometres" into Iraq's territory.
The government of Iraqi Kurdistan said 500 Turkish troops were involved.
The pro-Kurdish Firat news agency says seven people were killed in the operation, including two civilians.
In its statement Tuesday, the Turkish Army reiterated its resolve to "maintain its responsibilities" and to continue such actions against members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Meanwhile, during a visit to Baghdad on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Turkey to take a "comprehensive approach" to the PKK attacks, and avoid "anything that could lead to innocent civilian casualties or to a destabilisation of the north".

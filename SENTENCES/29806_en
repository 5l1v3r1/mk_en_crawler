TIRANA, Albania -- A coalition of local observers warns that campaign-related incidents have ratcheted up fear and tension levels ahead of the May 8th elections.
In their first report Thursday (April 21st), the group of NGOs condemned the incidents and those involved.
Rhetoric and offensive language have no place in the campaign, the coalition noted.
Among the violations registered so far is pressure on public administration staff to campaign and vote for specific candidates.

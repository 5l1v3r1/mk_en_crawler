WASHINGTON, United States -- Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama says he supports the independence of Kosovo. 
In a letter to the National Albanian-American Council, presented during a dinner ceremony Friday (September 19th), at which US negotiator Frank Wisner and Congressman Eliot Engel received awards for their support of the Albanian community, Obama said "I support Kosovo's independence and her desire to move towards full sovereignty. 
I believe that the United States should help develop a strong democracy in Kosovo that will be guaranteed by the application of laws that safeguard the interests of all people. 
I support Kosovo's integration in Euro-Atlantic institutions." (Koha Ditore, New Kosova report, Netpress, Politika, B92 - 23/09/08)

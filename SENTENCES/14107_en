DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- Two people were injured when a bomb went off Wednesday (15 March) in front of an office of the British bank HSBC in Diyarbakir. 
In November 2003, HSBC's headquarters in Istanbul was targeted during an al-Qaeda bombing campaign, along with the British consulate and two synagogues in the city. 
The blasts killed a total of 61 people and injured more than 600.

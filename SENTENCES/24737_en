BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO foreign and defence ministers have prepared a Partnership for Peace action plan to expand co-operation with Serbia, media reported on Thursday (December 4th). 
In a joint statement Wednesday at the end of their two-day annual meeting in Brussels, the ministers said they support Serbia's Euro-Atlantic integration process "in light of the new government's commitment to Euro-Atlantic values and partnership", stressing that the recent signing of a NATO-Serbia agreement on the security of information exchanges constitutes an important step in that direction.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Representatives of EULEX and the Kosovo Chamber of Advocates signed a memorandum of understanding Thursday (June 24th) aimed at boosting the quality of the judiciary, especially in handling criminal cases and trials. 
The president of the Assembly of EULEX Judges, Maria Giuliana Civinini, says there is a need for co-operation among judges, prosecutors and lawyers.
In other news, the District Court of Mitrovica is expected to resume work by mid-July. 
Four judges -- two Albanians and two Serbs -- will hear cases with their EULEX colleagues for the first time since March 2008. 
The court closed after Serbs clashed with international security forces over Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia, looting court files.

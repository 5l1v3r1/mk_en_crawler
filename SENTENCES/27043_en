ANKARA, Turkey -- Eleven people charged with gunning down dozens of guests attending a wedding in May went on trial Wednesday (September 2nd). 
When the machine gun fire stopped, 44 people were dead in the small village of Bilge, in the Kurd-dominated southeast. 
Hearings were held behind closed doors in the city of Corum, since one of the suspects is a minor -- a 14-year-old boy. 
Prosecutors insist that nine of the suspects face life imprisonment without any chance of parole for the premeditated "honour killings". 
The minor and another suspect who allegedly played an indirect role in the murders could receive lesser sentences if convicted. 
NTV reports that three of the suspects, including the minor and his father, have pleaded guilty.

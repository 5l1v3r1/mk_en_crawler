TIRANA, Albania -- Germany donated 28 military vehicles, worth a total of 150,000 euros to Albania at a ceremony Friday (December 1st).
The German Ambassador to Tirana, Hans Peter Annen, and Albanian Deputy Defence Minister Zana Xhuka described the donation as an indication of Germany's firm support for Albania's Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
Hungarian Parliament Speaker Katalin Szili delivered a similar message of support Friday during a visit to Tirana.
She stressed the positive signals concerning Albania's Euro-Atlantic bid, including the sealing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU earlier this year and, more recently, the praise Albania received at NATO's summit in Riga.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Party for BiH (SBiH) will propose a new candidate for the Federation BiH (FBiH) interior minister, according to an announcement Sunday (March 25th). 
The party's original candidate, Fadic Jaganjac failed the Office of the High Representative's vetting process. 
The new candidate is Muhidin Alic, a member of FBiH House of Representatives. 
Last week, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling suspended the appointment of the new entity government a day after Parliament approved it, saying he obliged to react to "a blatant attempt to appoint a questionable candidate by manipulating the vetting system".

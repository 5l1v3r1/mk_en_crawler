TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialist Party (SP) invited small parties in the ruling coalition on Tuesday (5 October) to join the commission on electoral reform. 
Until now, only the two main parties -- the SP and the opposition Democratic Party -- were involved in the discussions as members of the bipartisan commission. 
The panel has become deadlocked due to political squabbling.
On Wednesday meanwhile, Czech diplomat Pavel Vacek becomes the new head of the OSCE Presence in Albania. 
He replaces Osmo Lipponen, whose mandate ended recently.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The top administrative court, the Council of State, suspended on Wednesday (10 May) a 2.3 billion-euro deal for the steelmaker Erdemir after a local union, the TMMOB association of engineers and architects, contested the sales procedure. 
The court said the decision of the Turkish Competition Board, approving the sale of 46.12 per cent of Erdemir to the local pension and investment fund Oyak Group, did not fully comply with domestic privatisation laws. 
The sale is envisioned in the government's IMF-backed privatisation programme.

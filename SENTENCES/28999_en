STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Police have arrested a second war crimes suspect of Serbian origin for suspected war crimes committed in Kosovo in 1999, media reported on Tuesday (June 8th).
The man, 36, was detained in the town of Orebro last week but was released from custody Friday, despite lingering suspicions, according to the local prosecutor.
The suspect is believed to have committed crimes in the village of Qyshk/Cuska, where 41 people were killed in May 1999.
Swedish authorities detained another Kosovo Serb in April for suspected involvement in the same incident.
He remains in custody.

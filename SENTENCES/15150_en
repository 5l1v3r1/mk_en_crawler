SOFIA, Bulgaria -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is expected to arrive in Bulgaria on Friday (1 September), his last such visit before the European Commission (EC) issues its monitoring report on 26 September. 
Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin said Rehn would be making a final assessment of Bulgaria's progress in the accession process. 
On Tuesday, Kalfin said officials must convince Rehn that Sofia will meet all EU membership commitments by the end of the year. 
Previous EC reports cited agriculture, the judiciary and utilisation of EU funding as areas of concern.
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov, who was on a visit to Norway on Tuesday, said it is absolutely realistic to expect Bulgaria to join EU on 1 January 2007, as scheduled.

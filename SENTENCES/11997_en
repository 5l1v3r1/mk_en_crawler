PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Monday (14 February) that Serbia wants a peaceful solution for Kosovo and peace for the Serb and other minorities living in the province. 
He also urged Kosovo's international authorities to uphold minority rights. 
Speaking to residents of Serb enclaves, Tadic reiterated his opposition to independence for the province but signalled that he was willing to engage in internationally-mediated negotiations. 
Responding to Tadic's comments, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova said the issue of Kosovo's independence is a matter for the international community, not Serbia, to decide.

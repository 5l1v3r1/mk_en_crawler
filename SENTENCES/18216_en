SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The appeals panel of the special war crimes court in Sarajevo has sentenced a Serb man to 24 years in prison, up from the 13 year-sentence he initially received, for the persecution and rape of Muslim prisoners in 1992. 
The chamber overturned Nedjo Samardzic's original sentence on procedural grounds and said it viewed as an aggravating circumstance the fact that he had been convicted of murder before the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
Samardzic was serving the murder sentence when he escaped from prison to join the Bosnian Serb army at the beginning of the Bosnian conflict.

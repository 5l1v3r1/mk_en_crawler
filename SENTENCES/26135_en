NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias told a press conference Thursday (March 18th) that he will not seek re-election if talks to reunify the divided island fail.
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat have resumed UN-brokered talks aimed at ending decades of division in Cyprus but have made only limited progress so far.
Christofias was elected to a five-year term in 2008, promising to resolve the Cypriot issue.

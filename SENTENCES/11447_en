SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH task force for enhanced co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal will complete an action plan in two weeks, according to a statement Monday (21 February) by the BiH Council of Ministers.
Proposed measures include tightening control over BiH's border with Serbia-Montenegro, to prevent illegal crossing and movement of war crimes suspects in the region.
On Tuesday meanwhile, the five major BiH parties representing the three constituent peoples began a meeting in Neum.
The two-day talks are intended to address the most acute problems in the country.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Despite pledges that a political agreement on crucial constitutional reforms would be reached by March, the main BiH parties remain unable to strike a deal.
Following another round of negotiations in Sarajevo on Wednesday (1 March), participants decided to approach the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's arm for legal matters, with a request for assistance.
They sent all proposals to the Commission for review and recommendations.
The United States is mediating the BiH effort.

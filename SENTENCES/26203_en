BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Thursday (January 14th) he will not attend next month's inauguration of Croatian President-elect Ivo Josipovic if Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu is present. 
Tadic said appearing with Sejdiu would signal de facto recognition of Kosovo's independence. 
"Serbia is ready to take part in regional gatherings where Kosovo is represented as UNMIK-Kosovo or Kosovo-UNMIK," Tadic said. 
The Zagreb ceremony is scheduled for February 18th.

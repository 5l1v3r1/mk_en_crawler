BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament narrowly rejected on Thursday (March 1st) President Traian Basescu's request for a referendum on introducing a majority voting system.
But local media reports note that Basecu could begin preparations for a referendum even if Parliament opposes it.
He has invited the various parties to a series of talks next week to discuss the issue, with an eye to changing the manner in which members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are elected.

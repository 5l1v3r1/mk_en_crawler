BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two Turkish nationals and a Syrian have been arrested in Romania for allegedly funding the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) with profits made from drug trafficking. 
Romanian prosecutors said on Wednesday (December 19th) that the three smuggled drugs between June and December. 
Authorities at the Bulgarian-Turkish border discovered the operation by stopping a truck last week that had heroin hidden inside.
In other news Wednesday, police in Austria arrested eight people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Albania, Romania and Austria suspected of involvement in an international drug smuggling ring. 
The arrests followed a nine month police operation.

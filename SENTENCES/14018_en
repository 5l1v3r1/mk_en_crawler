LONDON, United Kingdom -- A poll conducted by the World Bank and the EBRD suggests a mixed picture of corruption in the Balkans against the backdrop of a general decline in graft across Eastern Europe.
According to the 8,000 companies surveyed, corruption is on the rise in Macedonia and Serbia, but is dropping in other countries in the region.
The survey also suggests that economic growth in Southeast Europe will drop to 4.8 per cent in 2005 from 6.5 per cent in 2004.
The promise of EU membership for Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia has helped keep the economic growth figure fairly high, the two banks said.

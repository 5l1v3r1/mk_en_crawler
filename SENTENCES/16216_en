BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission said on Tuesday (16 May) that both Romania and Bulgaria could join the EU on 1 January 2007.
However, it put off making a recommendation to the EU member states until after October.
According to the Commission, the final recommendation would be made in the next progress report on the two countries.
The report, presented to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, was highly critical of Bulgaria, saying the country had not taken adequate steps to combat organised crime, corruption, and money laundering.
Sofia will have to show improvement in a total of six areas by October.
Romania was told to address four concerns, such as the absence of an adequate computer system for tax collection and poor food hygiene standards.

TIRANA, Albania -- The High Court in Tirana on Monday (July 6th) again postponed the trial of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu who faces charges of abuse of power. 
Mediu's lawyers failed to appear in court, blaming the temporary closure of a tunnel along the Durres-Kukes Highway. 
Prosecutors say the tunnel closing was announced days in advance. 
Proceedings are now scheduled to begin in September. 
Mediu is charged in connection with last year's Gerdec ammunition depot explosions that killed 26 people and injured 300.

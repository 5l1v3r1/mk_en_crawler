BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade on Friday (December 10th) acquitted ten people charged with helping former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic evade justice.
Eleven people were arrested four years ago on suspicion of sheltering Mladic between 2002 and 2006 in rented apartments in Belgrade.
In the meantime one of the defendants has passed away.
All of them have rejected the accusations.
The prosecution vowed to appeal.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian ruling Liberal Party expelled one of its most popular functionaries on Saturday (2 September), after she admitted working for the Securitate secret communist police.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said former Culture Minister Mona Musca was forced out of the party by a vote of 62-5 with one abstention.
Musca, who is known as a strong proponent of democratic reform, apologized for her actions.
She said she provided information to Securitate about foreign students she taught in college.
At the same meeting the Liberals also expelled Ioan Ghise, a senior party member who spied on foreigners in the 1980s.

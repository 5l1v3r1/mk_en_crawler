BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior ministry officials arrested four people Sunday (September 28th) who allegedly hung 30 posters depicting a mock obituary of EU security chief Javier Solana on the walls of apartment buildings around Belgrade.
Two of the four are described as minors.
According to media reports, the posters read "Our dear Javier Solana finally died on September 28th in the 66th year of his felonious life." The "bereaved" included Serbia's ruling coalition, the EU, NATO and supporters of Serbia's EU membership.

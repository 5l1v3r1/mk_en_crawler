In other news Tuesday, US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt met with Serbia's Justice Minister Zoran Stojakovic, reiterating that the arrest of indictee Ratko Mladic remains a priority.
Polt added that there could be no deadline set for extraditing Mladic, as every feasible deadline had already come and gone.
Also Tuesday, Serbia-Montenegro's parliamentary defence commission failed to endorse the draft national defence plan submitted by the federal government and returned the bill for adjustment.

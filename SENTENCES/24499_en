SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The trade union representing police announced on Tuesday (December 9th) it plans to organise a protest to demand better pay.
The demonstration would likely be both unprecedented and illegal, as law enforcement officials cannot participate in any form of protest rallies.
The union says it presented its concerns to Interior Minister Mihail Mikov when he assumed office at the beginning of the summer, but no meetings have taken place.

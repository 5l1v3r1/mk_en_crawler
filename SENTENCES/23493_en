SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the three main political parties in BiH, Milorad Dodik of the Union of Independent Social Democrats, Sulejman Tihic of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and Dragan Covic of the Croatian Democratic Union, agreed on Monday (December 22nd) to send an initiative to parliament to revise the country's constitution. 
"We have decided to ask the central parliament to start the procedure for constitutional reform," Tihic said after a meeting with his Serb and Croat counterparts. 
He explained the reform should allow for "more functional central institutions and the territorial organisation of the central and lower levels of government". 
The initiative also called on parliament to proceed with implementation of the so-called Prud agreement, which aims to speed up EU integration reforms. 
The three leaders also agreed to propose forming an inter-ministerial committee that will draft a law on the nationwide census.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's High Judicial Council endorsed the appointment Thursday (19 January) of Boris Velchev as the new chief prosecutor.
Velchev, currently legal adviser to President Georgi Parvanov, was the sole candidate for the post.
He will assume it on 22 February, when the mandate of incumbent Nikola Filchev expires.
Presenting his programme for the next seven years, Velchev vowed to remove conflicts among judicial institutions and cited the fight against organised crime as his top priority.

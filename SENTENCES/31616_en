ANKARA, Turkey -- The government announced Thursday (16 January) that it wants to call a regional summit on Iraq next week.
It plans to invite the leaders of Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria to discuss ways to avoid a new war in the Gulf.
"Saddam Hussein must stop being a threat to the region and the world.
And he has to prove that.
Our primary objective as countries in the region is to exert pressure on Saddam in this direction," Prime Minister Abdullah Gul told the <I>Milliyet</I> newspaper.
He visited the Middle East earlier this month to assess views there.
Meanwhile, Gen Richard Myers, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, is expected in Ankara on Monday for meetings with Turkey's top military commanders.

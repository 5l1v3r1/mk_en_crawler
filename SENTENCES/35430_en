SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts on Monday (14 June) started to excavate the first mass grave to be identified by the Bosnian Serb authorities. 
Bosnian Muslim Commission for Missing Persons chief Amor Masovic said a Republika Srpska commission has found evidence that about 20 people from Srebrenica may have been buried there. 
It is one of 32 new sites identified in the commission's report, released last week.

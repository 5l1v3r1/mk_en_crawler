BERLIN, Germany -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in Sarajevo, told a German newspaper on Tuesday (7 October) that the United States should continue to play a strong role in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
He welcomed EU offers to take over the peacekeeping mission from NATO, but urged Washington to retain its presence. 
"The Europeans should not underestimate the fact that they have a trust problem. 
Many people in BiH see them as the people who left them in the lurch. 
And they say it was the United States that ended the war," he explained.

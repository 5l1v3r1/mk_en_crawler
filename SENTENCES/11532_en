ATHENS, Greece -- Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said in an interview published Sunday (23 January) that Greece is using its status as member of NATO and the EU to press his country to change its name, citing threats from Athens to block Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO. 
"We propose that our constitutional name be used in our international relations while a mutually acceptable solution is found in our bilateral relations," Crvenkovski said.
In other news, Austrian Ambassador to the UN Wolfgang Petritsch, the former high representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, says he believes that a civil, rather than an ethnic concept, is the key to Macedonia's development. 
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Petritsch added that 2005 is a crucial year for the entire region.

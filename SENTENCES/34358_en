BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian leaders on Friday (24 October) opened a special high-security war crimes court.
The building was renovated with $850,000 from the US government.
The first suspects to be tried there would be 44 underworld figures charged with complicity in the murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Their trial is scheduled to start on 17 December.
Djindjic's successor, Zoran Zivkovic, told reporters that the new court would also try four generals indicted by The Hague tribunal recently.
Members of the Serbian government have made it clear that they would not arrest or extradite the suspects soon.
In response, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Serbia has an obligation to turn in war crimes suspects to the tribunal.
Also Friday, thousands of uniformed police officers rallied in Belgrade to protest the indictment of Deputy Interior Minister Sreten Lukic and one other police general.
The government supported the rally and calls for a revision of the indictment.

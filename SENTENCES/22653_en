PRISTINA, Kosovo -- On Friday (October 10th), the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) arrested a Serb suspected of committing war crimes during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo.
Authorities say Dejan Tomic, 35, killed two ethnic Albanians early in 1999.
A warrant for his arrest was issued in 2003.
In other news, thousands of police officers fanned out in downtown Belgrade on Saturday to prevent a rally by neo-Nazi and ultra-nationalist groups.
Officers arrested 34 suspected far-right activists heading to the area.
Authorities had banned their demonstration, fearing clashes would erupt with about 500 anti-fascists who were holding a peaceful rally in the centre of Belgrade.

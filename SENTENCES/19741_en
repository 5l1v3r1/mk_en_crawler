WASHINGTON, United States -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Friday (December 21st) that Serbia and Kosovo will go separate ways. 
"Kosovo and Serbia will never be part of the same country again. 
I think that's quite clear. 
It was the logic even of [UN Resolution] 1244 on the special status accorded Kosovo as a result of the war. 
And the important thing is for these two peoples to get on with their futures," Rice said. 
Decisions about Kosovo status must be taken in the next several weeks in order to avoid destabilising the region, she added. 
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned on Friday that if Kosovo declares independence unilaterally and the UN Security Council proposes a resolution approving such independence, Russia will veto it. 
In an interview for the Russian newspaper Vremya Novostei, Lavrov said that imposing a veto would block the settlement of the issue.
In other news, the Serbian government has reached an agreement with the Iraqi Defense Ministry to export $230m worth of military equipment to Iraq. 
The deal was arranged during visits to Belgrade by Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul-Qadir al-Obaidi in September and November. 
While details were not revealed, experts believe Belgrade will sell assault rifles, machineguns, munitions, and anti-tank weapons to the new Iraqi Army.

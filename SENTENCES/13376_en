ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic said on Wednesday (21 September) that she is optimistic that the EU will soon open accession talks with Croatia. 
Returning from the UN summit in New York, Grabar-Kitarovic said she met with several EU counterparts and got the impression that most think Croatia is meeting its obligations to The Hague war crimes tribunal.
Also Wednesday, parliament began debating reforms proposed by the government and the opposition Croatian People's Party (HNS), related to local and regional self-government. 
The government draft would categorise towns: all those with more than 40,000 residents would be considered large and would be given more self-government. 
The HNS draft is more radical, and is aimed at holding direct elections for all mayors and municipal governors.

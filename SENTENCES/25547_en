BELGRADE, Serbia -- European Parliament Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin said in an interview with Belgrade-based daily Blic on Sunday (November 22nd) that it is not realistic to expect that Serbia could file its EU membership application by the end of 2009. 
"The application is a serious thing that's why we should be realistic," Kacin said. 
"An application should be filed when a positive answer could be expected," he added, ahead of his visit to Belgrade on Monday.

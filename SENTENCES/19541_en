SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sarajevo's war crimes chamber sentenced a Bosnian Serb man Friday (August 24th) to 12 years in jail for his role in ethnic cleansing during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Former policeman Nenad Tanaskovic was found guilty of evicting Muslims from their homes, separating men from women, and personally setting at least two homes on fire. 
The attacks in which Tanaskovic took part occurred in the Visegrad area. 
Most of the Muslim men who were taken into custody by Bosnian Serb forces were killed, with their remains later found in mass graves.
Victims' relatives and rights groups expressed disappointment with what they saw as a lenient sentence. 
A representative of the Women Victims of War was quoted as saying that Tanaskovic had probably committed much graver crimes but prosecutors had failed to properly investigate them and had not called all available witnesses.

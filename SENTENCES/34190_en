SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen urged Bulgaria on Thursday (10 July) to accelerate its judicial reforms.
He said the slow adoption of constitutional amendments related to the judiciary could affect efforts to complete accession talks with the EU in 2004.
Verheugen said changes should be passed by September if the country is to close negotiations on time.

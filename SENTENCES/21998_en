BUCHAREST, Romania -- State-owned Romanian nuclear operator Nuclearelectrica signed an agreement Thursday (November 20th) to build two new reactors at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant by 2015.
Finance and Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian described it as a "very big step to increase Romania's energy security".
Six companies signed the 4 billion-euro accord -- France's GDF Suez, Germany's RWE, the Czech Republic's CEZ and Italy's Enel with 9.15% each and Spain's Iberdrola and a local unit of steel giant ArcelorMittal with 6.2% each.
Nuclearelectrica will hold a 51% share on behalf of the state.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Milo Djukanovic, leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), said on Tuesday (September 11th) that new elections would not be necessary after the adoption of the new constitution. 
He explained that the new document provides the legal and technical framework of last year's referendum on independence. 
If the two thirds majority required in parliament for the adoption of the constitution is not reached, a referendum on it will be held.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten urged the Union to launch an honest debate on whether to allow Turkey to start accession talks with the European Commission.
"We cannot help but be conscious of the symbolism, at this time, of reaching out a hand to a country whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim," he said in a speech in Oxford on Monday (24 May).
In Ankara on Monday, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said preparations for implementation of the latest constitutional amendments would be completed rapidly, in order to speed up EU-related reforms and boost the likelihood of receiving an official invitation in December to begin accession negotiations with the Union.
He added that the government is determined not to provide any grounds for delaying the launch of accession talks.

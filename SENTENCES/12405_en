SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian newspaper reported Thursday (9 June) that the interior ministry of Republika Srpska and a special commission tasked with establishing the truth about Srebrenica have discovered that Serbian forces were involved in the 1995 massacre of Bosnian Muslims. 
According to the article in the Sarajevo-based Oslobodjenje, a joint police squad from the Republika Srpska, the now-defunct Republika Srpska Krajina and Serbia took part in the killings. 
It was under the command of Ljubomir Borovcanin, who is currently in The Hague awaiting trial. 
A Republika Srpska police spokesman denied the newspaper report later on Thursday.

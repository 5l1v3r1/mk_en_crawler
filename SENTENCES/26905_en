SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko is warning BiH officials that he will consider alternative measures to guarantee the inventory of state property unless the working group responsible for this does its job and collects the necessary documents.
Inzko said in a letter published Wednesday (August 5th) that one of these steps could be having his Office of the High Representative (OHR) conduct the inventory itself.
Bosnian Serb authorities oppose this option.

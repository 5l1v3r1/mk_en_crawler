PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Council of Europe (CoE) on Saturday (September 22nd) praised the talks among Montenegro's ruling parties and the opposition over the new constitution, but warned this alone is not enough to satisfy commitments undertaken as a member of the pan-European organisation.
Rapporteur Jean-Charles Gardetto noted that by joining the CoE, Montenegro is obliged to adopt its new constitution within a year and to adopt the organisation's ten conventions.
"My message both to the ruling party and to the opposition is that we are still waiting for you to take this step forward.
A lot has been done but there is still a lot to be done," Gardetto said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU must keep its word and launch accession talks with Turkey on Monday (3 October) as agreed, a Turkish government spokesman said Saturday. 
"Adding further conditions now would be a betrayal," he told reporters. 
His remarks came the day before an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers aimed at resolving a dispute with Austria over the European Commission's mandate for the upcoming talks.
Austria wants the negotiating framework to include the possibility of granting Ankara a privileged partnership instead of full membership -- an idea which Turkish leaders have repeatedly rejected. 
On Saturday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul again warned that his country would pull out of the negotiations if it is offered anything less than full membership.
Meanwhile, a poll conducted by the Milliyet newspaper found that support for the EU is falling rapidly in Turkey. 
Only 17.5 per cent of 1,834 people polled said they have confidence in the Union.

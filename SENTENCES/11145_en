BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister-designate Calin Popescu Tariceanu presented his new cabinet and government programme to parliament on Monday (27 December), saying that EU accession-related reforms and entry into the Union in 2007 would be the ministers' top priority.
Parliament is expected to vote soon on the proposed cabinet members, described by Tariceanu as a group of experts who entered politics following the collapse of the communist regime.
Most, he noted, have had successful business careers.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided on Thursday (February 18th) to resume hearings in the trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic next month. 
Karadzic is scheduled to make his opening statement on March 1st and 2nd. 
The defendant has repeatedly asked for postponements, saying he hasn't had time to prepare his defence. 
Although the court has not ruled on Karadzic's latest request, a judge said the trial could be postponed after opening statements. 
The trial began in October but was suspended almost immediately due to the defendant's refusal to attend the sessions.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Teodosije, the newly-elected Bishop of Raska and Prizren, was enthroned on Sunday (December 26th) at a ceremony in Prizren led by Serbian Patriarch Irinej.
"This is a great day, the day of the enthronement of a bishop who should help the Serbian Orthodox Church pursue its history and existence in Kosovo and instil people with new hope," Irinej said.
After the ceremony, Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic and Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic voiced hope that displaced Serbs will return to Prizren.
Meanwhile, the Vetevendosje movement criticised the government for allowing Serbian officials to enter Kosovo, saying Serbia keeps expanding its influence over Kosovo with the help of the outgoing cabinet.

TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha confirmed on Sunday (March 1st) that the government planned to apply for EU candidate status by June.
"Albania is now a changed country that is trustworthy and is able to fulfil its commitments," Basha told a meeting of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).
Last week, the EU warned Albania might have to postpone its application because of the global financial crisis.
In other news Sunday, the Democratic Alliance Party announced it would reach a coalition agreement with the DP before the June parliamentary elections.
The party aims to win six seats, said leader Neritan Ceka.
Separately Sunday, the interior ministry urged all citizens to apply for new IDs if they want to vote in June.
Voters must present either a passport or an electronic ID card at polling stations.
The deadline for applications is April 15th.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Four Turkish soldiers were killed and seven were wounded in a shootout with members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in southeast Turkey late Friday (April 30th).
It began with the rebels attacking a remote military outpost, firing machine guns, rockets and grenades.
Separately, a soldier was killed after he stepped on a mine believed to have been planted by the PKK in the town of Cukurca, in Hakkari province on Friday.
Parliament Speaker Mehmet Ali Sahin said on Saturday that the latest surge in attacks is targeting the government's intensified efforts to end terrorism.

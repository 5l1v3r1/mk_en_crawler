SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government announced on Friday (20 January) that it is processing four cases related to the 2001 interethnic conflict that were returned from the UN war crimes tribunal last year.
The statement explicitly dismissed allegations that there had been a secret deal to suspend any proceedings against former members and leaders of the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA).
The cases relate to the killings of 12 Macedonians from Tetovo, the kidnapping and torture of workers at a construction company, the NLA's closure of a dam at Lipkovo, and other incidents.

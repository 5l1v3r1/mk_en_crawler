BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government and the ruling coalition are stable, Democratic Party (DS) Deputy Chairman Dusan Petrovic said on Sunday (June 21st), adding the DS does not want early elections.
He said the government could fall only if one of the coalition partners decides to leave the alliance.
The comment came as the opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) said they will seek early elections over what they view as the government's inability to tackle the economic crisis, the Vojvodina status issue and Kosovo's independence.

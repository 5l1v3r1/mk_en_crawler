SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A former Bosnian Muslim general who was indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal died of a heart attack late Friday (7 March) in Sanski Most. 
Mehmed Alagic, 56, was one of the most senior officials to be charged by the tribunal. 
He was arrested in August 2001 and was subsequently released pending trial. 
He was indicted in connection with atrocities committed by troops under his control against Croat prisoners and civilians. 
The trial was expected to start later this year.
On Saturday meanwhile, a judge from the Zenica-Doboj Cantonal Court announced that Bosnian Serb war crimes indictee Tomo Mihajlovic surrendered voluntarily to local Zenica authorities. 
Federation of BiH authorities issued an indictment against him in 2000, accusing him of committing war crimes against non-Serbs in the area of Teslic in 1992, when Mihajlovic was a member of a paramilitary unit.

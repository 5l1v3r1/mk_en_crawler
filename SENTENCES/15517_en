BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Montenegrin opposition bloc favouring the preservation of a common state with Serbia has sent a letter to EU security chief Javier Solana, asking him to intervene in the independence referendum process, Solana's spokesperson Cristina Gallach confirmed on Monday (24 April). 
In the letter, the Socialist People's Party and its allies accused the pro-independence ruling coalition of provoking political tension ahead of the 21 May poll. 
Gallach said the EU would examine the letter's contents and that Solana's special envoy, Miroslav Lajcak, would visit Podgorica soon.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The army dismissed as premature Wednesday (December 23rd) media reports that two officers are under arrest in connection with plans to assassinate Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc.
The pair was arrested last Saturday, near Arinc's house.
In a statement Wednesday, the army said an investigation is ongoing, adding the two officers were released after their vehicles and homes were searched and no guns or voice recorders were found.
Nevertheless, authorities did confiscate computers and storage devices that may serve as evidence in the course of an official investigation into "a military official suspected of leaking information".
The media reports fuelled rumours of growing tension between the ruling Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party and the secularist army.

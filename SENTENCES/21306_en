THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal said on Wednesday (August 27th) it has charged former spokeswoman Florence Hartmann with contempt of court for allegedly disclosing confidential information about the trial of late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.
The tribunal ordered Hartmann to appear on September 15th to answer two counts of contempt of court.
If convicted, she could face up to seven years in prison, a fine of 100,000 euros, or both.
A court statement said a Hartmann text published in 2007 and 2008 disclosed information about confidential decisions by the appeals chamber in Milosevic's case.
Hartmann served as former chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte's spokeswoman from 1999 to 2006.

MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Several politicians from the Serb Ticket for Kosovo have decided to take their seats in parliament, though no agreement on this matter was reached within the coalition.
A local Kosovo Serb representative, Oliver Ivanovic, has warned that such a scenario would mark the end of the joint ticket.
The international community is urging Kosovo Serbs to protect their interests by ending their boycott of parliament.
But the Serbian government still favours the boycott.
In other news, Croatian President Stipe Mesic visited Pristina on Thursday, as part of his three-day visit to Serbia-Montenegro.
Following meetings with UNMIK officials and representatives of the local institutions, Mesic said the status issue should be resolved through direct talks between Pristina and Belgrade, with international community assistance.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska survived a no-confidence vote filled by the main opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) and the New Social Democratic Party over an incident in parliament.
The motion was rejected in a 69-14 vote late on Friday (July 30th).
Lawmakers from the ruling VMRO-DPMNE rejected the motion as ungrounded.
A week ago, the parliament established an inquiry committee to investigate the July 1st brawl that has strained relations between the opposition and the ruling majority.
The opposition SDSM accused police of intimidating their legislators and spying on their activities after a police agent tried to record their conversation with a group of disgruntled workers.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Dan Ioan Popescu, a senior official of the main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), announced on Monday (4 September) that he is leaving the party. 
Local media reports cited a letter Popescu sent to the PSD standing bureau, saying he no longer views PSD as a democratic party. 
A member of parliament, he stepped down from the PSD Bucharest executive post earlier this year amid embezzlement charges.

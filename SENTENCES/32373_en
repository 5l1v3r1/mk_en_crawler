BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A meeting of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is expected Friday (28 March) in Brussels. 
High Representative Paddy Ashdown and senior BiH representatives will attend the session, which will focus on progress made in implementing a reform agenda hammered out by Sarajevo and the PIC in September. 
Also likely to be discussed are the results of an investigation into illegal weapons sales to Iraq by Orao, a firm in Republika Srpska.
Ahead of the PIC meeting, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic met with chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, underscoring his government's readiness to co-operate fully with the tribunal. 
Del Ponte in turn signalled that the tribunal would hand over ten lower-level cases to the BiH State Court as soon as conditions are met.
In other news, Ashdown has removed Croat official Mijat Tuka from his post in the BiH Parliament, amid allegations that he embezzled funds while serving as deputy FBiH Minister for Refugees and Displaced Persons. 
Tuka's party, the New Croat Initiative, had refused to force him out of parliament.

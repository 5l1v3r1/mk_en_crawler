PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier said on Tuesday (December 2nd) the international community will not impose implementation of the six-point plan for deploying EULEX in Kosovo, which the UN Security Council adopted last week. 
"The six points contain ideas, certain suggestions, but their implementation requires an additional process," Zannier said, adding that Kosovo institutions can decide what is in Kosovo's interest and is in line with its constitution. 
Zannier also denied that the plan would lead to the partition of Kosovo.
About 4,000 people concerned with such a division staged a peaceful protest in Pristina on Tuesday against the six-point plan and EULEX's deployment.

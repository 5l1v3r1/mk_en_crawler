BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbia-Montenegro Parliament voted Friday (16 April) to appoint new ministers of defence, foreign affairs, and foreign economic relations.
The move was anticipated in the wake of the Serbian parliamentary election earlier this year.
Vuk Draskovic, 58, a veteran politician and leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, was appointed foreign minister.
In his first remarks to the lawmakers he said that Kosovo and closer ties with the EU and NATO would be his top priorities.
Prvoslav Davinic, 66, of the G-17 party, was elected minister of defence.
He is an expert in international law with considerable experience as a UN official.
The foreign economic relations portfolio went to Predrag Ivanovic, 50, of Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists.
Ivanovic is a professor of economics.
Draskovic told a local radio station shortly after his election that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is a "national obligation." He urged all war crime suspects, including four generals who were indicted recently, to surrender to the international court.

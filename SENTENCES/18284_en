ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's High Council for Combating Terrorism reportedly met late Tuesday (March 13th), to discuss security measures ahead of next week's celebrations marking Nevruz. 
The March 21st holiday is traditionally accompanied by Kurdish demonstrations. 
Local media reports say the ministers of foreign affairs, justice and interior attended, along with top army and security representatives and Turkey's special anti-terror envoy.
In other news, Turkish police raided the offices of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party and private homes in the southeast city of Tunceli on Wednesday. 
Officials said it was part of the government campaign against the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
Six people were arrested for suspected links to the PKK.

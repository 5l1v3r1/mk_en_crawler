BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors lodged an appeal Thursday (September 17th) before the Supreme Court against the acquittals of three former police officers, suspected of crimes committed in March 1999 in the Kosovo village of Suva Reka.
In April, the special war crimes court in Belgrade sentenced four former policemen to up to 20 years in prison, but acquitted three others for the killing of 48 Albanian civilians.
Prosecutors also want longer sentences for two of the four convicted men.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague has become more difficult following the acquittal last week of Ramush Haradinaj, Kosovo's former prime minister and former Kosovo Liberation Army commander, says Rasim Ljajic, head of the national council for war crimes co-operation.
While acknowledging on Thursday (April 10th) that Serbia must fully co-operate for the sake of eventual EU integration, he implied that the acquittal may weaken the commitment of those involved in hunting for fugitive war crimes indictees.
Separately, the Vecernje Novosti newspaper reported on Friday that EU foreign ministers will offer to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on April 28th.
The paper says President Boris Tadic will accept and insist that the Vienna convention gives him the right to sign international treaties.

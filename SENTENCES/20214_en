SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak called on authorities on Friday (March 14th) not to allow the building of a huge cross on a hill near Sarajevo, used by the Serb artillery for bombing the city during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
He described the plan as a "provocation" and urged building permit authorities to do what is necessary to prevent interethnic tensions. 
The plans have outraged many in Sarajevo, with the Association of War Victims condemning the idea as "immoral".

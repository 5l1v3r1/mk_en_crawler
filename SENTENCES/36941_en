ZAGREB, Croatia -- The asylum law was implemented Thursday (1 July), and was welcomed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR). 
The UNHCR says the law provides a good basis for establishing a national asylum procedure in accordance with Geneva Conventions and the UN Protocol on Status of Refugees. 
Under the law, Croatia will grant asylum to 150 asylum seekers annually.
In other news Wednesday, the OSCE reported significant progress in property restitution. 
Specifically, it said that from February to June, the Croatian Office for Refugee Return restored over 100 of the 195 houses in the Petrinja region to their owners.
Meanwhile, the EU has put five Croatian citizens on its "black list" of people banned from entering Union countries. 
Zeljko Bagic, Ljubo Cesic, Zeljko Dilber, Ante Maksan and Hrvoje Petrac were added to the list amid suspicions they are involved in hiding war crimes indictees.

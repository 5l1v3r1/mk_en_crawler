SOFIA, Bulgaria â Thousands gathered in front of Alexander Nevskiy Cathedral in downtown Sofia on Saturday (May 12th) to pray for five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor on death row in Libya.
It was the largest rally ever organised by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and, for the first time, Bulgaria's three miracle icons of St. Mary were displayed together in Sofia.
A Libyan court sentenced the nurses to death last December after finding them guilty of infecting more than 400 children with HIV.
Leading international experts have testified, however, that the disease had spread long before the nurses were hired.
The United States and the EU have called for the release of the medics.
The family of the Palestinian is asking Bulgaria to make him a citizen, since, as a Palestinian refugee in Libya, no state or organisation represents his interests.

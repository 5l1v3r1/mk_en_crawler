PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX police officers raided the offices of four companies Tuesday (January 18th) in relation to corruption involving the transport and telecommunications ministry.
Searches were conducted in Prishtine/Pristina, Peje/Pec and Prizren.
A EULEX pre-trial judge of the District Court of Prishtine/Pristina authorised the searches.
In another investigation related to suspicious tenders in the municipality of Gjilan/Gnjilane, the EULEX Police Executive Department raided the offices of two companies.
Ministry officials said that they have no information about these actions, nor they were contacted by EULEX concerning them.
The Kosovo police were not part of these raids.
A EULEX spokesperson said the searches are a continuation of investigations into the case of former Transport and Telecommunications Minister Fatmir Limaj.
Last year, EULEX raided the ministry's premises and private houses of ministry officials regarding suspected violations involving road tenders.
So far, only Limaj and the procurement officer are under investigation for money laundering, organised crime, abuse of office and bribery.

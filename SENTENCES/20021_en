SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ivan Ivanov, deputy director of the police division for the fight against organised crime, was arrested on Tuesday (March 18th) on charges of corruption and supplying confidential information to those under investigation. 
Ivanov reportedly tipped alcohol producers about ongoing investigations into excise tax fraud. 
The opposition responded by demanding the resignation of Interior Minister Rumen Petkov, as well as the chief secretary of the interior ministry, Valentin Petrov. 
The case is perceived as a test of the government's commitment to fighting high-level corruption.

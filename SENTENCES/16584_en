BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government refuted on Wednesday (10 May) allegations that mentally ill and handicapped children are being mistreated, confined to adult mental institutions in deplorable conditions. 
The accusations were raised in a recent report by the US-registered group Mental Disability Rights International after an 18-month investigation. 
The NGO's report urged the EU to press Romania to remedy the situation. 
Next week, the European Commission is to recommend whether Romania should be allowed to join the EU in 2007, as scheduled.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A 20 year-old woman was injured in a bomb explosion in the Mediterranean city of Mersin on Wednesday (30 August), the latest in a series of bombings that have left three people dead and injured dozens in Marmaris, Antalya, and Istanbul.
In Wednesday's incident, the bomb was placed in a garbage bin.
One arrest has been made.
While no group has claimed responsibility, authorities believe it -- like the others -- was the work of Kurdish extremists.
Meanwhile, members of the European Parliament, headed by Dutch conservative representative Camiel Eurlings, are writing a report and draft resolution on Turkey's progress towards EU membership.
The 11-page draft criticises the level of progress achieved in several areas, specifically freedom of expression and religious freedom.
In other news, the Turkish Air Force announced plans to buy 30 F-16 fighter planes from US firm Lockheed Martin.
All aircraft will be purchased by 2011.

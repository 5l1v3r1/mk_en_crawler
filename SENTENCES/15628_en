TIRANA, Albania -- Members of parliament from the Socialist Party (SP)-led opposition coalition demanded on Thursday (21 September) that Prime Minister Sali Berisha resign over a recent scandal over the local air carrier Albatros, whose flights have been suspended. 
SP leader Edi Rama says Berisha deliberately targeted Albatros Airways, which is co-owned by a nephew of President Alfred Moisiu, to pressure the president to dismiss the country's chief prosecutor, Theodhori Sollaku. 
The DP accuses Sollaku of links to organised crime.

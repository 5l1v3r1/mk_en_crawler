BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu urged the government Tuesday (14 October) to replace two ministers, recently linked to corruption and plagiarism scandals. 
Iliescu said that keeping Minister of EU Integration Hildegard Puwak and Healthcare Minister Mircea Beuran in the cabinet does not benefit Romania's overall image. 
Puwak is being investigated on suspicion of embezzling EU funds, while Beuran's name has surfaced in a scandal related to the plagiarising of a Romanian university textbook from Western sources.

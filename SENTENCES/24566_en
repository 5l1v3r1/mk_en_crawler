TIRANA, Albania -- The interior ministry is urging citizens to apply for electronic ID cards before Monday (January 12th), which is the government set deadline. 
Deputy Interior Minister Ferdinand Poni said on Thursday that all those who fail to apply will lose access to public services and privileges until they obtain the new IDs. 
In particular, he mentioned public employees, pensioners and students as groups that would suffer most from the possible sanctions. 
The government's goal is to complete the process before the end of June, when observers expect general elections to occur.

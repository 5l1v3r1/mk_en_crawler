BERLIN, Germany -- Prosecutors announced on Tuesday (March 31st) they have charged a suspected leading member of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) with arson and membership in a terror organisation.
Authorities say the man, identified only as Aslan Y., was a PKK leader in southern Germany between 1993 and 1994.
He allegedly ordered "countless attacks", including seven episodes of arson in 1993 targeting Turkish and German clubs, restaurants and businesses.
One person died from the attacks.
In other news on Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkish authorities did not violate the human rights of a detainee who died while in custody in 2001.
Muharrem Horoz, who faced charges of committing various terrorist acts on behalf of an illegal organisation, died after staging a hunger strike to protest prison conditions.
Horoz's mother claimed judicial authorities violated his right to life in refusing to free him, contrary to the opinion of doctors who recommended his release.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias said on Tuesday (September 30th) he is ready to open Greek Cypriot ports and airports to commercial activities run by the administration in the northern, Turkish part of the divided island.
"We offer our compatriot Cypriot Turks who wish to export and import goods the chance to trade through the ports and airports of the Republic of Cyprus," he told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).
He also urged the UN to press on with an agreement to abolish annual military exercises held separately by Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot forces on the island.
He said he discussed this last week in New York with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
In other news, Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are nominees -- along with four other candidates -- for European Man of the Year.
European Voice, a newspaper that covers EU affairs, gives the award annually.

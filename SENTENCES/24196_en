TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Tuesday (July 14th) the proposed coalition between his Democratic Party and the Socialist Party for Integration will work for Albania's EU accession.
"The agreed partnership didn't aim to keep us in power, but to integrate Albania into Europe," he stressed.
The coalition has set a precedent in Albanian politics as two fierce rivals from different ends of the political spectrum joined forces to govern.
Berisha also accused main opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama of contesting the vote-counting process rather than accepting defeat in the June 28th elections.

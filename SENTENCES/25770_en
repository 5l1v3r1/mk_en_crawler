TIRANA, Albania -- Miners began a strike Saturday (February 20th), demanding that the government give them a specific labour status offering higher pensions and earlier retirement, at age 50 instead of 60.
They also insist that a planned increase in energy prices should be cancelled.
At the start of the action, protesters gathered outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office in Tirana, in an attempt to meet with him.
That led to clashes with police in which several miners were injured.
Their unions say they will continue the strike until their demands are met.

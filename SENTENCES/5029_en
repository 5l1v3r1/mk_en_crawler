The 49th annual Sibenik Children's Festival was held in Sibenik, Croatia from June 20th to July 4th.
Over 1,100 participants from 21 countries performed during the two-week event, spilling out of theatres and organised venues, and spreading joy throughout the streets of Sibenik.
Performers turned up from Italy, Austria, Poland, the US, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, the UK, Romania, Russia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Argentina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, and, of course, Croatia.
"Kids from around the globe feel the same.
It does not matter what language they speak, they still feel the same, they still love the same things," said Dina Telem, head of the Israeli dance group Dina Telem.
Despite hard financial times in Croatia, the festival gave both children and adults a reason to smile.
"The International Children's Festival is the soul of the city of Sibenik, something Sibenik must be proud of.
People remember Sibenik because of this event," said Goran Pauk, prefect of Sibenik-Knin County.
"I only regret that the event lasts just two weeks.
[The festival] is a great thing for the city.
I'd prefer having it for two or three months," said Sibenik Mayor Ante Zupanovic.
"The festival has had many troubles, but it always emerges stronger, it brings the joy and play of the children onto the streets of Sibenik, and that's something we want to keep having in the future," he added.
This year's festival supported a national campaign against child abuse, and organised workshops under the slogan "punishing the kids is punishing the future".
The Sibenik festival promotes culture and friendship among children worldwide.
"This is great.
We meet children from many countries.
We do not understand what they say in their languages, but we can still play the same games with them, we can enjoy watching them dance, sing, draw ...
I'll try to participate next time," said seven-year-old Damir Covic.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Interior Ministry has filed criminal charges against Bogoljub Karic for abuse of office and fraud, according to a ministry statement Saturday (18 February). 
The former majority owner of the wireless operator Mobtel, Karic is accused of having caused damages of over 16.7m euros to the state. 
He fled Serbia before an official arrest warrant was issued. 
Contacting local media on Sunday, he refused to say whether he would return.
Karic, who heads the Power of Serbia Movement, insists the charges are politically motivated.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (July 3rd) overturned the conviction of Naser Oric, commander of Muslim forces in Srebrenica from 1992 until 1995. 
Two years ago, The Hague tribunal sentenced him to two years in prison for failing to prevent troops under his command from committing war crimes against Serb civilians in Srebrenica, well before the infamous massacre there. 
The appeals court ordered his immediate release Wednesday, given the length of time he has spent in custody. 
Oric, 41, enjoys a heroic reputation among many Bosniaks for trying to defend Srebrenica from advancing Bosnian Serb forces in 1995.

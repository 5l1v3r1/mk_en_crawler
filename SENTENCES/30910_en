ANKARA, Turkey -- Students staged a protest Wednesday (December 8th) against excessive force used by police during a student demonstration at the weekend. 
TV footage showed youth throwing eggs and toilet paper at Burhan Kuzu, a senior lawmaker with the ruling Justice and Development Party. 
Aides shielded him with umbrellas as he made his way out of a conference at the political science faculty of Ankara University.
On Saturday, students had protested Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he met with a group of university rectors to discuss higher education reform, a move denounced by the students. 
Police used pepper spray and clubs to disperse some in the crowd who had turned violent, dragging some away.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic dismissed criticism Wednesday (1 June) by the international community, following the RS Parliament's rejection of an EU-backed proposal for police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The EU has indicated that by blocking police reform, RS is delaying the start of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between BiH and the Union.
On Wednesday, the internationally appointed interim administrator of Privredna Banka in Eastern Sarajevo, Toby Robinson, demanded that the RS banking agency block the accounts of SDS.
Robinson says the party was behind a 1999 financial scandal that led to the theft of money belonging to depositors.

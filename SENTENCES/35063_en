BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police say they failed to arrest a Serb war crimes suspect despite two raids Sunday (27 June).
Officers searched premises in the villages of Maslovare and Knexevo at dawn, looking for Stojan Zupljanin, who is being sought by the UN tribunal for genocide and war crimes.
On the run for nearly three years, he commanded police stations in northern BiH during the 1992-1995 conflict.
A similar action Saturday in the village of Celebici failed to net another war crimes suspect, Savo Todorovic.
In other news, international auditors have found a number of irregularities in the finances of Republika Srpska's ruling Serb Democratic Party, according to local media, who cited an auditors' report submitted to the Office of the High Representative (OHR).
The OHR ordered the audit in May.
According to the audit, which covered last year and January to April of this year, misappropriations totalled millions of Bosnian marks.

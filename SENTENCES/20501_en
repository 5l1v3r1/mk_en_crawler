ANKARA, Turkey -- Two members of Turkey's gendarmerie -- a paramilitary force policing rural areas -- have been indicted on charges of abuse of power in connection with the murder of Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink.
Turkish media reported that a relative of Dink's killer approached the gendarmerie with information that his nephew was planning the murder.
Orgun Samast, the 17-year-old gunman, and 18 others are already on trial for Dinkâs murder.
Turkish nationalists were against Dink's statements characterizing the killing of Armenians during World War I as genocide.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis announced changes in his government Wednesday (January 7th) in an attempt to regain public trust amid growing criticism of its economic and social policies. 
Despite calls for the removal of Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos after extended rioting last month, Pavlopoulos is retaining his post. 
Also keeping their jobs are Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, National Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis, Health Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos, Merchant Marine Minister Anastassis Papaligouras and Employment Minister Fani Palli-Petralia.
But National Economy and Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis will give way to his deputy, Yiannis Papathanassiou. 
Former Transport and Communications Minister Costis Hatzidakis will take up the development ministry. 
Former Tourism Minister Aris Spiliotopoulos will be in charge of education, while former Education Minister Evrypides Stylianidis will take the lead at the transport and communications ministry. 
Lawmaker Nikos Dendias will head the justice ministry and his predecessor, Sotiris Hatzigakis, will become agriculture minister. 
Observers expect the cabinet's swearing-in on Thursday.

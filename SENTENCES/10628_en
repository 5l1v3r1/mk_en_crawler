BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR released Bosnian Serb Veljko Borovina from detention Thursday (9 September).
Borovina, a cousin of suspected war crimes indictee supporter Milovan Cicko Bjelica, was arrested on 31 August in Sokolac.
He was suspected of involvement in activities undermining the Dayton Peace Accords.
After his release, Borovina told local media that he was interrogated about events from 1992-1998, when he was Bjelica's chauffeur.
Bjelica, arrested around the same time, remains in custody.

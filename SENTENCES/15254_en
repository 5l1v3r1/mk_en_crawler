BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn wraps up two days of meetings in Belgrade on Tuesday (30 May), where he has assured officials that a revised mandate for negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia will be adopted, in light of the independence referendum in Montenegro. 
Rehn added that SAA talks could be concluded by the end of this year if Serbia demonstrates full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The co-operation issue derailed SAA talks with Belgrade earlier this month. 
Rehn travelled to Belgrade from Podgorica.

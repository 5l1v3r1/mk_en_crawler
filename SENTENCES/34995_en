BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Macedonia will submit its application for EU membership by the end of February, Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva said on Tuesday (9 December) on the sidelines the EU-Western Balkans summit in Brussels.
She said the government considers the country stable and would therefore ignore the discouraging comments from the EU suggesting a premature bid might be rejected.
In response, senior EU officials -- including the External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten -- urged Macedonia to focus instead on accelerating reforms and implementation of the Ohrid Peace Agreement.

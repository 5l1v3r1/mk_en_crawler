BUCHAREST, Romania -- Moldovan authorities have refused to accredit Mihnea Constantinescu as Romania's new ambassador to Chisinau, Romania's foreign ministry said in a statement Friday (April 24th).
The ministry named Constantinescu to the post on April 8th, after the previous ambassador, Filip Teodorescu, received an expulsion notice from Moldovan authorities.
Chisinau accuses Bucharest of interfering in the country's domestic affairs by backing riots that broke out in the beginning of April.
Thousands of protestors stormed Moldova's parliament and presidential offices to dispute the results of parliamentary elections that returned the Communist Party to power.
Moldova rejected Constantinescu without any explanation, the ministry said.

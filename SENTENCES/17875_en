SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The State Investigation and Protection Agency have arrested two Bosnian Muslims, suspected of war crimes against Bosnian Croats. 
Arrested at two different locations in central Bosnia on Monday (April 16th) were Senad Dautovic, 47, and Enes Handzic, 44. 
They have been charged with perpetrating crimes against civilians in the town of Bugojno between 1992 and 1994.
In other news Monday, Sarajevo's war crimes court sentenced a Bosnian Serb man to five and a half years in prison for the repeated rape of a Muslim woman during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Radmilo Vukovic was found guilty of committing war crimes against civilians in Foca in 1992. 
The court did not impose the mandatory ten-year sentence because it acknowledged the existence of mitigating circumstances, including an affair between Vukovic and his victim before the war.

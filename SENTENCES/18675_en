SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leaders of the ruling and opposition parties met on Friday (July 6th) to restart stalled judicial reforms, but the talks failed over disagreements on the mandate of public prosecutors.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, said the main problem remains the criteria for appointing and re-electing prosecutors.
Restructuring the judiciary is a main condition set by both NATO and the EU for integration.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors on Sunday (September 27th) backed an initiative to establish a regional truth commission (RECOM) regarding war crimes and other serious human rights violations committed in the former Yugoslavia.
The prosecutors also back efforts to allow cameras in courtrooms so victims and their families see how justice is applied.
Representatives of the coalition for RECOM -- a network of NGOs, associations and individuals who advocate the establishment of the panel, consulted with journalists about the initiative Saturday in Novi Sad.

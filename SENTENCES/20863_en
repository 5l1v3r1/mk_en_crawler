BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, leading to the arrest and extradition of Ratko Mladic and other fugitives, is the main condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated on Wednesday (September 5th). 
During a joint press conference with Rehn in Brussels, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said Serbia is determined to meet all its obligations towards the tribunal, with an eye to initialling an SAA next month.
While in Brussels, Jeremic also met with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and presented a document outlining goals in the light of membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme. 
Ties with the Alliance grew somewhat strained recently, after members of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's party suggested that NATO has a hidden agenda for Kosovo.

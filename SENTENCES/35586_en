SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The reopening of the energy chapter of Bulgaria-EU talks would only delay the country's accession to the Union, Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Monday (7 June) in Sofia. 
He stressed that the EU member countries have no intention of reopening any chapters that have already been closed. 
His comment was in response to efforts to renegotiate the decommissioning deadlines for the third and fourth units of the Kozloduy nuclear plant.
In other news, the newspaper24 Chasa reported on Tuesday that the FBI plans to open an office in Sofia in one month. 
Interior ministry sources say it will function as an anti-terror centre.

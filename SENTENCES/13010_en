SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Rumen Petkov announced on Wednesday (28 September) plans to restore the practice of deploying undercover police officers at state institutions and public enterprises, in order to enhance the fight against corruption.
The practice was suspended in 1997.
Petkov met with the chiefs of regional police departments to discuss legislative changes regarding the use of special surveillance means.
It was also announced Wednesday that Iliya Iliev, current head of the National Police Service, will succeed Boyko Borissov in the post of interior ministry chief secretary.
Borissov resigned to run for mayor of Sofia next month.
In other news, Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski said on Wednesday that Bulgaria is considering writing off 80 per cent of Iraq's debt.
He pointed out that the Paris Club of creditor nations has already adopted a similar decision.
Oresharski's comment was the first sign of a shift in policy regarding Iraq's $1.7 billion debt.

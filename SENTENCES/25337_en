PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Monday (October 26th) accused Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of turning Kosovo's Public Broadcaster, the RTK, into a "media arm of the ruling party". 
EBU head Jean Reveillon sent a letter to Thaci saying that the RTK faces political and economic interference from the government.
"What we are now seeing is pressure from the Kosovo government to turn RTK into an uncritical state broadcaster -- a fact that will be beneficial neither to the citizens of Kosovo nor to your ambitions for more international recognition of your country," Reveillon wrote. 
His letter went on to say that since Kosovo declared independence in February 2008, interference has grown and led to the resignation of RTK's general director in September. 
The EBU represents 125 national broadcasters and promotes public service media in Europe and around the world.

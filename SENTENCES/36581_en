BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian police have not yet provided any information about where Milorad "Legija" Lukovic hid in the 14 months between Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's March 2003 assassination and his surprise surrender earlier this week, according to local press reports Wednesday (5 May). 
His lawyer says the suspected mastermind of the assassination was "hiding" in his home after police asked him to stay out of the public eye. 
But Rajko Danilovic, the lawyer for the Djindjic family, disputes that, saying it is important to understand who has been protecting Lukovic.

TIRANA, Albania -- The annulment of a maritime border agreement with Greece is damaging Albania, says Vangjel Dule, leader of the opposition Party Union for Human Rights. 
"The decision [by the Constitutional Court in Tirana] damages the image of the country, and its negotiations credibility. 
We support an open Albania, which partners with NATO countries and is ready for partnership in the EU," said Dule on Wednesday (February 3rd). 
Earlier this month the court annulled the agreement with Greece, delineating the continental shelf and maritime borders between the two countries in the Ionian Sea.

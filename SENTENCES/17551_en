TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha and his visiting Bulgarian counterpart, Sergey Stanishev, suggested on Monday (January 29th) that the EU consider reopening two older units at Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear power plant, given the prospect of a regional energy crisis. 
Units 3 and 4 were shut down due to safety concerns on December 31st, in line with Bulgaria's pre-accession commitments to the Union. 
"We still call upon the European Commission and the EU to re-evaluate this obligation which in fact damages the regional energy market more than it damages Bulgaria itself," Berisha told a news conference Monday. 
Albania has been hard hit by energy shortages this winter.
Berisha and Stanishev also discussed bilateral and regional collaboration. 
Stanishev reaffirmed Sofia's readiness to back Albania's efforts to join the EU and NATO. 
As part of the visit, several co-operation agreements were sealed.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Hundreds of state-employed scientists protested in Sofia on Wednesday (November 3rd) against proposed budget cuts.
They marched to the government building and demanded the resignations of Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov and Education Minister Sergei Ignatov, threatening to close facilities unless their demands are met.
The scientists want more money for their institutions and immediate back pay they are owed.

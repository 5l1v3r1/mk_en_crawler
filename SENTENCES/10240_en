ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament met in an extraordinary session Sunday (26 September) to adopt a new penal code that would comply with EU law.
Lawmakers nearly passed the legislation earlier this month, when they went into a recess following a dispute over a clause that would have outlawed adultery.
Observers anticipate no problems for the bill now that plans to insert the controversial provision have been dropped.
Lawmakers will try to get the bill approved by 1 October, five days before the European Commission publishes its crucial progress report on Turkey.
EU leaders will use this report to decide whether to launch accession talks with Ankara in 2005.

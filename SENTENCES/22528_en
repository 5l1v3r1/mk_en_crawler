TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) proposed on Wednesday (April 9th) three substantial changes to the constitution. 
The first pertains to presidential elections and decrees. 
The second involves no-confidence motions, while the third proposal limits the mandate of the general prosecutor. 
The opposition Socialist Party (SP) did not comment on the proposals, saying it would hold consultations first.
Meanwhile, leaders of three opposition parties, the Party of Social Democracy's Paskal Milo, the Socialist Movement for Integration's Ilir Meta, and the Democratic Alliance's Neritan Ceka, gathered on Wednesday to discuss an SP initiative to amend the constitution, changing the electoral system to a regional proportional one.

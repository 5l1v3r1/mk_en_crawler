THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will appear at The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) on April 13th for the resumption of his trial, a member of Karadzic's defence team, Peter Robinson, said on Saturday (April 3rd).
According to Robinson, Karadzic plans to participate fully in the hearings.
On Thursday, the ICTY Appeals Chamber turned down the former Bosnian Serb leader's request to delay his trial until June.
Radovan Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

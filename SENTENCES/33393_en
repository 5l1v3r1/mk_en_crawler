STRASBOURG, France -- Turkey's secular and democratic model defies the "clash of civilisations", Turkish National Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said Monday (2 June) at the general assembly session of the European Security and Defence Assembly in Strasbourg.
The defence minister pointed out that Turkey has close political, economic and cultural connections with Western Europe and is a historical part of the old continent.
Gonul also said that Turkish society and government were determined to prove they are capable of developing a democratic, transparent, pluralist and modern country.
In other news, Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan told reporters Monday that the government has raised its projections for this year's current account deficit to $6.1 billion from $3.7 billion.
He attributed the change to the appreciation of the lira, higher spending by the public sector and lower revenues from tourism.
The minister said Turkey is successfully implementing the IMF-backed recovery program and expects $500m in loans by the end of June.

TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers on Thursday (18 May) approved the members of the parliamentary ad-hoc committee on electoral reform. 
The 18-member staff will consider the necessary legal amendments over the next three months, based on recommendations by the OSCE, which monitored last year's general election. 
Electoral reform is a condition set by the OSCE and other international organisations for Albania's membership in NATO and the EU.

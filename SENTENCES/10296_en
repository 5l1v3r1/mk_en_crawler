ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia is hosting a two-day conference on regional governance in Southeast Europe beginning Monday (25 October).
The event, titled "Efficient Democratic Administration at Local and Regional Levels", has been organised by the government in co-operation with the Council of Europe and the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe.
Talks will focus on ways to improve local administration, developing institutional and taxation frameworks, prospects for national associations of local authorities, the role of the central government in building democratic institutions and the importance of the international community's assistance in the process.
In other news, the Vukovar County Court launched an investigation on Sunday against a 29-year-old man who is suspected of attacking the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) office in Vukovar by throwing a hand grenade outside the premises last Wednesday.
Two HSP members were slightly injured in the incident.

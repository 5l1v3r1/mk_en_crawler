BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament approved the 2010 state budget law in a 192-138 vote Thursday (January 14th), effectively maintaining the framework proposed by the government.
It includes a series of unpopular measures, such as wage and pension freezes and public sector layoffs.
By a margin of 176 to 147, lawmakers voted in favour of the budget for social security.
Efforts by the opposition to boost pensions failed, so rates will continue to reflect commitments made to the IMF.
Also Thursday, Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu said personnel cuts in the public sector will amount to over 100,000 jobs in the next four years.
This year, nearly 17,000 jobs will be trimmed, mostly in local government.
Trade unions vowed to stage protests later this month.
Union leader Bogdan Hossu says the finance ministry "is looking at the issue from a purely accounting perspective, without consideration for increased efficiency".

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague should remain open until all fugitives are arrested and prosecuted, tribunal President Fausto Pocar said on Monday (May 19th).
Kicking off a three-day visit to BiH by meeting with Presidency member Zeljko Komsic, Pocar said that the tribunal will work to help local authorities process war crimes cases.
Komsic said BiH is committed to co-operating with the UN tribunal.
In other news Monday, High Representative in BiH Miroslav Lajcak went before the UN Security Council in New York and said the country is poised to move forward, despite the differing goals of various political parties.
He acknowledged that nationalistic rhetoric undermines progress at times, but said there is pragmatism too.
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric delivered a speech as well, saying constitutional reform should be the result of compromise and consensus reached within BiH, rather than outside pressures.

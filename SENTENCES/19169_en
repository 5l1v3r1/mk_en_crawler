SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency of BiH approved the 2008 state budget bill on Wednesday (January 30th). 
The Croat and Bosniak members -- Zeljko Komsic and Haris Silajdzic -- supported the draft, while Serb member Nebojsa Radmanovic voted against it. 
Silajdzic told reporters the measure involves total budget spending of 630m euros, 20.5m euros more than in the first draft prepared in December. 
The expenditure of state institutions would amount to 496m euros, while 133.5m euros would service foreign debt. 
In a comment published on the presidency website, Radmanovic said the draft spending measure was "unreal" and warned it would threaten fiscal stability.

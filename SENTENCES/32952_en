PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK head Michael Steiner announced he would step down from his post Monday (30 June), saying it would make no sense for him to initiate upcoming dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina only to have his successor complete it. 
The German publication <I>Berliner Zeitung</I> reports his successor would be Italian diplomat Antonio Armellini, who is currently working on anti-terrorism issues.

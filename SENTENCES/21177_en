SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Facing war crimes charges, former Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic had a "not guilty" plea entered on his behalf Thursday (January 31st).
It had to be entered by a judge after Klickovic refused to do so himself, explaining that his defence remains incomplete due to a court error.
Judge Saban Maksumic said the plea could not be delayed, as has happened twice before, for the same reason.
Klickovic is the highest-ranking member of former Republika Srpska President Radovan Karadzic's administration to stand trial.
Banja Luka accuses him of abuse of office and of embezzling funds from the entity's budget from 1997 to 1998, to help war crimes fugitives.
He is also charged in connection with abetting murders and the deportation of civilians in the northwest Krajina region from 1990 to 1992.

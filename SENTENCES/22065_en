BELGRADE, Serbia -- No official in Serbia knows where the remaining Hague war crimes fugitives are hiding, the head of Serbia's national council for ties with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Sunday (July 20th) in an interview with Tanjug. 
"We don't say that the three indictees -- Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic and Goran Hadzic -- are not in Serbia, but we cannot say with 100% certainty that they are in the country," Ljajic said. 
"This is not a question of Serbia looking for an alibi; the fact is that there is no actual reason for us not to arrest the three," Ljajic explained, recalling that Serbia has handed over 43 indictees to The Hague, including senior military, police and political officials.
Separately Sunday, Republika Srpska police head Uros Pena denied that Karadzic, Mladic and Hadzic are in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
"At this moment it is certain that none of the three war crimes fugitives ... 
is on the territory of BiH," Pena told the Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz.

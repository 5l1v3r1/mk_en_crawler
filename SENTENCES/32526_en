ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Commissioner for External Relations Christopher Patten will arrive in Zagreb on Wednesday (12 March) for a two-day visit. 
He will be discussing Croatia's application for EU membership and may also tackle Croatia's relations with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Monday meanwhile, Prime Minister Ivica Racan told reporters that international arbitration on the nuclear agreement with Slovenia remains an option. 
The parliaments of the two countries ratified an agreement last year, but Croatia says Slovenia has failed to fulfil all clauses stemming from joint ownership of the Krsko nuclear plant.

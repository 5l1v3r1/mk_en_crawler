ATHENS, Greece -- The credit rating agency Moody's on Monday (June 14th) downgraded Greece's government bonds four notches to "junk" status amid continuing "considerable uncertainty" about the impact of measures to reduce the huge budget deficit. 
Despite lowering the rating from A3 to Ba1, Moody's said the risk of default is low. 
At the same time, the outlook on Greece's rating was defined as stable, which means virtually no movement is expected during the next 12-18 months. 
The government said the downgrade in no way reflects "the progress achieved over the past months or the prospects opening up from fiscal restructuring".

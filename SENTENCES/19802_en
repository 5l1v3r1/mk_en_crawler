BRUSSELS, Belgium -- At the latest round of direct talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders in Brussels on Tuesday (November 20th), Serbia's negotiating team suggested the province's future could be modelled after the Aland Islands -- a Swedish-speaking, autonomous part of Finland.
The Serbian side also suggested that a deal on broad autonomy should be limited to 20 years.
Belgrade would retain control over foreign policy and borders, but would stay out of Kosovo politics.
Monetary and customs policies would be issues of co-operation.
Kosovo would essentially become a demilitarized zone, although the international community would maintain a temporary presence.
Kosovo Albanian negotiators flatly turned down the proposal, saying again that they want complete independence from Serbia.
President Fatmir Sejdiu, however, seemed to back away from warnings about a unilateral declaration of independence, saying his side would "co-ordinate each and every step with the international community".

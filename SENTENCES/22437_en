SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia (SSM) is organising a massive protest Friday (November 14th) in downtown Skopje against legislative amendments that workers fear will drastically reduce their rights.
It comes a week after a warning strike organised by the SSM, whose members -- among other things -- demand higher living standards and a minimum wage set by law.
The Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia backs the protest and is urging its supporters to turn out.

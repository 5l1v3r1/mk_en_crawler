SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Economic police raided the headquarters of the state-run tobacco holding company Bulgartabac in Sofia on Wednesday (May 16th), and seized documentation as part of an embezzlement investigation. 
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Sofia City Prosecutor Nikolay Kokinov said that the action, which was ordered by his institution, prevented hiding and manipulation of important documents. 
According to local media, the confiscated documents were related to the latest audit of Bulgartabac, which unveiled a number of irregularities, and could be used as evidence in future indictments. 
The holding company has been involved in the recent corruption probe, which has resulted in the implication of high-ranking government and investigation officials.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Major world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany -- gathered with Iran on Friday (January 21st) in Istanbul for another round of talks over Tehran's controversial nuclear programme. 
Ahead of the two-day meeting, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Washington may propose new unilateral sanctions on Iran. 
Russia says unilateral sanctions could be counter-productive. 
"It would be an important first step if a nuclear fuel swap deal was implemented," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said after meeting with Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu in Istanbul.
Under such a deal Tehran would give up certain amount of its low-enriched uranium in return of fuel for a research reactor. 
The latest uranium-for-fuel swap deal was proposed by Brazil and Turkey last May but did not receive the backing of the West.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker says Kosovo institutions are "mature enough for the settling of Kosovo's status".
During a press conference Sunday (January 13th), Ruecker declined to be more specific on what would happen to Kosovo, but did express hope a solution would be found shortly.
He added that in his speech Wednesday to the UN Security Council in New York, he would acknowledge Kosovo's achievements in meeting international standards, but would stress that further progress would depend on the status issue.
Meanwhile, in an interview Saturday with the Ljubljana-based daily Dnevnik, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said Serbia lost Kosovo a long time ago.
He traced it to removing Kosovo's autonomy and applying Milosevic's despotism to Kosovo Albanians.

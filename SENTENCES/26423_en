SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov is backing away from a proposal to raise health insurance contributions by 2% to 10%, looking instead at an alternative plan to boost funding for the health care system, local media reported on Sunday (March 14th). 
The new option is for the government to stop paying the social and health insurance contributions of civil servants, starting in April. 
According to the newspaper Sega, about 150,000 public sector employees would be affected by the measure, which would cut budget expenses by around 70m euros.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The state Anti-corruption Commission adopted an addendum on local government Tuesday (21 June) to the programme aimed at preventing and eliminating corruption.
The commission said approval of the document was necessary, in light of the decentralisation process scheduled to start on 1 July.
Commission chief Dragan Malinovski, meanwhile, is complaining of a lack of direct communication with Public Prosecutor Aleksander Prcevski.
In an interview with the daily Vecer published Wednesday, Malinovski said the commission enjoys normal communication with every other relevant institution but the public prosecutor's office.

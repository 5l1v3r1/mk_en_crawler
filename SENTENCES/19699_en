BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (November 21st) criticised a new bill that would establish a majority voting system and sent it to the Constitutional Court for consideration, saying it violates some basic constitutional principles. 
Romanians will vote on the proposed majority system in a referendum Sunday. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu dismissed Basescu's move as "regrettable" and a last ditch effort to block the bill.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Miodrag Zivkovic, the leader of the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro, reportedly says he will go to jail rather than pay a fine for libelling Montenegro's Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. 
Belgrade-based news agency B92 reported on Sunday (18 July) that Zivkovic opted for the six-month sentence, rather than the fine of 8,000 euros. 
Earlier this month, a court ruled that the politician had libelled Djukanovic, though the judge excluded evidence presented by the defence.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte still views Belgrade's level of co-operation as insufficient, according to her spokesperson, Florence Hartmann.
At a news conference Tuesday (22 November) in The Hague, Hartmann said del Ponte was "surprised" by recent media reports in Belgrade.
They suggested del Ponte would acknowledge improved co-operation in her next report on Serbia-Montenegro, which is to be submitted to the UN Security Council by the end of November.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday that it would consider splitting the trial of Slobodan Milosevic to speed up the proceedings.
The judges may decide to issue a separate verdict for the part of the trial dealing with war crimes in Kosovo.
Milosevic has spent nearly 75 per cent of the total 360 courtroom hours allotted to him addressing the Kosovo charges and has yet to present his defence on charges relating to the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

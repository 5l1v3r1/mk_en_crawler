SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov made a speech on Sunday (January 27th) and unveiled a broad new political agenda that included an appeal for a mixed electoral system with stronger majority vote and increasing the president's authorities. 
The president said that the new adgenda would lead to a more adequate political representation, which would limit vote-buying and populism. 
He also backed tightening the voter registration process and party registration requirements, which would eventually reduce the number of political parties. 
Parvanov requested that he be authorised to initiate referendums. 
A referendum on the introduction of a mixed electoral system with strong majority vote could be the first, the president suggested.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A suspected suicide bombing rocked Istanbul's Taksim Square on Sunday (October 31st), injuring at least 22 people. 
Riot police stationed at the square may have been targeted. 
At least nine of them were wounded, two critically, according to Istanbul Police Chief Huseyin Capkin. 
No group has claimed responsibility yet for the blast, though Sunday marks the end of a unilateral ceasefire that had been declared by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

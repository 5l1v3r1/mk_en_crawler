SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Commander General David Leakey said Tuesday (24 May) that while the police sector in BiH might be competent to tackle local crime, it needs an upgrade to fight organised crime on the national level.
In offering to assist authorities, Leakey stressed that EUFOR is neither a police force nor a tax collection agency, and that the relevant BiH institutions must conduct such tasks.
He described organised crime as one of the country's gravest problems.
In other news, Republika Srpska police chief Dragomir Andan has apologised for a recent comment suggesting there were links between foreign Islamic fighters during the BiH war and the March 2004 terrorist bombings in Madrid.
In an interview published in Wednesday's edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine, Andan apologised for any anxiety he had caused and said his statement had been taken out of context.

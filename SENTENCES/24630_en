BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic says Serbia plans to submit its request to become an official EU candidate in April, a year after signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
In media interviews Tuesday (January 6th), he also acknowledged that liberalising the visa regime with the EU and including Serbia on the so-called white Schengen list would probably happen in 2010, not this year as initially hoped. 
Cvetkovic added he does not expect early elections in 2009. 
He said he hopes the government has overcome differences, as unity and stability of the ruling coalition are key to helping Serbia survive the global economic crisis.

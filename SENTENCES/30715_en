BELGRADE, Serbia -- The trial of 14 suspects charged in the brutal beating death of French soccer fan Brice Taton entered its final phase Tuesday (January 11th) with the prosecution presenting its closing arguments.
They say they proved the charges and insisted the defendants receive adequate punishment.
The victim's mother, Suzanne Taton, also appeared in court and asked the judges to deliver justice for her son.
Defence attorneys offer their final arguments Wednesday.
The trial began in April.
Taton, 28, was beaten by fans of the Belgrade team Partizan while sitting at a downtown Belgrade cafÃ© with other Toulouse fans in September 2009.
He died about two weeks later.

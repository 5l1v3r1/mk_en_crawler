TIRANA, Albania -- The EU wants Albania to resolve its political stalemate by May 10th, for the good of the country's integration processes.
The ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party have been at odds for months over the June 2009 general elections.
The EU needs facts not promises, Spain's Ambassador to Tirana -- Manuel Montobio -- said on Tuesday (April 27th), prior to sending his quarterly report on the country.
Spain holds the rotating EU presidency.
May 10th is the date of the meeting between EU and Albanian officials, on the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

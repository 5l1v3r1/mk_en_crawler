TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha assembled army chiefs and defence ministry officials Tuesday (January 25th) to discuss measures before another protest the opposition plans for Friday. 
Berisha says the protests are coup attempts and that the military will not tolerate any attempts by civilians to approach military facilities. 
The violent January 21st protest was intended to overthrow institutions, Berisha said, citing information from foreign intelligence agencies. 
But General prosecutor Ina Rama refutes that claim, saying police reports indicate only damage to state property.
Rama is asking the United States for help in investigating the protest during which three people died and dozens were injured. 
She says the assistance would be technical, particularly lab expertise, to validate the process. 
US Ambassador Alexander Arvizu urged the main political parties to reconsider plans for rallies later this week.
Meanwhile, the organisation Human Rights Watch is calling for independent investigations into last week's violence and urged Berisha not interfere with the prosecution's work. 
Six officials with the National Guard have refused to report to prosecutors about the violence. 
Berisha backs them, saying the Guard prevented a coup. 
Human Rights Watch also urged the opposition to refrain from provocative statements.

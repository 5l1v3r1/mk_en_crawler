BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A two-seater aircraft crashed in flames after being accidentally shot down by a wedding party in central Serbia on Sunday (12 October). 
It is common practice in Serbia for partygoers to fire into the air. 
According to eyewitness reports, the plane was hit in the left wing. 
As it tried to land, it struck power lines and burst into flames, seriously injuring those on board. 
Officials say neither had a pilot's license.

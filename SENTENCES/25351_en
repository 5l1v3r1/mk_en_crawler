TIRANA, Albania -- EUROPOL says criminal groups led by Albanians challenge European organisations via drug trafficking. 
In its annual report published on Monday (October 26th), the European police noted that Albania is believed to play a central role in drug trafficking and maintains strong connections with Kosovo and Italy in human trafficking, heroin and marijuana smuggling.
In other news, the US State Department issued its annual International Religious Freedom report Monday, noting that Albania respects religious freedom, as provided in its constitution. 
The report added that the use of religious symbols is allowed in public institutions and the government respects these freedoms. 
According to the report, there are no indications of social discrimination based on religious grounds in Albania.

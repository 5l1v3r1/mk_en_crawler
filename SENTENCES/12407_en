THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided on Thursday (9 June) to grant provisional release pending trial to former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff General Momcilo Perisic.
He has been indicted on more than a dozen counts of war crimes in connection with the siege of Sarajevo and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
The court said it was satisfied that Perisic would return to The Hague for the start of his trial.
He surrendered earlier this year and pleaded not guilty in March.
Also Thursday, former Bosnian Serb paramilitary leader Milan Lukic's lawyer said his client plans to surrender to The Hague tribunal soon.
He is charged in connection with massacres in the eastern Bosnian town of Visegrad.

NEMEA, Greece -- Hundreds of people from 36 countries put on tunics and raced barefoot in two events described by organisers as the "real" Olympics. 
Participants between the ages of 10 and 93 competed in a 100m and 7.5km race in a stadium built in 330 BC. 
Winners received the same prizes as their predecessors more than 2,000 years ago -- a ribbon tied around the head, a palm branch, and a crown of wild celery.
In other news, Greek weather forecasters are predicting thunderstorms and cooler temperatures for the second half of August, during the Athens Olympics. 
The storms are expected to last between 30 minutes and one hour and occur in the early afternoon. 
They will not pose a problem for the Olympics, because most events are scheduled for morning and evening.

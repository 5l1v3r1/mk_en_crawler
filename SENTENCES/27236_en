BELGRADE, Serbia -- Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said in an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti on Wednesday (February 3rd) that Serbia has achieved significant progress in its EU integration process and could progress "relatively fast" towards meeting its goal. 
Moratinos, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, voiced expectations that member states could unblock ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement by June. 
He stressed that recognition of Kosovo's independence is not a precondition for Serbia's EU accession.

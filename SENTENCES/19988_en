BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU announced on Tuesday (December 18th) that it has decided not to cut farm aid to Romania by 25% in 2008.
The European Commission had given the country until the mid-December to improve its accounting of the EU farming subsidies.
The main problem had been related to software used to track spending and to avoid fraud.
Independent auditors from Deloitte confirm that the Romanian government has resolved all issues.

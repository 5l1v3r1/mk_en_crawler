ATHENS, Greece -- Greece is paralysed on Thursday (May 20th) by a 24-hour strike in the public and private sector, organised by the two leading labour unions in the country and supported by a third. 
The catalyst this time is reforms to the pension system that would cut payments by 15% and boost the retirement age. 
The strike has halted public transportation, including railways and flights.
On Wednesday, the government fully repaid a 10-year 8.5 billion-euro bond that was maturing, using part of the first tranche it received of the 110 billion-euro EU/IMF bailout. 
The country's inability to repay the bond prompted the emergency loan.

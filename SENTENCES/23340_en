ATHENS, Greece -- Gunmen fired at a train travelling in a suburb of Athens, shattering windows in a middle car, local media reported on Friday (December 26th).
It happened near the suburb of Tavros on Thursday night.
No one aboard suffered injury.
That was the third incident involving firearms since a police officer shot a 15-year-old boy dead on December 6th, which triggered violent protests and rioting across the country.
Meanwhile, a fresh wave of arson damaged seven cars, a bank and a government building in Athens early Thursday following three weeks of protests against the teenager's killing.
Officials reported no injuries.
On Wednesday evening, about 700 protesters marched through Athens' main shopping district to demand the release of those arrested during the recent rioting.

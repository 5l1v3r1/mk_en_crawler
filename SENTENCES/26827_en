NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police announced on Tuesday (March 9th) that they have arrested two persons in connection with the theft of late President Tassos Papadopoulos's remains, along with a third suspect who was already in jail for other crimes. 
The corpse, stolen in December, was found on Monday near a cemetery in Nicosia. 
Police say the motive was ransom, which the family refused to pay. 
The three suspects are described as an Indian with a forged Bulgarian passport, a prison inmate Andonis Propokiou Kitas -- who is serving a life sentence in Nicosia's central prison for serial murder -- and a Kitas relative. 
Investigators believe that Kitas orchestrated the crime from his cell.

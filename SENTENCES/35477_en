ANKARA, Turkey -- Seven Turkish hostages were released in Iraq on Saturday (12 June) and were heading home.
The group that kidnapped them said it had decided not to carry out its threat to execute them.
One Turkish truck driver remains missing.
The released hostages were working for a Turkish construction company in Iraq.
In other news, Turkish authorities arrested 13 people suspected of belonging to Islamic terrorist organisations.
Some of them are thought to have attended training camps in other countries.
The clampdown came as authorities stepped up security for the NATO summit in Istanbul, which will be held from 28 June to 29 June.

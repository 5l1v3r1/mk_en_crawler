SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The 20-day campaign ahead of the 13 March local elections formally began Monday (21 February) with rallies in Skopje, Ohrid and Tetovo.
A total of 379 candidates will run for 85 mayoral positions across the country.
The tightest race is expected to be in Skopje, where incumbent Risto Penov faces four challengers.
Also Monday, the Macedonian government decided to deploy 12 more military staff in Iraq as part of the international coalition's project to train new Iraqi forces.
That brings Macedonia's commitment to 50 personnel.

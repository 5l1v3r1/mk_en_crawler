PRISTINA, Kosovo -- An EULEX panel of judges at the District Court in Pristina has found Kacanik Mayor Xhabir Zharku guilty of extortion and illegal arms possession. 
The trial ended on Thursday (April 21st) with Zharku sentenced to three years in prison and fined 1,500 euros. 
The same sentence was issued to Arsim Kolshi, an assistant to Zharku, while co-defendants Besnik Hasani and Nusret Cena were sentenced to 14 months in prison each. 
They are all accused of pressuring a group of businessmen to drop out of a privatisation process that Zharku and his group wanted for themselves. 
Zharku insists the trial was politically motivated, and his lawyers vow to appeal the ruling. 
He can remain in office until the verdict is final.

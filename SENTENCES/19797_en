BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu accused the European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (November 20th) of blocking Romania's anti-corruption efforts.
In statements quoted by Reuters, Chiuariu accused the EU's executive arm of supporting "the fragmented and cumbersome prosecutor's offices".
He attacked the performance of the National Anti-Corruption Department and said that the three separate national prosecutors' offices dealing with high-level corruption should be combined.
That however, would be impossible, given the EC's recommendations not to amend the current judicial and institutional framework.
Later in the day, Chiuariu said that Reuters had misinterpreted his comments.
In other news, President Traian Basescu on Tuesday sent back to parliament amendments to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedures Code.
According to Basescu, the changes could block investigations, especially against former and current important figures, thereby undermining the state's authority.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN envoy who mediated 33 months of talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians has formally proposed independence for Kosovo. 
Becoming a sovereign state is "the only option for a politically stable and economically viable Kosovo", he said in his report to the UN Security Council, unveiled on Monday (March 26th). 
At the same time, Ahtisaari made it clear that the province would remain under international supervision until it is able to meet all the conditions set out in his report. 
The plan also provides for a number of constitutional and legislative initiatives, aimed at guaranteeing minority rights.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu issued a statement describing it as an "historic day". 
Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic, however, insisted that "any form of independence for Kosovo is unacceptable".

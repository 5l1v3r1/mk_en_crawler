ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (March 22nd) urged legal action against two Kurdish lawmakers involved in clashes with police in the southeast.
The call came after local media aired footage of Sebahat Tuncel, a member of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), slapping a police official in the face Monday following Nevruz celebrations in the southeast province of Sirnak.
In the Batman province, another BDP lawmaker, Bengi Yildiz, protested police interference by picking up a rock.
BDP's chairman Selahattin Demirtas defended the two lawmakers' actions, explaining they were provoked by police using tear gas and water cannons to disperse Kurdish protestors.

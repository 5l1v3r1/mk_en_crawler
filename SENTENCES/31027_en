BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) will conduct a population census in October despite Bosniak objections, Radmila Cickovic, director of the entity's statistics institute, confirmed on Monday (May 2nd), adding that preparations are under way.
Last June, the RS Parliament adopted a law on the census of population and households for 2011 but it stalled in the Council of Peoples due to Bosniak opposition.
The law took effect in October after the Constitutional Court ruled there was no violation of Bosniaks' national vital interests.
But due to these complications, the census could not be held on April 1st-15th as first envisioned.
In February, parliament adopted amendments to the law allowing the government to decide on the timing of the census.

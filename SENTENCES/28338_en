TIRANA, Albania -- A group of EU experts arrived in Tirana on Tuesday (July 13th) to access the country's progress in meeting criteria required for visa-free travel. 
The delegation is to check whether local authorities are exerting enough effort in the areas of law enforcement, fighting crime and corruption and confiscating criminal assets. 
The findings will be considered in the drafting of the final decision on Albania's and Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) readiness to join the visa-free regime, expected by October. 
Local media reported on Wednesday that European Parliament member and rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon wants the two countries included in the visa-free regime as soon as possible.

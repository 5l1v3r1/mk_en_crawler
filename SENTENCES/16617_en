STRASBOURG, France -- The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's arm for legal matters, has welcomed UNMIK's launch of a Human Rights Advisory Panel in Kosovo. 
In a press statement on Friday (7 April), the Commission said the move was in line with its own recommendations. 
The panel will provide legal opinions to Kosovo citizens who believe their rights have been violated, and who have exhausted domestic remedies. 
Its opinions will not be legally binding, however.
In other news, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen has come under criticism from the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which issued a report Friday saying that UNMIK was neglecting systematic corruption and mismanagement at Pristina's airport. 
The report summed up a two-year probe by the OIOS, in co-operation with the EU. 
Jessen-Petersen has rejected the criticism as "entirely unwarranted", arguing that he did not have a mandate to investigate publicly-owned companies in Kosovo. 
He also said OIOS should not have published the findings.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Finance Minister Mihai Tanasescu said Thursday (29 January) the government would meet all conditions under the World Bank Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan (PSAL II) programme by June. 
Until then, the government expects to receive the second tranche of 170m euros agreed under PSAL II. 
The Bank disbursed the first tranche in the same amount in October 2002. 
Tanasescu said the major criteria for completing the programme include privatisation of the country's largest oil company Petrom, natural gas distributors Distrigaz Nord and Distrigaz Sud, as well as several electricity and thermo-power companies.

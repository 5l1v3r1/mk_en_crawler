BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Bosnian Serb General Radivoje Miletic will surrender to the UN tribunal to face charges in connection with his role in the Srebrenica massacre, the Serbian government reported Friday (25 February).
He is expected to travel to The Hague on Monday.
Miletic has been indicted jointly with another Bosnian Serb general, Milan Gvero, who gave himself up on Thursday.
An advisor to Serbian President Boris Tadic, Jovan Simic, told local television that the joint indictment also includes the ex-commander of the Bosnian Serb military intelligence, General Zdravko Tolimir.
Talks will be held on his surrender, Simic said.

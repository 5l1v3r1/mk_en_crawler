LUXEMBOURG -- During their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday (13 June), the EU foreign ministers called for quick action by Republika Srpska (RS) to resolve the stalemate over key reforms in the police and broadcasting sectors. 
That in turn would enable the opening of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH. 
The statement from the EU council again expressed deep disappointment with a recent decision by the Bosnian Serb parliament that blocked the restructuring of the BiH police system. 
The foreign ministers also emphasised the importance of unconditional and full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In other news Monday, the RS Banking Agency was asked to immediately block all accounts of the RS ruling Serb Democratic Party. 
The internationally appointed interim administrator of Privredna Banka Srpsko Sarajevo, Toby Robinson, says the move is part of a programme aimed at compensating depositors of the bankrupt bank.

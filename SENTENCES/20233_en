PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR said on Wednesday (October 17th) that as it is the only armed force in the province -- the Albanian National Army (ANA) and the army of Tsar Lazar will not be allowed to operate there. 
The statement was in response to one by an ANA representative Tuesday, who said its members will take up control over northern Kosovo unless KFOR, international and local police establish Kosovo institutions in the region by the end of the month. 
A Tsar Lazar army representative has said the organisation has declared a military situation in Kosovo and that armed members plan to gather in Gazimestan on December 9th, the day before ongoing negotiations to determine Kosovo's final status are scheduled to end.
In other news Wednesday, Russia's envoy to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, said it is too early and risky to speak of a breakthrough in those talks between Belgrade and Pristina. 
Chizhov noted that there has been some progress in the talks, so December 10th should not be considered a deadline. 
"We do not see December 10th as some kind of a watershed. 
It is just a completion of a stage," Chizhov said. 
Russia backs Belgrade's demand for maintaining some control over Kosovo, while Pristina demands independence.

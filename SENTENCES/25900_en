SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament accepted the resignation of Central Bank Governor Ivan Iskrov early Thursday (August 20th), but his re-appointment is expected shortly.
The resignation was required because procedure had been violated in giving him another six-year term:
he was elected before his last term had officially ended, in violation of the Central Bank Act.
Less than a week ago, new Prime Minister Boyko Borissov stressed that he appreciates professionals in government, citing Iskrov specifically.
He took over the helm of the Central Bank in October 2003 after serving as a member of several parliamentary budget and EU-related commissions.

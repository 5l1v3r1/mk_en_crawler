SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The chief of the EU Police Mission to Macedonia, General Juergen Paul Scholz, considers the security situation in the country to be stable but does not exclude the possibility of new tensions. 
In a media interview Sunday (13 February), Scholz said he believes the public understands violence cannot resolve political problems. 
As for local elections scheduled for next month, Scholz said there is a risk of armed incidents, due to the number of illegal weapons in the country.

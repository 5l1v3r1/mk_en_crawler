BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission announced Monday (15 November) that it has no plans to expel Greece from the Eurozone, despite revelations that Athens consistently reported deflated budget deficit figures. 
According to EU Economics Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, the Greek deficit was above the EU mandatory ceiling of 3 per cent between 1997 and 2003. 
The EU's decision to allow Greece to adopt the euro was largely based on the figures for 1999. 
Athens' official number for that year was 1.8 per cent of GDP, whereas the actual figure, according to Greek media reports, was 3.38 per cent.

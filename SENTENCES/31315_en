SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A census of Bulgaria's population began on Tuesday (February 1st), the first in a decade. 
The count will be available online at the Bulgarian Statistical Institute's website until February 9th, making the country one of only seven EU member states to offer the option. 
From February 10th to February 28th, over 50,000 census takers will visit households, homes and buildings to conduct the count. 
Anyone who refuses to provide census information faces a 60 euro fine. 
In the 2001 census, the population was 7,932,984 people. 
Experts expect a drop in that figure due to aging and large-scale immigration.

ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament began debating the cabinet's economic performance Friday (10 June), with a confidence vote scheduled on Sunday. 
The move began with a motion from the opposition PASOK party, which called for a vote of no confidence against Economy and Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis, given the budget deficit. 
But Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis went a step further, tabling a request of his own Wednesday for a confidence vote covering his whole cabinet.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Partitioning Kosovo would be a tragedy for everyone, the co-ordinator of the government's strategy for the north, Ylber Hysa, said Saturday (April 3rd). 
Calling for wide-ranging discussions on the future, he said integration of the north will take time and will not be easy. 
"If you hold a referendum with the question of whether Kosovo should be divided or not and ask all Serbs living in Kosovo, not only the ones in the north, I do not believe that they would be in favour of it," he said.

TIRANA, Albania -- Defence ministers from Southeast Europe gathered in Tirana on Wednesday (27 September) for their annual meeting.
Issues related to boosting military co-operation and security in the region, as well as participation in international peacekeeping missions, topped the agenda.
Participants also decided to grant observer status to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro and Serbia.
A closed-door discussion of the Kosovo status problem was held as part of the event but no comments were made afterwards.
US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, currently on a tour of the region, attended the sessions.
He reaffirmed his country's support for further NATO expansion, but said no one could currently say when Adriatic Charter members Albania, Croatia and Macedonia would be invited to join the Alliance.
The decision must be taken by the NATO states, he added.

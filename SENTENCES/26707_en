PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- The Party of European Socialists (PES) urged the Albanian government Monday (December 7th) to investigate the June 28th elections in the country, as the opposition Socialist Party (SP) has demanded for months. 
After a meeting in Prague, the PES stressed that the government must find a solution to the political crisis caused by the SP's boycott of parliament over the elections. 
Ilir Meta, leader of Albania's Socialist Movement for Integration, the junior partner in the government, attended the meeting in Prague and said the SP's demands are not supported by facts. 
SP leader Edi Rama left the hall during Meta's speech.

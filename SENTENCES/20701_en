NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Special Envoy to Cyprus Michael Moller rejected on Thursday (February 7th) the possibility of the UN launching a new initiative to reunify the divided island. 
Speaking at a parade for the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus, Moller said the UN believes the "key to a settlement" lies not with it, but with the Cypriots themselves. 
"This year may indeed prove crucial for a solution, but we have seen expectations raised many times before," he noted. 
"The time has come for serious negotiations. 
The window of opportunity we have this year will not remain open forever."
Separately, in an interview in Friday's Zaman newspaper, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu rejected the possibility of Kosovo becoming a precedent for Cyprus. 
Sejdiu, who met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday, stressed that Kosovo is a unique case and could not lead to a similar separation on the part of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

ATHENS, Greece -- Public transport in Athens will grind to a halt again due to a fresh 24-hour strike Wednesday (December 22nd), as sector employees protest the government's austerity measures.
Parliament is expected to wrap up a debate Wednesday on next year's budget and vote on it by midnight.
In addition to the work stoppage, a rally is planned in Sintagma Square, in downtown Athens.
At the same time, organisers have agreed to ease planned actions for Thursday and Friday, after shop owners in Athens asked them to consider people doing their Christmas shopping.

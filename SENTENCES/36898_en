SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH is behind schedule in adopting key legislation set as a pre-condition for launching negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, according to the European Commission's spokesman in BiH, Frane Maroevic. 
Tuesday's (6 July) edition of the daily Nezavisne novine quoted him as saying that although the country has made some progress, most bills await review by the BiH Parliament. 
He urged BiH authorities to intensify efforts.
In other news, the BiH Central Bank officially opened its new facility in Sarajevo on Monday, along with the newly launched single register of bank accounts in BiH.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias said on Wednesday (March 19th) he is ready for a solution acceptable to Turkish Cypriots in the long-standing dispute on the divided island.
"We want a working solution as soon as possible," Christofias, a Greek Cypriot, told journalists ahead of his meeting Friday with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.
"This time we must succeed.
Another failure would be devastating for the future of our peoples, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots," he added.

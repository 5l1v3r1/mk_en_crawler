ZAGREB, Croatia -- NGO Croatian Cultural Movement (HUP) plans to nominate former General Ante Gotovina as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections in the country. 
Gotovina, along with fellow-generals Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, is charged by The Hague war crimes tribunal for crimes against Serbs committed during Operation Storm in August 1995. 
The organisation announced on Saturday (September 12th) that it will hold a convention on September 19th where Gotovina's nomination will be officially announced. 
According to different estimates, Operation Storm killed between 1,000 and 5,000 people.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb policeman Dragan Zelenovic will plead guilty to war crimes charges before the UN tribunal under a plea bargain reached with prosecutors, according to tribunal judge Alphons Orie on Tuesday (January 16th).
In July, Zelenovic pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of rape and torture of Bosniak women in Foca in the spring of 1992.
Under the plea bargain, he would plead guilty to half the charges, with the other seven dropped.
The deal would require the judges' approval.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Hundreds of thousands of state employees are on strike Monday (May 31st) against government austerity measures that would result in painful salary cuts.
According to labour union leaders, an estimated 700,000 medical staff, teachers and other public servants are participating.
Staff in schools and public institutions will strike indefinitely, while employees in the healthcare sector, transportation and the prison system are joining for one day as a sign of solidarity.
Despite the protests, the government is determined to implement the measures, which would cut wages in the public sector by 25% and pensions by 15%, effective Tuesday.

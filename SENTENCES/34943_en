SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH government failed to meet the Monday (15 December) deadline set by the Office of the High Representative for submitting the draft law on intelligence to the BiH Parliament. 
The government's committee for internal affairs reportedly could not reach agreement and postponed discussion until Friday. 
Banja Luka daily <I>Nezavisne novine</I> quoted BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic as saying that the law was blocked by the completely opposite stances on the draft taken by the two entities. 
He implied that High Representative Paddy Ashdown might have to intervene.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Representatives of several NGOs staged a protest Sunday (October 11th) outside the Serbian government building demanding July 11th be proclaimed a day of remembrance marking the Srebrenica genocide.
About 8,000 unarmed Bosniak men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb forces on that date in 1995.
The protesters included groups from Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel and the Palestinian territories.
On January 15th of this year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution proclaiming July 11th a day of remembrance for Srebrenica victims.

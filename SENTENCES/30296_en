ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey is bringing its citizens back from Libya amid deadly riots against the government of Muammar Gaddafi over the past several days.
The government announced on Sunday (February 20th) that 256 Turkish nationals have returned to the country on regular and special flights.
Another 281 planned to depart from Bengazi on Sunday.
A crisis unit has been set up in Ankara to deal with the issue.
Some of those arriving in Istanbul said they had been roughed up by Libyans.
Others said protestors have torched the offices of Turkish firms.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki says Macedonia has proposed different initiatives to Greece aimed at improving bilateral relations that have been strained for the past 18 years over the countries' bitter name dispute. 
On Wednesday (March 18th), Milososki announced that, in a letter sent to Greek counterpart Dora Bakoyannis, he has suggested ways for the two countries to overcome the issue. 
He proposed signing a joint declaration of friendship and co-operation, as well as a framework proposal for progress in bilateral relations. 
The initiative comes just days ahead of Macedonia's presidential and local elections on Sunday, which the European Commission is watching closely.

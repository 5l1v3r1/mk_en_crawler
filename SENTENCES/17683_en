NEW YORK, United States -- Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, Economy Minister Ali Babacan, said on Saturday (March 24th) that his government plans to complete all reforms required for EU accession before the general elections in 2012. 
Turkey will set its own reform agenda, the minister insisted at an investment conference in New York. 
The government will announce a detailed programme in April, which will include a comprehensive schedule for reforms that will be undertaken over the next five years. 
The EU froze talks on several chapters in the acquis late last year, after Turkey refused to open its ports and airports to Cypriot carriers as promised.

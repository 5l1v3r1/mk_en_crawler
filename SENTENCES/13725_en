ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Thursday (19 January) that Croatia will pay its WWII debts to Italy as required by the Osimo and Rome accords, but ruled out any review of the agreements.
Earlier this week, Italian WWII refugees staged a protest in Strasbourg, demanding speedy repayment.
Sanader said he believes the rally was related to Italy's upcoming elections.
He insisted that Croatia is ready to settle the 28m-euro debt, noting that the government has urged parliament to give its approval.

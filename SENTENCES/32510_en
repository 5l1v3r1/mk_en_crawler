BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Committee on NATO Integration convened Tuesday (11 March) in Bucharest to determine the final version of the NATO accession calendar. 
The document would accompany the country's letter of intent for joining the alliance and would include deadlines for completing a set of reforms before full membership. 
The country expects to sign accession protocols on 26 March along with the other six candidates.

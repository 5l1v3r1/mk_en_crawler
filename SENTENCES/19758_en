BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Friday (January 18th) that it would launch negotiations with Belgrade later this month that -- if a number of criteria are met -- could lead to the lifting of the current visa regime for Serbian nationals.
Similar negotiations will take place with other countries of the Western Balkans.
In September, the EU eased the visa requirements for some categories of travelers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro.
On Sunday, Montenegrin Interior Minister Jusuf Kalamperovic predicted his will be the first country to have its visa regime with the EU fully scrapped.
The EC meanwhile reminded Serbia that it must co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal if it wants to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
New UN chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz discussed the topic on Friday with EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.

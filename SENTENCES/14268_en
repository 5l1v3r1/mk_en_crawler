BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has again called on Belgrade to step up co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and hand over fugitive Ratko Mladic.
During a news conference in Brussels Monday (13 February), Rehn said UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte told him Serbia's level of co-operation has worsened over the past several months.
Meeting Hague-related obligations are key to completing negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, he added.
Also Monday, donors officially launched the second phase of an internationally sponsored programme for the development of southern Serbia.
Over the next two years, more than 10m euros would be invested in the area, which is populated mainly by ethnic Albanians.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) will encourage member states to open their labour markets to Romanian and Bulgarian workers as soon as possible in a report due for release Tuesday (November 18th).
Media reports say the document reiterates "freedom of movement is a right for every EU worker and is one of the EU's four fundamental freedoms".
The report also points out the two EU enlargements -- in 2004 and 2007 -- did not lead to a massive influx of workers from the new member states to the old ones.
Also Monday, media reported the Irish government expects to keep labour market restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian citizens for at least three more years, due to rising unemployment.
Both countries argue the measure is discriminatory and treats them as second-class EU members.

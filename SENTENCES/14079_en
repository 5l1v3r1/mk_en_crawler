VIENNA, Austria -- A second round of negotiations on Kosovo's future status kicked off in Vienna on Friday (17 March). 
The UN-led talks between delegations representing Serbia and Kosovo will address decentralisation-related issues, including the funding of municipalities, as well as their ties to each other and to Serbia. 
The first round of talks, held in February, focused on decentralisation from the perspective of healthcare, social policy, education, the judiciary, and law enforcement. 
Friday's session began on an adversiarial note, with Serbia filing a formal objection to the participation of Kosovo opposition politician Hashim Thaci, whom it accuses of war crimes.

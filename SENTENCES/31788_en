MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Serbs in Mitrovica took to the streets Thursday (3 April), protesting the proposed transfer of powers from UNMIK to Kosovo institutions. 
Milan Ivanovic of the Serb National Council of northern and central Kosovo, which organised the protest, said UNMIK has not moved ahead with decentralisation and local elections in the northern part of the town. 
Protestors say transferring powers will lead to Kosovo's independence.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court decided on Tuesday (June 17th) that the first session in the trial of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will occur on July 1st. 
The AKP faces banning if the court rules that the party threatens the secular character of the state. 
Dozens of politicians, including President Abdullah Gul, could be banned from politics for a period of five years. 
Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, prosecutor for the Supreme Court of Appeals, will be the first to face the 11 judges of the Constitutional Court in outlining his case against the AKP. 
The party, in turn, will present its oral defence on July 3rd. 
A rapporteur appointed by the Constitutional Court then prepares a nonbinding report on the substance of the case.

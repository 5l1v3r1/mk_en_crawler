SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko on Sunday (August 15th) lifted sanctions against three people who were removed from office for obstructing implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Mladen Tolj, Pero Madjar and Davor Silic had been banned from holding any official, elective or appointive public offices and from running in elections for the past several years.
Measures against Tolj were undertaken in 2001, while Madjar and Silic were sanctioned in 1999 and 2002 respectively.
Tolj was head of the Department of Urban Planning and Housing of the Bratunac Municipality;
Silic was deputy minister of Justice and Administration in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton;
Madjar was mayor of the Kiseljak Municipality.
Inzko said on Sunday the three no longer pose a threat to democracy.

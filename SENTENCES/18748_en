SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal's spokesman in BiH, Matias Hellman, said on Tuesday (February 6th) there is reason to believe that some fugitives might be accessible to the Republika Srpska (RS) authorities.
Speaking at a news conference in Sarajevo, Hellman again accused BiH, particularly RS, of insufficient co-operation with the tribunal.
Six fugitives remain on the loose.
Later Tuesday, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik denied that the entity was failing to co-operate.

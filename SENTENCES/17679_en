SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's ruling tripartite coalition plans to implement the majority of European Commission (EC) recommendations for reforms by the end of the German EU presidency in June.
At a meeting Sunday (March 25th), Bulgarian Socialist Party head Sergei Stanishev, National Movement leader Simeon Saxe-Coburg and Movement for Rights and Freedoms head Ahmed Dogan agreed to the timetable.
In the latest monitoring report on Bulgaria, published at the end of September, the EC presented a set of six benchmarks for judicial reforms.
Failure to meet them would lead to the activation of safeguards.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic scheduled the first parliament session for 22 December, the presidential office announced Friday (12 December).
The new parliament will reflect the 23 November general election results, which gave the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) 66 seats in the 152-member body.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister designate Ivo Sanader announced that the government would have 12 to 14 ministries -- less than the current number.
He said he wants to boost efficiency in the state apparatus.
In related news, the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) almost unanimously agreed to join HDZ in a coalition to form a new government.
The decision was made during a session of the HSLS governing council Saturday.
The council recommended that the party leadership ask for at least 1 strong minister, but said it is open to HDZ's proposals.

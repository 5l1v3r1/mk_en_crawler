BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Environment and Water Management Minister Speranta Ianculescu said Friday (15 October) the country would need 29 billion euros to meet EU environmental standards, as stipulated during its accession talks with the EU. 
She added that implementation of environmental projects would extend beyond the country's projected EU entry in 2007 but the transition period had yet to be decided. 
The largest part of the funds would go for improvement of water quality, Inaculescu said.

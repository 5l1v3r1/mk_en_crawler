ATHENS, Greece -- The UN compliance committee of the Kyoto Protocol has decided to reinstate Greece in the protocol's carbon dioxide emission trading regimen after a seven-month suspension, the environment ministry announced on Friday (November 14th). 
The committee excluded Greece from the emission trading mechanisms in April after UN inspectors concluded methods for testing pollution levels were inadequate.
Also Friday, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis announced a 15% cut in military spending for 2009. 
The announcement was made after the euro zone, of which Greece is a member, officially confirmed it has entered its first recession.

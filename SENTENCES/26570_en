SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU envoy to Macedonia Erwan Fouere and US Ambassador to Skopje Philip Reeker on Wednesday (February 10th) strongly rejected as unacceptable a recent remark by the leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA).
Menduh Thaci said that if the government continues to discriminate against Albanians, there will be war in Macedonia.
The opposition DPA has been boycotting parliament since last summer, protesting the government's policy towards Albanians.
Both Reeker and Fouere urged Thaci to drop the rhetoric and return to parliament.

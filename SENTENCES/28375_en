SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said on Tuesday (November 16th) that former Bulgarian chief prosecutor Nikola Filchev may be linked to two murders committed in 2000 and 2002.
Tsvetanov said that an investigation is under way into the killings of prosecutor Nikolai Kolev and lawyer Nadezhda Georgiev.
The latter was killed in her Sofia home in February 2000.
Witnesses claim she received $150,000 to give to Filchev as a bribe to make him terminate an investigation against a state-owned company.
When she failed to hand it over, however, he allegedly plunged a kitchen cleaver into her head.
Kolev, a high ranking prosecutor who served as deputy chief prosecutor of the country between 1994 and 1997, was shot dead outside his home in December 2002.
He had publically stated his opinion that Filchev suffered from a psychiatric disorder, committed crimes and ordered criminal proceedings based on fabricated charges against people he found inconvenient.
Filchev, a controversial figure for years, has left public service.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Monday (December 15th) appointed Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) leader Emil Boc as Romania's new prime minister, after the previous prime minister-designate, Theodor Stolojan, announced earlier in the day he is giving up his nomination.
The PDL deputy leader said he wanted to let younger politicians take the helm.
He added the leaders of the two parties that signed a landmark coalition agreement Sunday to form the new government, the PDL and the Social Democratic Party (PSD), need to "assume the guarantee of this partnership" by holding the positions of prime minster and Senate chairman.
Basascu nominated Stolojan last week, following parliamentary elections on November 30th.
The smallest group in parliament, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, says it will remain an opposition party, as the PDL and PSD coalition offered it only state secretary positions in the new government.

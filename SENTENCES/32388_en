ANKARA, Turkey -- Army Chief of Staff Gen Hilmi Ozkok says his government would consult the United States before deploying troops in northern Iraq. 
Also Wednesday (26 March), he vowed that there would be no such deployment unless a refugee crisis or other situation threatened the security of his country. 
"We have no intention to create a buffer zone, we have no secret aim or goal... 
We have no enmity against anyone," Ozkok said in a bid to reassure Kurds across the border. 
A Kurdistan Democratic Party spokesman in northern Iraq said the statement by the Turkish military would "stabilise the situation". 
On Tuesday, the EU had warned there would be serious consequences for relations between Turkey and the Union should Turkish military forces enter northern Iraq.

LONDON, Britain -- FIFA, the world football governing body, ordered Albania Wednesday (9 March) to pay a fine of 40,000 Swiss franks and play its next two home World Cup qualifiers behind closed doors.
The move came in response to ugly scenes during a game against Ukraine in Tirana on 9 February.
Fans threw objects at players and rushed the field at the end of the match.
Ukraine won the game 2-0, dashing Albania's chances of making it to the finals.

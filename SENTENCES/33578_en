BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops said Wednesday (17 September) they have discovered four large caches of weapons and ammunition left behind in the Serb-run part of the country during the 1992-1995 war. 
The caches, uncovered 20km northwest of Prijedor, contained mortar rockets, explosives, small calibre ammunition, and anti-tank mines, according to an SFOR statement. 
Two of the weapons stockpiles were hidden in caves, it said. 
Over the past six months, SFOR has discovered over 40 tonnes of illegal weapons in northwestern BiH.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted on Thursday (29 September) to pass two key reform bills vital to continued IMF funding. 
The deputies approved an overhaul of the country's pension system as well as plans for the restructuring and privatisation of Serbia's biggest oil firm. 
The IMF had set both laws as a condition for providing economic assistance and backing Serbia-Montenegro in its agreements with foreign creditors.
The deputies also adopted Serbia's new penal code, which aims to meet international standards. 
Some 30 new crimes were introduced, including chain of command responsibility for war crimes, genocide, terrorism and corruption. 
Money laundering, credit card fraud, computer crimes, and crimes stemming from authorship rights are also included in the new code.

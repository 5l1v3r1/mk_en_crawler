ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Representatives of several Roma organisations in Turkey rallied outside the French consulate in Istanbul on Thursday (August 26th) over France's repatriation of Roma to Romania and Bulgaria. 
"We gathered to protest the wind of racism blowing from Europe, particularly from France against the Roma," the organisations said in a statement. 
They urged the European Commission to move to stop the spread of racism. 
The Roma community in Istanbul has about 2 million members.
Meanwhile, France continued the repatriation Thursday, sending nearly 300 Roma to Bucharest aboard two flights.

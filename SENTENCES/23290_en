BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutor General Laura Codruta Kovesi asked President Traian Basescu on Monday (June 29th) to authorise a criminal investigation into former Privatisation Minister Ovidiu Musetescu, media reported.
Musetescu is suspected of abusing his position in connection with the 2001 privatisation of aluminium companies Alro Slatina and Alprom SA.
Prosecutors said he deliberately low-balled the value of state-owned stakes in the two companies and that the process lacked transparency.

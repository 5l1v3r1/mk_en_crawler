WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. 
Bush authorised weapons supplies to Kosovo on Wednesday (March 19th), indicating the establishment of inter-governmental relations, following recognition of the former Serbian province's independence. 
According to a presidential directive, Kosovo is now eligible to receive US defence equipment and services, which Washington says will "strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace". 
The weapons will be supplied under the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Monday (12 April) urged voters not to support an ultranationalist candidate in the upcoming presidential election. 
He told Tanjug that the international community would react negatively to the election of Tomislav Nikolic of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party. 
So far Nikolic and the Democratic Party's Boris Tadic are the only announced candidates. 
Kostunica would not say whether his Democratic Party of Serbia and its allies, the G17 Plus and the Serbian Renewal Movement, would field their own candidate. 
But G17 Plus deputy head Mladjan Dinkic says the coalition parties will meet Wednesday to discuss the possibility.
Meanwhile, the Serbian-Montenegrin Council of Ministers meets Friday in an effort to find common ground on the government reshuffle. 
At issue is whether Montenegro would agree to give the posts of defence and foreign affairs ministries to Serbia, as was the arrangement under the previous Serbian government.

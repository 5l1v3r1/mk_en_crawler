ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government announced Friday (2 July) that it has signed a 40m-euro loan agreement with the World Bank.
The funds will be used to finance the first phase of a project to fight coastal water pollution.
The total cost of the project is 750m euros, with additional funds to be secured from other donors.
In other news, HINA reported on Saturday that a new survey finds Croatians and Slovenians differ widely in their views on common issues.
According to the survey, Slovenians want to help Croatians in their EU integration bid, while Croatians do not believe they have Slovenian support, or are unaware of it.
Pollsters say the findings underscore the need for better bilateral communication.

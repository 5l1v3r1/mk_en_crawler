BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Talks in Washington between Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Haris Silajdzic, the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, failed to result in any breakthroughs Wednesday (May 23rd). 
The aim was to make some headway in the stalled reform effort. 
According to Silajdzic, the US mediators propose revoking entity voting and the formation of state-level police, but Dodik rejected both ideas. 
Speaking to the media, Dodik stressed that he can accept neither police reform, nor electoral reform without clearly knowing the RS position in the structures. 
He also commented that the proposals' final goal would be the abolition of the entity, to which Bosnian Serbs would never consent. 
The EU has made police sector restructuring a main requirement for sealing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH.

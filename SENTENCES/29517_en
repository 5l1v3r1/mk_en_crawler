BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Saturday (July 31st) that he is offended by the explanation given by a British court for its decision not to extradite former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency member Ejup Ganic.
The court in London said on July 27th that Ganic could not be extradited because there is a risk of a politically motivated trial against him in Belgrade.
"The comment of the judge in the case that it is possible for anyone in Serbia to be tried for political reasons is non-understandable to me and represents a personal offence," Tadic said.
Ganic was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport on March 1st, based on a warrant issued by Belgrade.
Serbia wants him in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, in which more than 40 soldiers were killed.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- A panel of judges at The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) on Thursday (May 5th) rejected a request by Franko Simatovic, a former commander of the special unit of Serbia's State Security Service, to be acquitted of all charges and released.
The judges say there is sufficient evidence pertaining to all counts of the indictment.
Simatovic and former Serb security chief Jovica Stanisic are charged with training, arming and directing paramilitary units that persecuted and killed non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Balkan conflicts.
Their trial began in 2007.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Almost immediately after being selected to represent Bulgaria at the European Commission (EC), Bulgarian European Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva was asked to assume the Commission's new consumer protection portfolio.
She met in Brussels on Thursday (October 26th) with EC President Jose Manuel Barroso and other officials.
The European Parliament appears likely to approve Kuneva without any difficulty late next month.
Meanwhile, Romania's nominee for European commissioner, Varujan Vosganian, ran into problems Thursday.
The EC requested additional vetting amid reports Vosganian may have been an agent of the communist-era Securitate.
The same day, the lower house of the German parliament voted to ratify the accession treaties of Bulgaria and Romania.
But the ruling conservatives and their allies called on the EU to adopt safeguards, in case the two countries fail to reform their judiciaries or to adopt measures related to EU farming assistance.

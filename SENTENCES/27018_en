SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)/LONDON, United Kingdom -- About 2,500 people gathered on Friday (March 5th) in front of the embassies of Serbia and Great Britain -- both in the UK and Sarajevo -- to denounce the arrest of former BiH presidency member Ejup Ganic. 
Ganic was detained March 1st at London's Heathrow Airport on a war crimes warrant issued by Belgrade. 
The demonstrations were organised by war veterans associations in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
The veterans accuse Serbia of continuing its aggression against BiH and called on British authorities to release Ganic. 
A London court has refused to release him on bail. 
The next hearing has been set for March 11th pending introduction of evidence against Ganic from Belgrade.

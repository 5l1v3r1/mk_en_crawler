SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The New Croat Initiative and the Croat Peasant Party will form a coalition during the October local elections in BiH.
The presidents of the two parties, Kresimir Zubak and Marko Tadic, signed the first document on association Friday (28 May).
The parties plan to establish a single co-ordination body and then sign local coalition agreements.
The long-expected unification of the two parties is meant to offer voters an alternative to the most popular Croatian party, HDZ.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu said Tuesday (15 March) that it will be at least a year before any US military bases can operate in Romania.
During a news conference, Atanasiu said the most likely locations for such bases were Dobrogea and Fetesti.
The financial terms of the agreement with Washington could be ready this summer.

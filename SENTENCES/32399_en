BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- President Svetozar Marovic said Monday (24 March) the country would be admitted to the Council of Europe (CoE) on 3 April. 
The date was in line with remarks by senior CoE officials, who had tried to expedite the process following the assassination earlier this month of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Marovic plans to attend the ceremony in Strasbourg.
In other news, Serbian police say 395 people have been charged in connection with Djindjic's murder; 265 of them are described as members of various organised crime groups.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Despite growing differences between two main ruling coalition partners -- the Democratic Party (DS) and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) -- the government will remain in power until the end of its mandate, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic of the DS told the Vecernje Novosti newspaper on Monday (September 17th).
He said that the need to face historic challenges -- keeping Kosovo within Serbia and pursing EU integration -- will help the government overcome internal conflicts.
DSS spokesman Branislav Ristivojevic sounded a similar message Monday, assuring reporters there is no government crisis.
The two main coalition partners have differed recently over Serbia's NATO and EU prospects.

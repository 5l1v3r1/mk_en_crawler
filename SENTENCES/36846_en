ATHENS, Greece -- A power blackout hit the capital and parts of southern Greece around noon on Monday (12 July), just a month before the start of the Summer Olympics, but officials said services were gradually being restored.
Olympic venues and hospitals faced no problems, as they have their own generators.
In other news, Otto Rehhagel has decided to stay on as coach of the Greek national football team, which won the Euro 2004 championship in Lisbon earlier this month.
He reportedly turned down a 5m-euro offer to work as a trainer for his native Germany.

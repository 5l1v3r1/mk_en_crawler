BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Human rights violations cost Turkey almost 25m euros in 2010, more than any other member of the Council of Europe (CoE), CoE official Frederik Sundberg told a press conference in Brussels on Thursday (May 5th).
Last year, Turkey paid out 24.5m euros to defendants to comply with rulings by the European Court of Human Rights.
According to Sundberg, most of the cases involved the treatment of suspected Kurdish separatists.

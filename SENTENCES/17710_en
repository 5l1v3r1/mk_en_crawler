PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK asked Bucharest on Friday (March 23rd) to make available 11 Romanian police officers who were pulled out of Kosovo despite an ongoing investigation. 
At issue is the police response to a pro-independence rally that turned violent last month. 
Two demonstrators were killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on February 10th. 
UNMIK had asked the police officers to remain in Pristina until the investigation ends in early April. 
Romania says it pulled all 75 of its police officers out of Kosovo because they had already extended their tour of duty by a month.

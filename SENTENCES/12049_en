ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has asked the Constitutional Court to review the Revenue Administration Law, according to a statement issued Sunday (15 May).
Earlier in the day, Sezer ratified the law, which he vetoed in late April.
By law, since parliament had approved it twice, he could no longer block it.
Sezer asked for the Court's opinion of the legislation because it includes some texts he finds unconstitutional.
Enactment of the law is a prerequisite for concluding the new stand-by arrangement between Turkey and the IMF.

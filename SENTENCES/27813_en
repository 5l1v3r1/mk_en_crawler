SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- European Parliament (EP) rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, believes that BiH has met most criteria for EU visa liberalisation. 
In an interview with the Nezavisne Novine daily published on Saturday (April 24th), she indicated that the European Commission will submit a proposal to scrap visas for BiH in late May or early June. 
She did not mention any concrete date when visa liberalisation would take effect, only that is would likely occur before the October general elections. 
She reiterated it will depend on the EU's political will and Sarajevo's level of readiness.

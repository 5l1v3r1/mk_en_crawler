SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The campaign to elect representatives to the European Parliament (EP) began on Friday (April 20th), though a new opinion poll by the Alpha Research Agency suggests very low turnout.
Less than 30% of voters say they would cast ballots.
Bulgaria is entitled to elect 18 members of the EP.
In other news Thursday, the head of the Parliamentary Commission for Youth and Sports, Svetoslav Spasov, said that Bulgaria is among the countries that top the list of people traffickers.
He explained that last year, police cracked 17 criminal gangs and 11 trafficking networks.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Thousands of people joined a protest march in Pristina on Tuesday (September 4th) following the murder of Kosovo police officer Triumf Riza.
The march began in Dardani, where Riza, 28, was gunned down last week.
It moved on to the city centre, pausing outside the court to protest the justice system and rising crime.
Prime Minister Agim Ceku, along with representatives of various political parties in Kosovo, joined the march.
Ceku assured protesters of the government's determination to fight crime.
In other news, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) picked its leader, former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, to head its list of candidates in the November 17th parliamentary and local elections.
Although Haradinaj is currently being tried by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, AAK says he will return to Kosovo soon and rejoin politics.

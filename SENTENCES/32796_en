SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former senior officials of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) established a new political party - the Social Democratic Union of BiH - in Sarajevo on Sunday (8 December).
Some 100 people attended the constituent session, which resulted in the election of provisional leaders, a party statute and a programme declaration.
A dozen SDP top officials split off from the moderate party in late November, dissatisfied with the re-election of Zlatko Lagumdzija as party leader.
They blamed him for SDP's defeat in the October general elections.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The Croatian delegation and IMF representatives reached a preliminary deal on a new standby arrangement Saturday (12 June). 
Croatian Finance Ministry State Secretary Martina Dalic said the main emphasis of the agreement was on fiscal restriction and the need to bring the public finance deficit and foreign debt to agreed-upon levels. 
The value of the standby arrangement would be around $99m, Dalic said. 
However, Croatia would not draw funds, since the arrangement would be a precautionary one meant to strengthen the country's credibility and position in EU talks.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic criticised Serbian institutions Sunday (28 November), saying they are jeopardising the European future and general survival of the federal union. 
In a press statement, Marovic said he would inform the EU about the actions of certain Serbian ministries -- actions which, he added, demonstrate that politicians are acting contrary to their public promises. 
He specified that one of the major problems is the failure to meet obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal.

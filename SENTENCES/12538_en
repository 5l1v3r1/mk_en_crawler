ZAGREB, Croatia -- The leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, Ivica Racan, expects a breakup of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) following the 15 May local elections. 
In an interview in Monday's Vecernji list, Racan cited the deepening division in HDZ, which he predicts will lead to a split into two new parties -- a pro-European and reform-oriented branch led by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, and a conservative one that could end up as part of the ultranationalist Croatian Party of Rights.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK head Harri Holkeri and Kosovo Co-ordination Centre head Nebojsa Covic failed to agree Thursday (15 January) on the participation of Serbs in the workgroups drafting standards the province must meet to talk about status. 
Covic explained that work has been going on already without Serbian participation. 
He added that when the Serbian side made proposals, UNMIK rejected many of them. 
UNMIK also explored the possibility of starting Belgrade-Pristina talks, an idea Covic dismissed for now.

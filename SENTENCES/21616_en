NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders have agreed to start direct reunification talks on September 3rd, ending four years of deadlock since the Greek Cypriot community rejected a UN plan for reunification. 
The date was agreed on during a meeting Friday (July 25th) between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. 
In a joint statement afterwards, they also announced plans to establish a direct telephone line, to facilitate communication and underscore their growing commitment to achieving a peaceful solution. 
The UN, the EU and the US welcomed the agreement Friday.

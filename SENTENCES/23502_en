THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Monday (April 27th) that it will resume the trial of two former senior Serb security chiefs, a year after one defendant's health forced an interruption of the trial.
The trial of Jovica Stanisic, former Serb security chief, and his deputy, Franko Simatovic, began in April 2007.
They face charges of training, arming and directing paramilitary units that killed and persecuted non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Balkan conflicts.
The legal proceedings halted last May because of Stanisic's poor health, including depression and kidney stones, which specialists feared prevented him from participating effectively in his defence.
Based on recent medical reports, however, the judges have decided he is now healthy enough to resume the trial on May 25th.
In other news Monday, Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic met with US Ambassador to Serbia Cameron Munter.
Vukcevic told journalists afterwards that they discussed a range of issues, including the requested extradition of suspected Nazi war criminal Peter Egner from the United States and the alleged late 1990s trafficking of organs of kidnapped Kosovo Serbs.
Munter said Washington appreciates Vukcevic's efforts and praised Serbia's co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, stressing there has been "huge progress".

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A two-day meeting of leaders of the various political parties, scheduled to begin on Friday (15 September), is in question now, according to local media reports Wednesday. 
Earlier in the day, Democratic Union for Integration leader Ali Ahmeti told the Macedonian language programme of Radio Free Europe that he would not attend the talks. 
He repeated, however, that he was ready to meet with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in the village of Sipkovica, which in 2001 served as the stronghold of ethnic Albanian militants.
In addition, Vlado Buckovski, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), said he will attend the talks only if Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE-led government halts dismissals in public administration. 
SDSM describes the firings as a purge.

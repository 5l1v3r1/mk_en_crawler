ATHENS, Greece -- The international watchdog group Human Rights Watch urged the EU on Monday (October 12th) to press Greece's new socialist government into ending the shabby treatment of illegal immigrants.
In a report, the organisation criticised Athens for detaining immigrants and housing them in poor conditions, blocking their access to asylum-seeking procedures and expelling them illegally to Turkey.
According to Human Rights Watch, ending immigrant-related abuses, protecting their children and reforming the asylum system should be a priority for both new Prime Minister George Papandreou and Brussels.
Last year, Greek authorities arrested 146,000 illegal immigrants, compared to 58,000 in 2002.

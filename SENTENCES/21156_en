DUBLIN, Ireland -- Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern announced on Friday (February 29th) that Ireland recognises Kosovo's independence.
He added that the decision should not be viewed as an act of hostility towards Serbia.
Iceland also said on Friday that its government has decided to recognise Kosovo's independence based on the February 17th proclamation.
That makes a total of 22 countries offering formal recognition so far.
Meanwhile, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon protesting the formation of an International Steering Group for Kosovo.
The group, comprised of 15 countries that have recognised Kosovo's independence, was established on Thursday in Vienna.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish government announced on Friday (March 25th) that a shipment of Turkish-made guns, apparently bound for Yemen, was illegal."The arms shipment was not a consignment based on permission from Turkish authorities," Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal said. 
Turkey has strict arms export control policies, particularly with regard to countries experiencing unrest. 
An investigation is under way.
The shipment was intercepted in Dubai. 
Authorities there said it contained around 16,000 Turkish-made pistols.

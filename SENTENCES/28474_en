PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The OSCE Mission in Kosovo and the NGO Centre for Peace and Tolerance opened a student support centre Thursday (October 14th) in Gracanica for students at the Technical University in northern Mitrovica.
This centre will provide free support to about 250 Serb students at the campus, helping them to access online resources;
organise events and student groups, and will offer career guidance to reap maximum benefits from their education.
"This is not an OSCE or NGO Centre for Peace and Tolerance project, but it is a project dedicated to you.
You are the key force that will push this project forward," Francesco Bigagli, of the OSCE, told students.

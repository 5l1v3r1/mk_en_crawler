BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu has begun considering early general elections, should the second attempt to select a cabinet fail. 
Speaking to local channel TVR1 on Tuesday (November 10th), Basescu said, if needed, he would dissolve parliament after the November 22nd presidential elections because, by law, parliament cannot be dissolved 60 days before a presidential vote. 
In the meantime, Basescu said he would name another prime minister-designate if parliament doesn't back Liviu Negoita's proposed cabinet. 
That's a sure thing, as the opposition is refusing to support any candidate tapped by Basescu.
Meanwhile, outgoing Prime Minister Emil Boc asked parliament Tuesday to modify regulations regarding a cabinet in this position, to allow the government to submit the pension and fiscal responsibility bills, along with the state budget bill. 
Boc stressed that the measures are among the commitments negotiated with the IMF and must be passed by the end of the year.

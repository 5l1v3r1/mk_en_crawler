NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou said on Wednesday (May 28th) that direct negotiations between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish communities on the divided island cannot begin unless there is sufficient progress in discussions between the respective task forces. 
He warned that any new talks would be otherwise destined to fail. 
In March, newly elected Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed to resume talks on reuniting the island. 
They met last week to review progress in the work of the expert groups, but failed to set an official date for starting direct negotiations.

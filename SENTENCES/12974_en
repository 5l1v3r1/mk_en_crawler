WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States is concerned about "serious irregularities" observed in the second round of Macedonia's local elections, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday (31 March). 
Washington called on all leaders of political parties in the affected areas to publicly condemn actions which attempted to undermine democracy.
On Friday, meanwhile, Skopje began hosting a regional foreign investment forum focusing on free trade agreements and economic reforms. 
Representatives from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Turkey are attending, among others.

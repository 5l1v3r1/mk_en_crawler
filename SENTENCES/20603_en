SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Serb man accused of genocide and crimes against humanity has launched another hunger strike and refused to attend his arraignment before the Sarajevo war crimes chamber, court officials said on Thursday (August 9th).
Former army Captain Milorad Trbic was deputy chief of security with the Zvornik Brigade, which participated in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Trbic and other members of the brigade are also accused of executing 20 Muslim men detained in a school gym in Grbavci.
Initially indicted by the UN tribunal, his case was later transferred to BiH.
His first hunger strike, earlier this summer, lasted three weeks and required medical intervention.
In other news, the Mostar Cantonal Court has sentenced three members of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Army's 9th Mechanised Brigade to 13 years in prison for crimes against Croat civilians in the village of Grabovica.
In September 1993, 33 Croats were killed there.

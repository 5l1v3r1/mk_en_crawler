BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police reforms have reached a dead end, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said Friday (1 September).
He said that he believes the situation stems from the political agreement on police reforms not being implemented, and reiterated that decisions in the police reform directorate must be reached though consensus.
EU officials have repeated on several occasions that a lack of progress in the implementation of police reforms could jeopardize the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
On Saturday, local media reported that NATO officials advised BiH authorities to draft an action plan for the apprehension of Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted by the UN war crime tribunal in The Hague.

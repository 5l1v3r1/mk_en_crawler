ANKARA, Turkey -- The Administrative Court on Wednesday (May 25th) suspended part of the restrictions on the sale of alcohol imposed earlier this year. 
The court ruled that a ban on the sale of alcohol at concerts and other events is a violation of the freedom to buy alcoholic drinks, reaffirming the right of people aged over 18 to purchase and consume alcohol. 
The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Ankara Bar Association. 
The court also overturned a ban on selling alcohol in containers of less than 20 centilitres, which was introduced in an effort to limit access to individual-serving alcoholic drinks. 
The restrictions were enforced in January, amid protests by secularists. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the restrictions are aimed at protecting the youth.

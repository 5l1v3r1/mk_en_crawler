SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The defence ministry reported on Wednesday (16 April) that Sofia has received a request from Washington to send a peacekeeping unit to Iraq.
Bulgaria had initially planned to send 150 chemical decontamination experts, but the military operation ended before the troops could be deployed.
The new unit of about 100 servicemen is expected to perform guard duties, similar to those performed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
President Georgi Parvanov backs the deployment, saying Bulgaria has already made a commitment to help the United States.
The government will submit a report to parliament for debate.
In other news, Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov said Wednesday that experts from the NATO Office of Security have arrived to advise personnel on protecting classified information.
A recent NATO report ranked Bulgaria last among NATO candidates in that regard.

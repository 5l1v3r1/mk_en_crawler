BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee says Bulgaria and Romania should seal the EU Accession Treaty together -- on 25 April, as planned.
Meeting on Wednesday (16 March), panel members discussed the so-called safeguard clauses for Bulgaria and Romania.
Most agreed with the EP rapporteur for Romania, Pierre Moscovici, who said separation of the two cases would send a bad signal and could be viewed as a "humiliation by Romanians".
His draft report on Romania had pointed to a number of problems, including corruption.
The rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey van Orden, argued that it would be unfair for Bulgaria to wait another year because of its pairing with Romania.
The panel finally concluded that the two countries should sign the Accession Treaty together, with possible activation of the safeguard clause afterwards.

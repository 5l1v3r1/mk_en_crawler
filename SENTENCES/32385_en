BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission said Wednesday (26 March) that five Balkan states have made progress towards EU membership in the past year and urged them to show even greater political will for reform. 
Commission President Romano Prodi said that the EU's enlargement will only be complete when Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Serbia-Montenegro are admitted. 
His comments accompanied the presentation of a report on implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the five countries. 
The report cited organised crime, poverty and heavy dependence on foreign aid as the key challenges to these states.
Also Wednesday, the European Commission approved the new Accession Partnership Accord with Turkey. 
It envisions a total of 1 billion euros in aid, if reforms under the IMF-backed programme continue.
In other news, Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana said that his country was on track for EU membership despite a recent quarrel with France over policy on Iraq. 
"It would be impossible and extremely unwise to stop this historic process," he said following a ceremony in Brussels Wednesday at which seven candidates signed accession protocols with NATO.

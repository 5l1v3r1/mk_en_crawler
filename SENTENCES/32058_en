BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a special session Thursday (17 October), the Republika Srpska National Assembly passed a law on ministries, establishing the authority of the entity in accordance with elections results. 
The measure decreases the number of cabinet ministries from 20 to 16 - eight Serbs, five Bosniaks and three Croats. 
The law abolishes the position of deputy minister and leaves only the position of assistant minister. 
That change led representatives of the BiH Democratic Action Party, Party for BiH, Social Democratic Party and New Croatian Initiative to veto the draft. 
They argued that assistant ministers would be appointed rather than elected, preventing the equal representation of all nationalities. 
But High Representative Paddy Ashdown dismissed the Bosniak and Croat veto, clearing the way for adoption by the rest of the 47 deputies.

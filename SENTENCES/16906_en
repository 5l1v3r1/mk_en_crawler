TIRANA, Albania -- The upcoming local elections in Albania will be a crucial test of the country's readiness for Euro-Atlantic integration, OSCE Ambassador Pavel Vacek said in a report submitted to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna late last week. 
The document, parts of which were quoted in the domestic press over the weekend, said previous experience has shown that foreign mediation of political deals on election issues seems to produce "short-term results", as the agreements are seen in Albania as imposed from outside. 
Genuine political will among political leaders is needed for long-term solutions, Vacek reportedly wrote.
The next municipal elections in Albania are expected to be held between 20 December and 20 January 2007.

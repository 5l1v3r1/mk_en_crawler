PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Government leaders said on Wednesday (November 12th) their stance is unchanged regarding the six-point plan UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proposed regarding the future role of the UNMIK and EULEX missions in Kosovo.
After conferring with President Fatmir Sejdiu on Wednesday, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said "What the UN can do with Belgrade is something else;
we represent the institutions and the people of Kosovo, and we are responsible for the documents that we stand behind." Thaci added Pristina would never accept an agreement that contradicts independence and would violate the unitary system of customs, police and justice.
Meanwhile, the Vetevendosja (Self-determination) movement hinted on Wednesday it might organise protests if Sejdiu and Thaci accept Ban's six-point plan.
The movement accuses the pair of tolerating Serbian parallel structures in Kosovo.
In other news Wednesday, Kosovo's parliamentary committee on foreign policy accused the European Commission of being inaccurate and biased in its recent progress report regarding potential EU membership.
The EU says 250,000 Serbs have suffered displacement.
But committee chairman Sabri Hamiti says Kosovo institutions "have always given a figure of 130,000 Serbs who have left".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Romania and Bulgaria are working to join the EU's so-called Schengen Zone in March 2011, Romanian President Traian Basescu told a joint press conference he held with Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov in Sofia on Thursday (September 23rd). 
Parvanov confirmed the common goal and described meeting the Schengen requirement as a top priority for both countries. 
The two officials also discussed the so-called Roma issue amid France's recently launched repatriation of members of the minority to their homelands in Bulgaria and Romania. 
"Expulsions of Roma from France should not affect the Schengen process," Basescu said. 
"The Roma have a nomadic lifestyle and their integration should be an issue treated by the entire EU, not just by the countries they originate from," he added.

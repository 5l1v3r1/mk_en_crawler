SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said on Tuesday (19 July) that the transition from the current Office of High Representative (OHR) to a EU-led mission in BiH is possible within 15 months. 
Addressing a session of parliament's House of Representatives in Sarajevo, Ashdown outlined steps he says must be taken to start the process as well as gradually reduce the so-called Bonn Powers, the OHR chief's internationally guaranteed rights to intervene if necessary to implement the Dayton Agreement. 
Ashdown stressed that the transition to a less interventionist international civilian presence in BiH would be possible only after progress in BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration process.
In other news Tuesday, EUFOR Commander General David Leakey met with BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic. 
Reviewing events in the first half of this year, they agreed that the transition from the NATO-led Stabilisation Force to EUFOR has been a success.
Also on Tuesday, European Commission Ambassador to BiH Michael Humphreys delivered a donation worth 500,000 euros to the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA). 
The donation will help purchase equipment that will better connect SIPA to other police and intelligence structures.
Meanwhile, Raffi Gregorian, co-chairman of the BiH Defence Reform Commission, says the country could enter NATO after 2010, if the parliaments soon adopt draft legislation on restructuring the defence sector. 
His comments appear in an interview in Wednesday's edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine.

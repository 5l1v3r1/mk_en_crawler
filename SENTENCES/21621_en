SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Following Tuesday's (April 22nd) cabinet reshuffle that replaced four ministers and added a fifth post, the European Commission (EC) indicated it wants results in the fight against corruption and organised crime.
"The issue with the appointments ...
is a completely internal issue for Bulgarian authorities, but we, of course, take these changes into consideration.
The appointment of a deputy prime minister without portfolio responsible for EU funding proves the awareness and commitment of the government to guarantee the correct assimilation of EU funding," EC spokesman Mark Grey said.
"In general, we hope that these changes will strengthen multilateral reforms aimed to fight high-level corruption and organised crime, as suggested by the EC." He stressed that the next three months would be significant and that the EC expects both progress and co-operation.

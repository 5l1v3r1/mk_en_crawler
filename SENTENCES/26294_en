THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) on Friday (February 12th) rejected an appeal of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to fire his court-appointed lawyer. 
According to the court, the appointment did not violate the legal rights of the defendant. 
The ICTY appointed British lawyer Richard Harvey to represent Karadzic in November. 
Karadzic has been insisting he would conduct his own defence and would only use the help of legal advisors. 
The trial originally started on October 27th but was suspended until March, due to his refusal to attend the sessions.

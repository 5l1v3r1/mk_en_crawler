Fashion week in Istanbul -- one of Europe's "capitals of culture" for 2010 -- featured the debut of fall-winter collections and the latest innovations in haute couture from two dozen Turkish designers.
The four-day event, which ended February 6th, was sponsored in co-operation with Fashion Designers Association and the Istanbul Fashion Academy. 
The event attracted 35,000 visitors, including US actress Meg Ryan.
In December, there was similar interest at the two biggest Croatian fashion shows -- Dove Fashion.hr and Cro-a-Porter, which opened the autumn season.

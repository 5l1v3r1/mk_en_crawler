ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Erhard Busek, said in a media interview that Croatia might not be ready to join the EU in 2009. 
However, he added, its leaders' EU ambitions deserve praise. 
In an interview with Austria's APA news agency late Thursday (17 August), Busek said in the worst-case scenario, Croatia would join the Union in 2014. 
Zagreb has thus far closed negotiations on just one of the 32 chapters of the acquis but hopes to accelerate the pace of accession talks in the months ahead.

ATHENS, Greece -- Vassilis Maginas was formally sworn in as labour minister Monday (April 30th), following the resignation of Savvas Tsitouridis late last week.
He was sacked amid allegations that the ministry, which oversees state pension funds, was involved in an affair in which allegedly overpriced bonds were sold to a state pension fund.

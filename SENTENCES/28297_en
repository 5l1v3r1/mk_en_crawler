ANKARA, Turkey -- Necmettin Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, was elected on Sunday (October 17th) as leader of the small Saadet (Felicity) party.
Saadet won less than 3% of the votes in the 2007 parliamentary elections and a little over 5% in last year's municipal vote.
Erbakan, 83, was prime minister of a coalition government in 1996 before he was forced to resign under pressure from the secular military circles.
His party at the time, the Refah (Welfare), was banned in 1998 and in 2002, Erbakan was sentenced to two years in prison for embezzlement.
His sentence, however, was later reduced to house arrest.

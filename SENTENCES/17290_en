ANKARA, Turkey -- Following President Ahmet Necdet Sezer's veto of constitutional amendments late last week, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) plans to resubmit the same text and put it to a vote in Parliament Monday (May 28th).
The amendments would result in voters directly electing the president, rather than Parliament.
If it passes this time, as expected, the president will either approve the amendments or call a national referendum on them.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argues that the changes are needed in order to modernise the electoral and bring the country closer to the EU.
Sezer says the amendments could threaten the balance of power in Turkey.

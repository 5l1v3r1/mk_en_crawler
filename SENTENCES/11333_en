SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH is on the right path and great progress has been achieved in recent years, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said in an interview published in Tuesday's (26 July) Dnevni avaz.
However, he called for increased efforts towards reform, democratisation and Euro-Atlantic integration.
The NATO chief stressed the importance of defence reforms, praising the recent signing of a political agreement on the new defence reform laws, and urging tighter collaboration between the two entities' armed forces.
He reaffirmed the commitment of NATO HQ in BiH to assist the transformation processes.
In the interview, Scheffer also reiterated the importance of full-co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
When Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are brought to justice, BiH will be very close to joining NATO, he said.

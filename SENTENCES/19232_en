VIENNA, Austria -- A new round of talks on the final status of Kosovo begins in Vienna on Thursday (August 30th) amid widespread pessimism about its outcome. 
A troika of negotiators from the Contact Group for Kosovo is meeting first with Kosovo's delegation, then with Belgrade's. 
Direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina are not expected for another month.
On Wednesday, both sides indicated their positions had not changed. 
"The independence and territorial integrity of Kosovo is non-negotiable," said Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic again insisted that Belgrade would never agree to cede Kosovo.

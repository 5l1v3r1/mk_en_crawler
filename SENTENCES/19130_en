ANKARA, Turkey -- Three Turkish soldiers were killed by a landmine on Saturday (June 30th) during a gunfight between rebels and troops in the Tunceli province near the border with Iraq. 
According to military sources, the device was planted by guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Meanwhile, Masoud Barzani, the head of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, said any Turkish military operation against PKK bases in Iraq could lead to "catastrophe". 
He added that the Kurdish authorities in Iraq were ready for dialogue and compromise with Turkey. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said earlier on Friday that Ankara has already drawn up plans for a military operation against the PKK in Iraq but has still not decided whether to launch it.

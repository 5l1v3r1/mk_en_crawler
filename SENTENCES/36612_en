THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- President of the UN war crimes tribunal Theodor Meron wrote a letter to the UN Security Council on Tuesday (4 May), complaining that Serbia-Montenegro has failed to fulfil its obligations to find and detain war criminals. 
Meron said he supports the international prosecutor's view that co-operation with the court is "nearly nonexistent". 
The complaint to the Council is the most serious action the tribunal can take against Serbia-Montenegro. 
The UN could impose sanctions as a result. 
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic warned that continued failure to meet international obligations would discredit Serbia-Montenegro's reputation and affect progress towards EU and NATO membership.

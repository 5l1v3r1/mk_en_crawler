PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Slovak Foreign Minister Jan Kubis reiterated his country's opposition to the independence of Kosovo during a visit there Tuesday (April 22nd).
"The stance of our country remains unchanged:
Kosovo's final status resolution didn't come through the UN Security Council, to which Slovakia is committed," Kubis said.
But he added that Slovakia will keep contributing to the KFOR and EULEX missions and is open to economic and social partnership with Kosovo.
For his part, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu insisted Slovakia should reconsider its stance and move towards recognition of Kosovo.
Kubis also met with moderate Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic.

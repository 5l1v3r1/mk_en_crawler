SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Energy and Tourism ministry announced Thursday (March 4th) that Bulgaria will join Turkey-Greece-Italy natural gas pipeline, part of the EU's southern energy corridor. 
Minister Traycho Traykov signed a contract in Thessaloniki on Friday creating the joint venture that will build a link to Greece's section of the pipeline. 
The Bulgarian Energy Holding will have a 50% stake in the company, while the remaining stake will be held by IGI Poseidon, owned by the Greek and Italian companies. 
The project is expected to be operational by 2013 and will reduce Bulgaria's dependence on Russian supplies.

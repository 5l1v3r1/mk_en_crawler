ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin will meet with Pope Benedict XVI on behalf of the Turkish government during his visit next week, according to an announcement Wednesday (November 22nd).
Both Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul will be in Riga at the time, attending the NATO summit.
The foreign ministry says the Vatican had been advised of the scheduling conflict, but insisted on the pope arriving on the feast day of Saint Andrew the Apostle, the founder of the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul.
Turkey is mounting one of its largest ever security operations to ensure the safety of the pontiff.
On Wednesday, Istanbul police detained 39 people who participated in a rally protesting the trip.

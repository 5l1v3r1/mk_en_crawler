BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (11 July) that war criminals must face justice, regardless of where they committed their crimes.
Speaking on the 11th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, he called for the punishment of those responsible for Europe's worst post-WWII atrocity.
"That must happen because it could burden future generations," Tadic explained.
Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte issued a statement of her own, complaining that she is not getting the support she needs.
"I'm seeking justice for the victims but nobody is listening to me anymore," the Swiss prosecutor said.
She accused Serbia, particularly Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, of refusing to arrest Ratko Mladic and insisted that no one was looking for Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
She was among the 50,000 people who gathered in Srebrenica on Tuesday to inter the remains of 505 recently identified Muslim victims.
In other news Tuesday, the war crimes court in Sarajevo sentenced a former Bosnian Serb policeman to five years in prison for the rape and disappearance of Muslim civilians.
Boban Simsic, 38, was found guilty of participating in a 1992 campaign of ethnic cleansing and the rape of numerous Muslim women, while serving as a guard at a detention facility in Visegrad.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Cemil Cicek dismissed the possibility of early elections Monday (13 June), amid a spate of media reports suggesting that such a scenario is being considered by both the ruling Justice and Development Party and the main opposition Republican People's Party.
Cicek stressed that the government has no plans to initiate parliamentary elections earlier than the constitutionally set deadline of November 2007.

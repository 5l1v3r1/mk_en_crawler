BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The committee assigned to draft the new Serbian Constitution has outlined the main aspects of the document. 
After a committee meeting Thursday (19 June), chairman Vladan Batic said the basic decrees have been hammered out. 
They establish that Serbia is a republic, that Serbian is the official language and that Belgrade is the capital. 
Incorporated principles include the rule of law and separation of church and state. 
Earlier this week, Batic said the draft would likely be approved by year's end, and would be followed by a referendum on the constitution in February.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- International community High Representative Paddy Ashdown fired 60 Bosnian Serb officials Wednesday (30 June) over the failure to arrest top war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
Those removed included Parliament Speaker Dragan Kalinic, a wartime ally of Karadzic, and Interior Minister Zoran Djeric.
"I decided to remove these people from public and party positions," Ashdown told a press conference.
He has sweeping powers to remove officials seen as obstructing the peace process under the 1995 Dayton Accord.
The failure to arrest war crimes indictees prevented BiH from receiving an invitation to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme during this week's Istanbul summit.
Ashdown described that as a "major setback for anyone who wants to see this country become a stable and prosperous European democracy".
Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic issued a statement Tuesday urging Ashdown to be "moderate", for the sake of the reform process.

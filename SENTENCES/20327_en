ANKARA, Turkey -- A leader of the armed unit of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has instructed its members to conduct terrorist attacks in September and in October, the daily Milliyet said Wednesday (September 12th).
In coded telegrams, a Syrian-born PKK leader, known as Dr.
Bahoz Erdal, reportedly told members of the terrorist organisation they were free to perform all sorts of attacks but urged them to avoid taking human lives.
Meanwhile, Turkish authorities investigating a foiled attempt to plant a large bomb in a busy part of the capital are focusing on the PKK.
The Ankara governor's office said on Wednesday that the explosive device was similar to ones used by Kurdish militants in 2005 and 2006 and weighed more than 600 kg.
A mobile phone was to have been used to detonate the bomb, a favourite method of PKK bombers.
In other news, Turkish troops killed four PKK rebels in a clash in the southeastern province of Siirt.
Turkey's newly elected President Abdullah Gul toured Kurdish-dominated areas in the region on Wednesday, urging national unity and solidarity.

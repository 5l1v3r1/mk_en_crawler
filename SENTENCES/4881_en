Music and dance lovers are gearing up for the opening of the third annual Refresh Festival on Thursday (July 30th) in the ancient city of Kotor.
This year, the spotlight will be focused on the DJ stage at the Maximus discotheque, which will host some of the biggest names in techno and house music.
World renowned French house DJ and producer Bob Sinclar will headline this year's four-day festival, which is about to blow a burst of cool electronic dance music onto the scorching Montenegrin coast.
It kicks off with progressive house legend, English DJ and producer Steve Lawler.
His countryman, Darren Emerson, will headline Saturday.
Swedish techno artist Adam Beyer will be sandwiched between the two DJs Friday.
"World, Hold On", which climbed to the top of Billboard's Club Play Songs chart in 2006, was Bob Sinclar's call for global peace, but when he drops that bomb on Sunday night, his fans will explode on the dance floor.
While the techno crowd is cutting a rug on the second floor, the hip hop hordes downstairs will be shaking their booties to AJs Nigrutin and Sky Wikluh, with acts from across the region.
With an emphasis on house and techno, Refresh held an open call to discover new DJs.
From a pool of hundreds of respondents, four have been selected to open for the headliners.
"We are very proud of a large number of young people that applied for the open call.
We had the chance to realise the DJ scene in Montenegro has many young and talented DJs," Media Manager Marija Vujovic said.
"I was at the Refresh last year, so I am really looking forward to this year's event.
I know it will be fantastic, I am going with great friends and we are going to be partying until dawn," said Podgorica resident Marko, 21.
"I love techno and house!
I will be at the DJ stage throughout the whole festival.
I am really excited about the DJs they brought this year," said 19-year old Milena, of Kotor.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency urged on Wednesday (22 June) that Prime Minister Adnan Terzic consult immediately with representatives of the main BiH parties to settle the crisis in the Council of Ministers.
At issue is a controversy surrounding the resignation of BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.
Earlier this month, following a dispute over administrative appointments, Terzic accepted Ivanic's resignation, which was submitted last December.
But Ivanic refused to step down, saying the prime minister's move was illegal.
The BiH Parliament has yet to decide the matter.

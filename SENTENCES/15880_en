WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos warned on Wednesday (16 August) that recently discovered footage allegedly showing war crimes against Serbs should not be politically exploited in the former Yugoslavia. 
"Atrocities were committed by all sides of the conflicts with varying levels of planning and organisation, and we condemn any attempts to exploit these tragedies for political advantage," he said. 
Gallegos went on to say that countries in the region should move beyond the collectivisation of guilt and should focus instead on holding individuals accountable for crimes.

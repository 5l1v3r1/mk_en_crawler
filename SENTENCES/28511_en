BUCHAREST, Romania -- Thousands of farmers blocked the area around the government building in Bucharest on Tuesday (May 11th), demanding the resignation of all officials at the Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry, due to alleged incompetence. 
The protestors, who arrived by tractors they parked outside the cabinet's headquarters, are demanding government subsidies for fuel and irrigation water that they say are late.
In other news Tuesday, the country's five biggest labour unions announced they are planning four days of protests outside the government and presidential building in Bucharest. 
They are demonstrating against what the unions describe as the "unacceptable measures" hammered out by the government and the IMF. 
The protests begin on Thursday.
Jeffrey Franks, head of the IMF mission to Romania, said on Tuesday that the Fund offered a balanced mix of measures to reach the 2010 fiscal targets, adding it was Romanian authorities who opted for mostly spending cuts over tax hikes.

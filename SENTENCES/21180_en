SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The professionalism demonstrated by the Macedonian troops in Afghanistan demonstrates that the country deserves membership in NATO, said Captain Mice Kotevski, commander of the contingent. 
Kotevski spoke at a ceremony in Ohrid on Tuesday (July 31st), celebrating the return of the 126 troops after a six month tour of duty. 
They served in the UK contingent and were responsible for guarding the command staff in Kabul, military bases and communication facilities.

TIRANA, Albania -- Businesses in Albania have little or no sense of social responsibility, according to a UNDP-sponsored survey published on Monday (June 23rd).
The report points to the low level of involvement by businesses in terms of donations, social assistance or financial support.
"It is important to underline that Albanian companies don't donate money to charity," UNDP representative Marina Kaneti said, adding that state structures must do more.

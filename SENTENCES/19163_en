NEW YORK, United States -- Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu departed New York Thursday (November 30th) after meetings with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, special envoy Martti Ahtisaari, and ambassadors of the countries that serve as permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
A press release from Sejdiu's office said the president and Annan exchanged views on the situation in Kosovo and the status issue. 
Sejdiu said Kosovo will wait for Ahtisaari's proposal and that no further delays are expected. 
"It is not only for Kosovo, but also for the international community, important to solve status as soon as possible," he said.
Annan, meanwhile, is calling on Kosovo's leaders to preserve stability and continue with reforms. 
"High expectations on the part of Kosovo Albanians, coupled with recent speculations about a possible delay in the process, have led to a feeling of uncertainty as to the way ahead and are likely to be a source of instability if momentum slows," he acknowledged in his latest report to the Security Council, released Thursday. 
Warning that the situation could be exploited by radical groups, he urged the Kosovo cabinet to communicate with the public and to move ahead with a reform agenda that includes building democratic institutions, enforcing minority rights, creating a functioning economy and setting up an impartial legal system.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The economy is showing signs of recovery and will consolidate growth this year on the back of continuously robust exports and growing domestic demand, Jeffrey Franks, the IMF mission chief for Romania, told a press conference Tuesday (February 8th).
He expects GDP to grow by a 1.5% this year and by over 4.0% in 2012.
Franks also noted that Romanian authorities have fulfilled the commitments assumed during the previous review mission.
The seventh IMF review mission ended on Tuesday, together with the stand-by loan agreement Romania has with the Fund, because officials decided not to withdraw the last tranche.

NEW YORK, United States -- Visiting EU security chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday (January 9th) that the plan for the future status of Kosovo would be presented in early February at the latest. 
Solana's statement followed a meeting with new UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York. 
They discussed various crisis regions, describing Kosovo as a priority for the EU and the UN.
Kosovo was also the focus of talks Tuesday between the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos and the UN special envoy for the status discussions, Martti Ahtisaari, in Madrid. 
Moratinos reiterated the OSCE's determination to remain engaged in Kosovo after status is resolved.
In other news, UNMIK deputy chief Steven Schook dismissed allegations that the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) abused its powers during a recent raid of a mainly Serbian populated village, following the murder of a KPS member. 
Belgrade and local Serb residents had protested tactics allegedly used by the Kosovo police in searches last week.

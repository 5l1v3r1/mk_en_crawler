BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vujadin Popovic, a former Bosnian Serb army officer wanted by the UN tribunal, has surrendered to Serbian authorities and will travel to The Hague this week, the government in Belgrade announced Friday (8 April). 
He would be the 11th Serb fugitive to give himself up since the beginning of the year. 
Popovic, 48, was a colonel in the Drina Corps and was charged with genocide in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
That leaves wartime RS military commander Ratko Mladic as the sole Srebrenica fugitive still at large. 
On Friday, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic again denied allegations that Mladic was hiding on territory of the federal union, reiterating that the federal army does not protect war crimes suspects.

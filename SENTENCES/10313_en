BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen voiced satisfaction Thursday (23 September) with Turkey's reforms. 
After a meeting in Brussels with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Verheugen said there are "no more obstacles" on the country's path towards opening accession talks. 
The meeting focused on Turkey's delay in adopting a new penal code, which has troubled EU officials. 
The Turkish Parliament has now decided to reconvene Sunday to discuss the code and a controversial clause that would outlaw adultery. 
The EU has urged Ankara to drop that provision.

NEW YORK, United States -- The foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece on Thursday (25 September) signed the international treaty banning the production and use of landmines. 
Abdullah Gul and George Papandreou noted that this reflected the rapid improvement of relations between the two former rivals.
<I>USA Today</I> reported, meanwhile, that Turkish officials have told the Pentagon that Ankara is prepared to dispatch 10,000 troops to help stabilise Iraq if the UN Security Council passes a new resolution by year's end. 
In a related development, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told NTV television on Thursday that Turkey would expect US forces to take action against Turkish Kurd rebels based in northern Iraq in return for peacekeepers. 
The rebel group KADEK, formerly known as the Kurdistan Worker's Party, called off a four-year-long unilateral truce last month.

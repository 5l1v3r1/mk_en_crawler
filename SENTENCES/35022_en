ATHENS, Greece -- A strike by Olympic Airways cabin staff forced the airline to cancel 26 flights on Sunday (30 November) after talks with a labour union broke down the previous day.
More than 50 flights have been cancelled since the strike started three days ago.
A trade union official said the action would continue Monday despite a court ruling that found it "illegal and abusive".
The workers are protesting government plans for restructuring and subsequent privatisation.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Trade unions representing public sector employees are not content with discussions held on Monday (October 5th) with delegations of the labour and finance ministries, led by Prime Minister Emil Boc himself. 
The talks came amid a general strike of some 750,000 public sector employees launched earlier in the day in protest of the planned downsizing of the public sector, as well as the so-called single wage bill, which will in effect freeze pay in the sector for an indefinite period. 
Union leaders said after the meeting that none of their requests have been met and threatened to go on strike indefinitely. 
According to Aurel Cornea, head of the Federation of Free Unions in Education, protests in each public sector have already been agreed upon, following all legal steps up to a general strike.
Finance Minister Gheorghe Pogea confirmed to unions that the government plans more job cuts, most likely during the enforcement of the so-called single wage bill. 
On the other hand, Boc told unions that the government has the necessary funds for pensions, salaries and social indemnities in 2009 and 2010.

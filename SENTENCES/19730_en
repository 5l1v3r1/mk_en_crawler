BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albanian President Bamir Topi met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels on Thursday (October 25th). 
While Barroso expressed support for the judicial and electoral reforms undertaken in Albania, he also reiterated that political problems in the country must be addressed.
Topi also met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who congratulated him on attempts to moderate the political climate in Albania by establishing lasting dialogue between the majority and the opposition. 
Topi assured Rehn that he would step up such efforts so key judicial sector reforms are addressed immediately.

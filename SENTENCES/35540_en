SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Skopje Mayor Risto Penov, who leads the smallest government partner, the Liberal Democratic Party, announced on Wednesday (9 June) that he would seek a third term in office during the local elections this autumn. 
Still unclear, however, is whether the senior government party, SDSM, would support him this time or nominate its own candidate. 
Penov won his first mandate with the help of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE and his second with the support of SDSM.

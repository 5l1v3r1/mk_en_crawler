PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX Commander Yves de Kermabon said Monday (July 7th) that even after UNMIK ends the process of its reconfiguration, the EU mission will report to Brussels and not to the UN.
"This is a very different mission aimed to help, advise and monitor Kosovo institutions.
EULEX is under the command of the EU," de Kermabon said after meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and President Fatmir Sejdiu.
De Kermabon noted that there could be difficulties in extending EULEX to the Serb-dominated northern part of Kosovo, but he said the mission will deploy nonetheless.

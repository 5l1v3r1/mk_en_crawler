BELGRADE, Serbia -- G17, a member of Serbia's ruling coalition, says it will back President Boris Tadic if he seeks re-election. 
Tadic is leader of the Democratic Party. 
Suzana Grubjesic, a member of the G17 leadership, said on Sunday (August 26th) that G17 believes the ruling coalition should come up with a single candidate for president and that the presidential and local elections should not be held simultaneously. 
G17 would like to see the presidential vote this year, and local elections in the spring. 
The third party in the coalition, DSS-NS, has not decided whether to back Tadic or nominate its own candidate.

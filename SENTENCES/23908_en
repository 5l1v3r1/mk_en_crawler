TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) urged the government Tuesday (January 20th) to prepare an emergency plan to improve the procedure for issuing new electronic ID cards and biometric passports. 
Registration began on January 12th, but the process has hit major organisational problems. 
SMI Secretary General Petrit Vasili says there is not enough time to issue ID cards to Albanians living abroad. 
He also asked for an extended public awareness campaign on the process. 
The ID cards are considered crucial to holding transparent parliamentary elections in June.

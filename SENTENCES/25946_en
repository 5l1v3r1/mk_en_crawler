BUCHAREST, Romania -- Subway workers are continuing their strike Wednesday (November 18th) for a second day. 
The subway, which is used by about 650,000 people every day, was closed between 4 am and 4 pm on Tuesday, after employees walked off their jobs demanding higher pay. 
They have agreed to an 18% increase, compared to their initial demands for 26%. 
Traffic in Bucharest was snarled on Tuesday.

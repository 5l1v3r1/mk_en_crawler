COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The Turkish government will submit its reform plan to the EU by 8 December, says ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
During a visit to Copenhagen on Tuesday (26 November), Erdogan told TV channel TR2 that parliament will fast track economic reform legislation, in a bid to pass it before the EC Council summit in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December.
In exchange, Ankara hopes to receive a firm date for the launch of accession talks.
Turkey applied for membership in April 1987, earlier than any of the other current candidates.

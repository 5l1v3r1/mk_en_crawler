BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police have arrested seven people suspected of involvement in human trafficking, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Monday (February 28th). 
Investigators say they are responsible for smuggling 18 Kosovo Albanians in 2009, 15 of whom drowned when their boat sank in the Tisa River separating Serbia and Hungary. 
Dacic says the ring has managed to transfer dozens of illegal immigrants via Serbia to Hungary. 
Serbian police acted in co-operation with the police services of Hungary and Austria.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The head of Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said Wednesday (1 September) that a special search would be conducted for wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. 
Representatives of the international community may also participate, Ljajic said. 
He added that searches conducted over the past month have disproved allegations about Mladic's whereabouts.
In other news, Goran Svilanovic, the leader of the Civil Alliance of Serbia and former Serbia-Montenegro foreign minister, urged Kosovo Serbs to take part in the 23 October parliamentary elections in the province. 
Svilanovic said the Serbian government should encourage participation in the vote, once the international community provides security guarantees.

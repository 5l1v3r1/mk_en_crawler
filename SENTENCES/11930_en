BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister-designate Pero Bukejlovic has started consultations on forming a new entity cabinet. 
He met on Monday (17 January) with leaders of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), which nominated him. 
Afterwards, SDS issued a statement saying it fully backed the government concept offered by Bukejlovic, including its intention to boost co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Bukejlovic was tapped for prime minister earlier this month after the entire cabinet resigned in the wake of international sanctions.
Also Monday, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic said 49 Bosnian Army ordnance experts are training for deployment in Iraq. 
In April, 36 of them will be selected to help destroy ammunition dumps there, under US command.

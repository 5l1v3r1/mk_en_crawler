ATHENS, Greece -- Public transport in Athens will be paralysed on Wednesday (December 8th) due to a strike against wage and bonus cuts in the sector and reorganisation of state-controlled companies. 
The 24-hour action comes a day after a visit by IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, which triggered protests. 
Hundreds of pensioners rallied against government austerity measures that are being implemented in line with commitments made under the 110 billion-euro bailout package granted by the EU and IMF. 
After meeting with senior officials, Strauss-Kahn said Greece should work to recover its economic growth and he urged the EU to extend the repayment period of the Greek loan. 
He expressed confidence that Greece will be able to return to growth in 2012 after three consecutive years of recession. 
Prime Minister George Papandreou thanked Straus-Kahn for supporting the idea of extending the repayment period.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Thirty-eight families representing the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian minorities were moved from a lead-contaminated camp in northern Kosovo to a neighbourhood in northern Mitrovica on Tuesday (February 1st). 
The construction of new houses for these families was financed by the EU, which is leading a 5m-euro reintegration project that also includes medical screening and treatment.

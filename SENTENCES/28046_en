SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) Prime Minister Mustafa Mujezinovic said on Wednesday (April 21st) he will not resign as war veterans insist, but assured them that the government will discuss their demands.
About 70 people, half of them policemen, were injured when a protest by thousands of war veterans turned violent in Sarajevo on Wednesday.
Police clashed with protesters as they tried to storm the government building and set it on fire.
About 5,000 of the veterans gathered to protest a government resolution that would reduce by 20% the number of war veterans and their families who receive social aid.
They say that austerity measures have disproportionately affected them.

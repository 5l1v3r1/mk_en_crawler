SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A lawyer for some of the families of the victims of the Srebrenica massacre told reporters Saturday (8 November) that he would file lawsuits against the UN and the Dutch government. 
The families are accusing the international organisation and the Netherlands of failing to protect the Muslim enclave when it was overrun by Serb forces in July 1995. 
The survivors are seeking $1 billion in compensation and hope to reach an out-of-court settlement. 
The lawyer sent a letter to the UN last year demanding the same amount of compensation for his clients but never received an answer.

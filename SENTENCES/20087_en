ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court announced on Monday (March 17th) that it will consider a request to outlaw the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) for allegedly trying to turn Turkey from a secular to an Islamic country.
Chief prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Sabih Kanadoglu, filed the request on Friday.
If the high court decides to ban the AKP, its leaders will be barred from political activity for the next five years.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn criticised the request Monday, saying any attempt to ban the AKP is incongruous with democratic rules.
He said political issues should be discussed in parliament and resolved through elections, not in court.

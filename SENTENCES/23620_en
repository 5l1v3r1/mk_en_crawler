BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Montenegro is efficiently fulfilling its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and is quickly moving towards accession, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in Brussels on Sunday (March 22nd) after a meeting with Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen.
Montenegro has strengthened its administrative capacity, implemented legal reforms and undertook efforts to combat organised crime and corruption, said Rehn to TV Crna Gora.
"It is encouraging that the government, all political parties, the society and the social partners are committed to Montenegro's European integration," Rehn said.

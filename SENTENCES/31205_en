PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU has officially confirmed that Pieter Feith will no longer be exercising the role of an EU Special Representative (EUSR) in Kosovo, media reported on Saturday (April 30th).
Feith also holds the post of International Civilian Representative (ICR) in Kosovo.
EU diplomats have told the Koha Ditore daily that there is confusion in Brussels over the presence in Kosovo.
"The only thing that is known is that Pieter Feith can no longer exercise the post of EUSR.
Nothing else is known because there is no other formal decision on anything," an EU diplomat said, adding that there are more questions than answers regarding the EU presence.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The inter-institutional council on NATO integration decided on Monday (19 July) that a project on Bulgaria's security strategy should be prepared by the end of October.
Deputy Prime Minister Plamen Panayotov is chairman of the council.
The consultancy council on national security recently urged the government and parliament to rethink participation in military missions abroad.
In other news Monday, the government has decided to restrict the companies that would be allowed to participate in the army's modernisation tenders.
According to a draft paper from the defence ministry, contractors should come from NATO or EU member states, or a state that guarantees the meeting of NATO and EU standards.
Contractors must also have the potential for strategic partnership with the Bulgarian military industry.

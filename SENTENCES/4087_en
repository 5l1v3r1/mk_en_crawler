Fifty-six people were arrested last month in a police sting against drug traffickers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The action, dubbed "Leotar", was initiated on the orders of the Court and Prosecution Office.
Over the course of four days, police from both entities in BiH searched 200 locations across the country.
The searches were conducted in Zenica, Mostar, Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Capljina, Trebinje and Stolac.
The most extensive action, however, was conducted in Bileca, a southeastern town close to the border with Montenegro.
Police say they broke up the so-called "Bileca Group", suspected not only of cross-border drug trafficking but also arms trafficking and resale of stolen vehicles.
Eleven members of the gang were arrested.
They have been linked to several criminal organisations that were recently disbanded in Croatia.
Marica Culum, a prominent Banja Luka attorney, was among those arrested.
She allegedly directed the group together with three close associates -- Nikola Glusac, Zeljko Ilic and Goran Svorcan.
Operation Leotar was the result of several extensive activities planned and conducted since January.
It is part of continued efforts by police in BiH, Croatia and Montenegro to fight the drug trade, terrorism, human trafficking and other serious crimes.
Following the sting, representatives of the three countries' police forces met in Trebinje to discuss co-ordinating efforts.
They issued a declaration pledging continued co-operation and joint action.
"It is too little to say that our police forces co-operate;
they work together and the preceding activities are not to be singled out as only momentary ones;
they are continuous and shall go on," RS Police Director Uros Pena told reporters after the meeting.
Vicenzo Coppola, head of the EU Police Mission in BiH, praised Operation Leotar, calling it a serious blow against international drug trafficking

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal approved on Monday (20 February) the delivery of additional documents requested by the tribunal, including 36 related to Ratko Mladic. 
According to council chairman Rasim Ljajic, these were not part of Mladic's personal file and include information about the names Mladic used while being treated in Belgrade hospitals from 1993-1997, as well as the names of individuals authorised to pick up his pension.
In related news Monday, Vladeta Jankovic, deputy leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia and adviser to Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, said the Mladic case would be settled very soon. 
At the same time, local media reports are suggesting Mladic could be in custody within ten days. 
Rumours of an impending Mladic surrender or arrest have circulated numerous times in the past, without leading to a result.
Also Monday, the Belgrade district court issued an international arrest warrant for Bogoljub Karic, former majority owner of the GSM operator Mobtel. 
He fled the country amid charges of fraud and abuse of office.

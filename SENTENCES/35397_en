BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- G17 Plus, one of the major parties in Serbia's ruling coalition, will support Boris Tadic for president, according to party leader Miroljub Labus. 
Tadic was nominated by the Democratic Party, which was left out of the democratic ruling coalition. 
He faces ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic in the 27 June run-off. 
Ruling coalition candidate Dragan Marsicanin came in fourth in Sunday's (13 June) first round. 
International monitors confirmed on Monday that the elections met OSCE standards.

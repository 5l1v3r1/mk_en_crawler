ANKARA, Turkey -- Istanbul's chief prosecutor Aykut Cengiz Engin on Tuesday (April 6th) ordered the dismissal of the two prosecutors who are believed to have ordered as many as 90 arrests in connection with the Ergenekon probe. 
The dismissals follow the arrests on Monday of a group of officers, including four generals, as part of the investigation. 
According to local media, the detentions -- which numbered between 14 and 20, according to varying reports -- were carried out in 14 cities.

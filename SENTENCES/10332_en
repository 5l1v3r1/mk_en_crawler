SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A recent survey suggests a broad public perception that the country's administration is corrupt, according to the Institute for Solidarity, Democracy and Civil Society, which presented the results Tuesday (23 November). 
The polling agency said 68.2 per cent of respondents view the Macedonian administration as corrupt, while only 11.2 per cent believe otherwise. 
In addition, 41.6 per cent said they do not trust any of the current political leaders. 
The survey was conducted Sunday, after Hari Kostov's resignation as prime minister. 
Kostov cited corruption as one of the reasons for his decision.

ATHENS, Greece -- The organisers of the 2004 Olympics, aided by Greek police, have launched an operation against counterfeiters of Olympic souvenirs. 
Six undercover officers have been posing as shoppers in Athens since Sunday (2 June). 
The Olympic Organising Committee has signed contracts with 19 Greek companies for the production of the souvenirs. 
Sales prior to the games are expected to reach $900m, with organisers getting 10 per cent of the revenues.In May, the police seized 13,500 fakes from a warehouse operated by a Chinese national.

ATHENS, Greece -- An investigation by auditors from the Bank of Greece has found no evidence of politicians' involvement in an improper real-estate deal between the state and the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. 
In a report delivered to Parliament Speaker Dimitris Sioufas on Tuesday (April 28th), the auditors examined monastery bank accounts and transactions. 
The Vatopedi case caused a major political scandal last year that led to the resignations of Merchant Marine Minister George Voulgarakis and government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos. 
They faced charges of involvement in a deal that awarded the monastery prime, state-owned real estate in exchange for cheap rural land, which resulted in losses of at least 100m euros to the state.
In other news, a small private plane crashed on the island of Cephallonia late Tuesday. 
Two Israeli nationals onboard died.

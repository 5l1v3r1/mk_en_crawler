SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria closed Chapter 9 on Transport Policy in EU accession talks Monday (2 June). 
The Bulgarian negotiating team and the EU also held talks on the Competition Policy Chapter. 
The number of chapters closed by the country reached 24 out of a total of 30. 
The foreign ministry plans to close the remaining technical chapters by the end of this month.
Also Monday, Romania closed two more negotiation chapters with the EU -- Free Movement of Goods and Taxation -- on the first day of the Romania-EU accession conference in Brussels. 
According to Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, the completion of talks on these chapters represents a step toward recognition as a fully functioning market economy and free participation of Romanian business agents in the EU market. 
He said the negotiations on the other two chapters that the country hopes to close this week -- Free Movement of People and Competition Policy -- would continue over the coming days.

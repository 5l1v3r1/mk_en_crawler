ZAGREB, Croatia -- The leader of the Croatian Independent Democrats, Zlatko Canjuga, urged Parliament Friday (15 November) to discuss his proposal for a new defence law that would abolish military service. 
Canjuga maintains that since Croatia is under no threat of war, it needs to orient itself towards demilitarisation, regional stability, admission to NATO and the fight against terrorism.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Institutional leaders will co-operate with two international missions -- UNMIK and EULEX -- even after Kosovo's new constitution enters into force on June 15th, President Fatmir Sejdiu indicated on Monday (June 9th).
UNMIK and EULEX will have the same approach to help institutions safeguard the territorial integrity and the rule of law and order, Sejdiu added.
He also said that Kosovo authorities expect to receive guidelines from UN headquarters in New York on the future of UNMIK and its possible reconfiguration.

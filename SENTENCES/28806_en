PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The European Commission (EC) will not send a special mission to monitor the upcoming local election in Montenegro, the head of the EC delegation in Podgorica, Leopold Maurer, said on Friday (April 9th). 
The comment came after a request of the opposition Movement for Changes (PzP), which earlier asked the EU's executive arm to provide international monitoring to prevent possible violations during the May 23rd vote. 
The OSCE has also said that it would not send observers for the elections.

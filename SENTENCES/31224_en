BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecutor's office announced on Thursday (March 3rd) it is dropping the case against Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda due to lack of evidence.
Deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric said that 44 witnesses had been interrogated both in Serbia and Croatia during the investigation.
According to him, the case is an example of good regional co-operation with the state prosecutor's offices of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Tihomir Purda was detained last month at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant.
Authorities in Belgrade suspected him of involvement in war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar early in the 1992-1995 conflict.

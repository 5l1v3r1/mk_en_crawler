BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Parliament's Rapporteur for Macedonia Zoran Thaler said on Thursday (September 16th) that he expects the European Commission's November report on the country to be positive.
After talks with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Brussels, he praised Macedonia for the progress it's made in reforms but said more work remains.
Thaler also encouraged Skopje to be more active in resolving the long-standing name row with Greece.
While in Brussels, Gruevski also met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, briefing him about the reforms Skopje is implementing in order to meet EU criteria.
Gruevski said the Union should consider the option of setting a starting date for accession talks even if the dispute with Athens is not settled.
He said Macedonia has been working to resolve the issue, but Greece may not be.

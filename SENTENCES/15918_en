NEW YORK, United States -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said Tuesday (18 April) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) must assume full responsibility for its affairs, as a normal and democratic European state.
Addressing the UN Security Council, he said the phase of postwar reconstruction and strong international supervision is coming to an end and the country is moving into the next stage, which he called "ownership".
This entails a BiH capable of running its own affairs and integrating into Euro-Atlantic structures, he said.
The speech was Schwarz-Schilling's first to the Council since assuming his post in February.
He outlined three priorities for the year:
constitutional reform, the general elections in October, and negotiations with the EU on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
At the same time, he warned that Sarajevo must improve its co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

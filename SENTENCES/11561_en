SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Regional co-operation is the cornerstone of EU integration for countries in the Western Balkans, according to the chairperson of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Southeast European countries.
During a lecture in Skopje on Thursday (21 July), Doris Pack said the comparatively low level of democratic development, mistrust among countries and ethnic tensions are considered the main barriers to strengthening regional co-operation.
As for the accession process, Pack stressed that there will be no compromises and all candidates will have to meet the EU's democratic values and standards.
She added that in the case of Macedonia, its name dispute with Greece poses no barrier to accession.

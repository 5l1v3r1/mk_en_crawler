ATHENS, Greece -- Greeks marked the 187th anniversary of independence on Tuesday (March 25th).
A revolt on the same day in 1821 initiated a lengthy and ultimately successful struggle against the Ottoman Empire.
Celebrations and parades are being held around the country, including in Athens.
In New York, meanwhile, another critical round of negotiations is being launched to resolve Greece's long-running name dispute with Macedonia.
The representatives from the two countries, Greece's Adamantios Vasilakis and Macedonia's Nikola Dimitrov, are meeting with UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz.

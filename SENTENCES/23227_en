TIRANA, Albania -- The Republican Party (RP) warned on Tuesday (September 30th) it may run on its own in next year's elections, thus ending its partnership with the ruling Democratic Party.
"The Republican Party has its own electorate and potential," said RP leader and former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu.

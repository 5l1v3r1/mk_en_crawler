YEREVAN, Armenia -- US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday (July 4th) urged Turkey to make a step forward in its ties with Armenia and open the common border between the two countries.
"We urge both sides continue to try to find the opportunities to open doors to reconciliation and normalisation," Clinton told a press conference in Yerevan after meeting Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian.
Yerevan and Ankara signed two landmark protocols in October 2009 to establish diplomatic relations and open their common border after decades of hostility.
But ratification of the documents by the two countries' parliaments has stalled over genocide claims against Turkey as well as Ankara's support for Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Monday (October 2nd) that his country would back a settlement to the Kosovo status issue that would allow possible corrections later, if necessary.
Fico's comment followed a meeting with Serbian counterpart Vojislav Kostunica, who was visiting Bratislava.
In other news, over 1,000 Serbs from northern Kosovo participated in a rally in Mitrovica on Monday, to protest the reopening of the bridge between the two ethnically divided parts of the city.
UNMIK reopened the bridge late last week, following a short closure prompted by an attack on a local Serb.
Meanwhile, both Belgrade and the government in Pristina have condemned the bombing late Sunday of the home of Zecir Zurapi, a representative of the Gorani minority and an adviser to the Serbian government's Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo.
No one was injured in the blast.

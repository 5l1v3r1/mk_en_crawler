THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj pleaded not guilty Monday (14 March) to charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from his role in the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.
At his first appearance before the UN tribunal, he rejected all 37 counts in the indictment against him, which includes charges of murder, rape and persecution of Serb, Roma and Albanian civilians.
Haradinaj, 35, surrendered to the tribunal last week.

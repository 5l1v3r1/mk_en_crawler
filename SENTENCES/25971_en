COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- During his speech at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Thursday (December 17th) that Tirana is committed to respecting international and EU standards on climate and producing green energy.
"My government's objectives are to make Albania a small power of green energy in the region," said Berisha.
He added that 95% of Albania's energy is produced by hydro power plants and called on international institutions to help companies invest more in the country.
"Two-thirds of the hydro potential is still to be utilised.
We plan to build 440 hydro power plants, while 130 are already under way," Berisha said.

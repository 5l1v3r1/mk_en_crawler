BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Polish Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said Saturday (3 May) that a ten-nation peacekeeping force will be deployed in Iraq by the end of May. 
The country will be divided into three zones, with the United States, Great Britain and Poland each managing one of them. 
International media quoted US officials as saying that Albania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Italy, Spain, Denmark and the Netherlands are the seven other nations contributing to the new force. 
The Bulgarian and Albanian troops would likely serve under Polish or British command.
In other news, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy met with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Sunday. 
They focused on the reconstruction of post-war Iraq, especially Bulgaria's potential contributions to the high-tech sector. 
Rebuilding Iraq was also the focus of talks Passy held Saturday with his Kuwaiti counterpart.

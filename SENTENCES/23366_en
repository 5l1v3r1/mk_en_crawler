ANKARA, Turkey -- Eight patients were killed in a fire at a hospital in the northwest city of Bursa, Governor Sahabettin Harput said on Tuesday (May 26th). 
The fire broke out overnight due to an electrical issue. 
Eight patients, three of them women, died at the hospital's intensive care unit. 
Emergency workers managed to evacuate all other patients. 
The governor said it was not clear whether the victims died of smoke inhalation, or due to the failure of life support equipment, left without power in the fire.

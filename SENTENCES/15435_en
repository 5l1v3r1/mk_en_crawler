BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The outgoing EUFOR Commander, Italian Major General Gian Marco Chiarini, says EUFOR has no information to suggest war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic is on BiH territory. 
In an interview published Monday (November 27th) in the Banja Luka-based newspaper Nezavisne novine, Chiarini said several tips were received during the past year about Karadzic's whereabouts, but none have panned out. 
As for a gradual pullout of EU troops from BiH, Chiarini said the current situation might make a reduction possible.
Germany's Rear Admiral Hans-Jochen Witthauer is expected to take over as EUFOR commander in early December, when Chiarini's yearlong mandate expires.

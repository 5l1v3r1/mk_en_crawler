PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbia's request to review Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence at the International Court of Justice is regrettable, Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Thursday (September 18th) in Pristina after meeting with leaders. 
Rasmussen added that Denmark's recognition of Kosovo was in full accordance with international law and that independence is an irreversible process and the only possible solution. 
He called on other countries to recognise Kosovo as well. 
In turn, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said Kosovo's future passes through Brussels and Washington, not through Belgrade.
In other news Thursday, EULEX chief Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon said he is prepared to go to Belgrade and further explain EULEX's role and mandate in Kosovo. 
The goal would be Serbian authorities accepting the mission's full deployment, including in the Serb-dominated north.
Also Thursday, Austrian diplomat Werner Almhofer became the new head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo. 
Finland, the current chair of the OSCE, nominated him. 
Almhofer, 48, will replace Switzerland's Tim Guldimann.

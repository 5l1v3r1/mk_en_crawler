WASHINGTON, United States -- The US State Department issued a report Sunday (7 March) praising Croatia's efforts to fight drug trafficking and money laundering.
The report, covering activities in 2003, urged authorities to bolster measures against organised crime, continue training its institutions and pass necessary legislation.
The report said measures against drug trafficking were among the top priorities of the state prosecutor's office and its office for the prevention of corruption and organised crime, but noted that the latter was slow in setting up rapid response teams.

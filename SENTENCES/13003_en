BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu said Thursday (29 September) that Romania is preparing to take over the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council on Saturday.
He said this will boost the country's image in the eyes of the international community and make its presence on the diplomatic stage more visible.
According to the minister, the main issues on the agenda during Romania's one-month presidency include Kosovo, Iraq, the peace process in the Middle East and reform of the Security Council.
Romania is a non-permanent member of the Council.

OSLO, Norway -- During their informal meeting in Oslo on Friday (April 27th), the NATO foreign ministers reiterated their support for the Kosovo status plan proposed by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. 
According to a spokesman for the Alliance, James Appathurai, the ministers voiced hope that the UN Security Council would pass a new resolution soon, as further delays or uncertainty could strain the situation in the Balkan region.
The NATO top diplomats also warned against any unilateral moves by Pristina that would go beyond the legitimate international process for settling Kosovo's status.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Norway's Helsinki Committee said on Monday (March 10th) that the EU-led mission to Kosovo (EULEX) must be subject to far greater scrutiny and accountability than its predecessor, UNMIK.
"If the EU wants to assist in building respect for human rights and the rule of law in Kosovo, it needs to lead by example," said a joint statement by the three human rights NGOs.
The organisations also insisted that NATO forces in Kosovo undergo closer monitoring.
The NGOs reiterated earlier criticisms of the UN mission, citing in particular the response by UNMIK police to demonstrations by the Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) movement in February 2007.
The police fired expired rubber bullets, killing two protestors and wounding others.

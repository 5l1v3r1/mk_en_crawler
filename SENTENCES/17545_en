ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Foreign and European Integration Ministry said on Monday (January 29th) that it would report to the EU and the UN over a deepening border dispute with neighbouring Slovenia.
The statement followed an exchange of diplomatic notes and accusations between Zagreb and Ljubljana.
Late last week, Slovenia criticised the extension of the Croatian oil and gas company INA's concessions to drill oil and gas in the Adriatic Sea.
It said Croatia was attempting to claim a part of the Adriatic that has not been divided among the successors of the former Yugoslavia.
In response, Croatia sent a protest note Monday, accusing Slovenia of aspiring to Croatian territory.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Several thousand people marched in downtown Belgrade on Sunday (5 October) to mark the third anniversary of the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic. 
The event was organised by the Otpor (Resistance) student movement, which spearheaded the 2001 protests against the dictator. 
Sunday's demonstrators marched to parliament to demand new general elections.
In Novi Sad, meanwhile, Tomislav Nikolic, presidential nominee of the ultra-conservative Radical Party, kicked off his election campaign.
In other news, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic announced Sunday that his cabinet has managed to achieve 95 per cent of the tasks it had set for itself over the past three years. 
Speaking to Radio Television Serbia, he said education, health care and infrastructure projects are the most obvious achievements.

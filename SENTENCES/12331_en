SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Friday (10 December) that BiH's failure to fully co-operate with The Hague tribunal is the main obstacle to its becoming a stable, peaceful and prosperous European democracy. 
He added that this non-compliance with the tribunal meant that again the country has failed to meet NATO's requirements for joining the Partnership for Peace programme. 
As for revelations that Republika Srpska's Army is protecting war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic, Ashdown said the very institutions that are supposed to arrest indictees are defending them.

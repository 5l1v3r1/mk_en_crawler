SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The UN war crimes tribunal plans to issue an indictment against former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovki and demand his extradition from Croatia, according to Macedonian and Croatian press reports. 
Citing sources close to The Hague, the newspapers say Boskovski would be charged in connection with the so-called Ljuboten case in which several ethnic Albanian civilians were killed during a police operation during the 2001 conflict in Macedonia. 
Boskovski, who holds dual citizenship, was apprehended in Croatia last summer on an international arrest warrant issued by Skopje. 
He is charged in connection with the 2002 murders of seven immigrants from Pakistan and India.

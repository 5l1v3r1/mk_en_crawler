BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday (April 8th) that the Union should offer to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia now, to boost the prospects of pro-European parties ahead of the parliamentary elections next month.
The SAA was initialled in November, but signing always has been contingent on Serbian co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Solana told the European Parliament on Tuesday that the EU must do all it can to prevent nationalist forces from taking power.
Most of the parties themselves rejected the idea.
The nationalist, populist and often anti-Western parties, such as the Serbian Radical Party, Serbia's Democratic Party (DSS) of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, and the Socialist Party of Serbia accused Solana of meddling to secure a victory for parties that would recognise Kosovo's independence.
President Boris Tadic's pro-western Democratic Party was not happy either.
It urged all EU officials to refrain from interfering in Serbia's domestic affairs.
Only the Liberal Democratic Party welcomed the comments.

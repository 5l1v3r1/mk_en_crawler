LUXEMBURG -- The EU Ministerial Troika and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meet on Monday (April 23rd) in Luxemburg in an effort to clarify positions regarding the Kosovo status plan proposed by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
The troika consists of the chairman of the Council of Ministers -- currently German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier -- EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.
Diplomatic sources say they will try to convince Lavrov that Ahtisaari's proposal is the only way to stabilise the region and prevent violence.

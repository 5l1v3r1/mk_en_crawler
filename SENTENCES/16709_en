BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian and Montenegrin governments approved the agreement Thursday (6 July) regarding membership in international financial organisations and the division of financial claims and obligations.
Under it, Serbia inherits Serbia-Montenegro's membership in the World Bank, the IMF, the EBRD and the Council of Europe's Development Bank.
However, it will have to refund some membership fees to Montenegro.
The agreement also stipulates that a 5.88 per cent quota for Montenegro will be applied when dividing the state union's share of financial claims in the succession agreement of the former Yugoslavia.

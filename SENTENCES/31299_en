BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) Constitutional Court ruled on Monday (January 31st) that the Bosniaks' vital interests have not been violated by the appointment of Aleksandar Dzombic as the entity's new prime minister. 
The ruling clears the way for the new government to assume power. 
The Bosniaks insisted they have been discriminated against since none of the key positions in the entity -- parliament speaker, prime minister, Council of Peoples president, Constitutional and Higher Court presidents, and chief prosecutor -- has gone to a Bosniak. 
The Constitutional Court said that according to the constitution, no more than two of these positions may be filled by representatives of one of the constituent peoples, which is indeed the case. 
The constitution also does not stipulate that all different groups must be represented in these positions, the court added.

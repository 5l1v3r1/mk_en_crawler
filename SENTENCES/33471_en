BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers on Monday (29 September) approved the deployment of a 200-strong police force to Macedonia on 15 December, the day the current European military mission, Concordia, is due to end.
The police mission would be based in Skopje, under the command of Belgian officer Bart D'Hooge.
Its task would be to protect order, fight organised crime, and help in sensitive areas.
The EU has set aside 7.3m euros for the one-year mission.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's Humanist Party (PUR) again expressed willingness Saturday (18 December) to join efforts by the currently ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) to form a parliamentary majority.
PUR's statement came after days of uncertainty whether it would stay with its election-time coalition partner or turn to the alliance between the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, thus increasing the latter's chances of forming the new government.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tuesday's (September 18th) meeting between Serbian negotiators and EU, Russian and US envoys focused on organising face-to-face talks between the Serbian and Kosovo Albanian sides, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said. 
He added that the talks would be held at the highest level, with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and President Boris Tadic leading the Serbian delegation. 
They will reportedly propose five topics for discussion.
In other news, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku will ask EU envoy Wolfgang Ischinger to clarify remarks he made recently to The Independent. 
Ischinger was quoted as saying that Kosovo "is no longer being offered internationally supervised independence from Serbia" because of objections from Belgrade and Moscow. 
Speaking to Reuters, Ceku said the British daily may have misinterpreted Ischinger's remarks.
Also Tuesday, the new US Ambassador to Belgrade, Cameron Munter, said that resolving the Kosovo status issue and Serbia's NATO membership will boost foreign investment in the country. 
He was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgrade.

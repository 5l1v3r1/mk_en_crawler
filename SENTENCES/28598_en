PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Steering Group (ISG) fully supports Kosovo's territorial integrity and independence and says it is irrevocable. 
Following a business lunch of the 25 ISG representatives and Kosovo political leaders in Pristina on Monday (June 14th), International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith, on behalf of the Group, said that partition is not a desirable outcome. 
He called for new efforts to implement the strategy for the Serb-dominated north, and stressed the prospects for EU membership. 
"We are very encouraged by the statements of Prime Minister [Hashim Thaci] to fight organised crime and corruption. 
We all agree that it is a difficult but a necessary process ... 
because [these] are requirements for Kosovo to join the EU," Feith said.

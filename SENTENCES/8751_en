Kosovo has imposed restrictions on products from Serbia, in response to an existing Serbian ban on imports bearing the Kosovo customs seal.
SETimes talked to Trade and Industry Minister Mimoza Kusari-Lila about the reasons behind the decision.
SETimes:
Reciprocity in trade relations with Serbia is widely seen as a political decision.
How did Kosovo reflect on the decision?
Mimoza Kusari-Lila:
This decision is entirely economic, and the government is closely working with the responsible structures not to politicise the situation by creating ethnic tensions.
The intention is to get the sides back to dialogue and have a mutual recognition of the customs seals.
It means that Kosovo, with this act, it putting itself on an equal footing with the other countries.
SETimes:
What is the economic impact of the decision?
Kusari-Lila:
The most important is the direct impact for Kosovo producers, probably in increasing export goods.
Regarding the lack of Serbian goods in our market and the increase in prices, I believe that will be for a short time.
In principle, I have a green light from most Kosovo importers who are ready to find [other] markets to replace these goods.
SETimes:
Can you comment on Serbia's activities to address the Kosovo embargo in European institutions by claiming it is a unilateral decision?
Kusari-Lila:
First of all, this decision is not an embargo, but a reciprocity measure to the same actions Serbia has taken some time ago.
The only way to end this situation would be if Serbia recognises Kosovo customs seals.
SETimes:
What was the relative weight of the Serbian goods in Kosovo markets and what of those coming from other exporters Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania?
Kusari-Lila:
According to official figures, Kosovo imports over 2 billion euros worth of goods per year.
The value of goods imported from Serbia is 300m euros per year.
The biggest trade partners of Kosovo are the EU countries.
Regarding the rest of the neighbours, according to last year's figures, there were goods imported from Albania in the amount of 69m euros, 316m from Macedonia and around 11m euros from Montenegro.
SETimes:
There has been talk that Serbian goods will enter Kosovo now through Macedonia.
Will you take measures to control the origin of these goods?
Kusari-Lila:
We have not been faced with something like that until now, despite what has been talked about.
Kosovo customs has been guided to stop Serbian goods re-exported through the neighbouring countries.
SETimes:
Kosovo also taxes goods from BiH.
Were there any reactions from that country?
Kusari-Lila:
This decision was not welcomed by Bosnian authorities, even though in this case it is about applying a 10% customs tax.
There has been no [official] reaction coming to us from the authorities of BiH.
SETimes:
Will the decision have any impact on Kosovo's relations with CEFTA?
Kusari-Lila:
The decision on the reciprocity measures has been put on the table of bilateral issues and not multi-lateral issues in the CEFTA Secretariat.
This is a bilateral decision between two countries and should not influence relations with CEFTA.
Serbia has done something like that for some years, why should it present a problem in our case?
SETimes:
Were there any attempts from Serbia to solve the embargo issue?
Kusari-Lila:
Not directly so far, but as you know, the EU has been the mediator until now and that situation continues to be in place.

TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Socialist Party (SP) and the ethnic Greek Human Rights Union Party (HRUP) signed an agreement Wednesday (21 May) on co-operation in local elections this autumn.
HRUP Chairman Ligoraq Karamelo said the agreement provides for the mutual respect of each party's platforms.
Still awaiting discussion is the issue of electoral zones in which SP would not run, but instead would support HRUP candidates.
Karamelo says agreement on such zones would ensure victory.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Thursday (14 November), NATO-led peacekeepers banned all flights by helicopters in the Muslim-Croat entity after one hovered low over SFOR barracks taking pictures. 
The ban will remain in place until the end of an investigation ordered by SFOR commander US Gen William Ward. 
The entity's defence ministry admitted it had let a film crew use one of its helicopters to shoot scenes for a movie. 
Zijad Mehic, the director of the Sarajevo film production company, said he was unaware of a rule that does not allow aircraft to fly below 300 metres over SFOR facilities. 
The producers promised to submit all tapes to the peacekeepers.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The National Security Council, under the joint chairmanship of President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, ordered all relevant authorities Friday (4 February) to step up efforts to locate and arrest fugitive General Ante Gotovina, who is wanted by The Hague tribunal.
According to a statement released after the Council's meeting, the panel also urged increased collaboration with other countries to that end.
The council plans to hold regular weekly sessions until the issue of Gotovina's arrest and extradition to The Hague -- a major condition in Croatia's EU accession bid -- is settled.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Friday (27 December) voted overwhelmingly in favour of constitutional amendments that would make it possible for Justice and Development Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan to run in a by-election.
Erdogan could be appointed prime minister if he wins a seat in the February election in Siirt province.
He was ineligible to run in the November parliamentary elections because of a 1999 conviction.
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer blocked an earlier attempt to amend the constitution, arguing that the law should not be changed for one individual.
He cannot veto the law a second time, but could challenge it in the Constitutional Court or call a referendum.
Local political observers note it would be an uphill fight, as even the sole opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party, supports the amendments.

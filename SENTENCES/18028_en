SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The European Court of Human Rights ordered Macedonia on Monday (February 19th) to pay 90,000 euros in fines for violating the right to court trials within a reasonable term.
The decision follows the latest report by Macedonia's Helsinki Committee, which concluded there was no progress in fighting court inefficiency last year.
In other news Monday, Macedonia's ruling party VMRO-DPMNE announced that it has collected 1,500 signatures to reregister the party.
A recently adopted amendment hiked the registration signatures requirement from 500 to 1,000 and requires the process every two years.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's newest political group, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), held its constituent session Tuesday (October 21st) with delegates unanimously electing former Serbian Radical Party (SRS) deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic to head the party. 
Former SRS Secretary-General Aleksandar Vucic became his deputy. 
In an interview with the AFP, Nikolic insisted the new party has abandoned nationalism. 
It will advocate co-operation with Russia but unlike the SRS would support all EU integration reforms as a means to economic revival. 
Nikolic left the SRS last month after party leaders overruled his decision to support ratification of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
In other news Tuesday, prosecutors at The Hague war crimes tribunal have launched contempt-of-court proceedings against SRS leader Vojislav Seselj for allegedly revealing the names of protected witnesses in his book. 
Publishing the identities in the book "The Hrtkovci Affair" amounts to intimidation, according to prosecutors. 
Seselj denies it. 
"I have never pressured or intimidated any of the witnesses. 
The book contains numbers and witnesses' pseudonyms." He is on trial at The Hague for the 1992 expulsion of Croat civilians from the village of Hrtkovci in Vojvodina and for crimes against the non-Serb population in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

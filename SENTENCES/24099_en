TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Saturday (March 14th) that he will leave politics if his ruling Democratic Party (DP) loses the parliamentary elections in June.
At the same time, he expressed confidence about DP's chances, given the country's "great successes, both domestic and international, for the past four years".
He said he believes voters will support the DP so he and the government can continue reforms and achieve eventual EU membership.

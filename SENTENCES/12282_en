BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Meeting in Belgrade on Friday (10 June), UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica again held talks on Kosovo.
Media reports quoted Jessen-Petersen as saying there had been progress and positive developments in Belgrade-Pristina co-operation.
He reiterated, however, the importance of participation by Kosovo Serbs in the province's institutions.
Kostunica, in turn, reiterated the Serbian government's dissatisfaction with implementation of internationally set standards, particularly regarding refugee returns.
On Friday, Kosovo Ombudsman Marek Antoni Nowicki voiced his concern over the situation of Serb returnees in Brestovnik, Belo Polje and Grace.
After touring the settlements, Nowicki said the returnees lack the most basic resources and any chance for employment.

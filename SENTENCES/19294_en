SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Five parties representing the Croat community in BiH -- the HDZ, HDZ-1990, HSP-Dapic-Jurisic, HSS and People's Party "Work for Betterment" -- agreed to issue a joint declaration on constitutional reform next month in the town of Kresevo.
Party leaders, who met in Sarajevo on Tuesday (August 28th), are still negotiating a common position regarding mid level executive power.
The declaration would serve as basis for start of constitutional reform talks.
Also Tuesday, the main Bosniak parties -- the Party for Democratic Action and Party for BiH -- said they are working on a joint platform for constitutional reform and hope to finalise it in 10-15 days, after which they would distribute it to other parties.

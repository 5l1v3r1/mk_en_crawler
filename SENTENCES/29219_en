BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country marked the 10th anniversary Tuesday (October 5th) of Slobodan Milosevic's ouster.
On October 5th 2000, several hundred thousand people gathered in Belgrade at the urging of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) to protest fraud in presidential elections.
The protesters demanded Milosevic's resignation and stormed the parliament.
The protests forced Milosevic to admit his defeat and step down, clearing the way for the DOS presidential candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, to take over the function of Yugoslav president.
Incumbent President Boris Tadic said the October 5th uprising marked the moment democracy was established.
He also voiced confidence that Serbia will accelerate its drive for eventual EU membership.
Both the EU and the United States sent congratulations on the anniversary.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Authorities announced on Wednesday (December 16th) they have received useful information from Interpol on how to find the remains of late Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, which were stolen from a cemetery on December 11th. 
Interpol will help investigators "piece together the puzzle", police spokesperson Michalis Katsounotos said, adding that while several people have been questioned, there are no suspects at this point. 
The remains of Papadopoulos, who died of lung cancer on December 12th 2008, were taken from the cemetery in the village of Deftera, near Nicosia. 
Local media have been speculating on two possible motives for the theft -- a bid for ransom from the family or an attempt to undermine ongoing reunification talks in the divided island.

They outlined four priorities:
the transfer of border control from the army to the interior ministry;
creation of a special task unit;
speedy approval of the law on crisis management;
and the balanced representation of ethnic communities in the army.
As for EU membership, Mitreva said Skopje would decide in February when to submit its application.
In other news Monday, a court in Skopje sentenced former Defence Minister Ljuben Paunovski to five and a half years in prison for embezzlement of state funds.
This marks the first time a minister has been punished for abuse of authority.

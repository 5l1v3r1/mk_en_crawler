SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko has suspended decisions of the Central Election Commission (CIK) regarding the formation of authorities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH). 
CIK spokesperson Maksida Piric confirmed on Monday (March 28th) that Inzko's decision was received. 
At its session on March 24th, the CIK annulled the election of the new FBiH president and vice-presidents after the constitutive session of the FBiH House of Peoples. 
Outgoing President Borjana Kristo had filed the complaint, arguing that both the constitution and the election law were violated during the session. 
The CIK said it annulled the vote because not all Croat seats were verified. 
The two main Croat parties, HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990, boycotted the vote.

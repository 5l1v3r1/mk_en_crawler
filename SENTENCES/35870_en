ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to hammer out Turkey's stance on Cyprus in a key meeting with generals on the National Security Council Friday (23 January), after promising a new approach to stalled peace talks concerning the divided island.
As international pressure mounts for a breakthrough in the decades-old dispute, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he saw "optimistic signals" from both sides that they were ready to break the diplomatic deadlock.
The EU said it was convinced there was a chance of a deal soon that would boost Turkey's EU membership bid.
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer echoed that sentiment during meetings Thursday in Ankara.
His Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, said his country "has been put on hold longer than enough".
He reiterated that Ankara wants a decision from the EU this year on launching accession negotiations.
In other news, the government announced that Erdogan will visit the United States next week.
His agenda includes a meeting with President George W. Bush, as well as talks with the IMF and World Bank officials.

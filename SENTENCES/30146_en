BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Romania is closer to meeting all conditions to join Schengen than Bulgaria, Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter said on Wednesday (January 19th). 
"We still have some technical problems concerning Bulgaria," Pinter added. 
His country currently holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency. 
He says the assessment came during a January 14th meeting of experts on the two countries' readiness to join the border-free zone. 
The next such meeting is on January 28th.
In related news, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi said on Tuesday that Bucharest would like the EU to decide on its Schengen accession during Hungary's presidency of the bloc, which ends in late June. 
Both Bulgaria and Romania were hoping to join Schengen this March, but the processes will likely be delayed after Germany and France insisted the two countries demonstrate more progress against corruption and organised crime.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), suggested on Monday (February 26th) the possibility for changes in the DP-led coalition cabinet, in the wake of the February 18th municipal elections. 
Berisha said the possible reshuffle was not in response to DP's election results, rather, would be in a bid to boost the pace of reforms. 
He noted however that DP should carefully consider its defeat in some major cities, including Tirana and Durres, to better prepare for future elections.
Separately Monday, the local election panel in Tirana confirmed a third term for Mayor Edi Rama and said that his Socialist Party won 21 seats on the city council, compared to 17 for the DP.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The appeals chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal upheld on Wednesday (May 19th) the 15-month sentence given Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj for contempt of court.
Seselj was convicted in July 2009 for revealing in one of his books the identities of three protected witnesses, despite a court ban on disseminating such information.
He lodged an appeal in October.
He faces separate charges for war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

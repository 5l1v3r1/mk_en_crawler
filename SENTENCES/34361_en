PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte told reporters Thursday (23 October) that witness intimidation is hampering efforts to open cases against ethnic Albanian war crimes suspects. 
Threats are obstructing efforts to get access to witnesses and persuade them to testify. 
Del Ponte confirmed that prosecutors are conducting three investigations against former Kosovo Liberation Army members. 
One of them, former commander Fatmir Limaj, has been indicted. 
Two others are under investigation but have not yet been officially charged. 
Del Ponte met with BiH High Representative Paddy Ashdown in Sarajevo Thursday. 
She is to visit officials in Banja Luka on Friday.

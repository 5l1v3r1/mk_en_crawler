BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A sergeant who deserted from the Serbia-Montenegro Army has said that senior Serbian officers are protecting former General Ratko Mladic.
Miroslav Petrovic, 25, said the UN tribunal's most wanted fugitive spent several months in Belgrade, notably in the Topcider barracks, in 2004.
Petrovic claimed that he was a member of a three-tier military structure that took care of the Bosnian Serb wartime commander during his trips between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He also said that two soldiers were murdered at Topcider because they happened to see Mladic.
The mysterious shooting caused an uproar in Serbia last year, but its circumstances were never conclusively established.
Petrovic said he deserted from the army and surrendered to KFOR in Kosovo when he was asked by senior Serbian officers to take part in a conspiracy to sell arms to ethnic Albanian separatists.
Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said Monday (11 April) that authorities are investigating the claims.

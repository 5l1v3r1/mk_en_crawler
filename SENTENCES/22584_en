SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Around 2,000 former prisoners of the 1992-1995 war in BiH gathered in front of the government building on Friday (May 9th), demanding "minimum rights and benefits". 
They said civilians and war prisoners who were held in detention centres during the conflict should receive partial disability status -- 60% and 20% respectively -- including benefits and monthly disability pay.

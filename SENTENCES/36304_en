THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Prime Minister Adnan Terzic vowed on Wednesday (26 May) that BiH authorities would assume full responsibility for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, including detention of war crimes suspects. 
Meeting with chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in The Hague, Terzic asked her to define all activities she expects the government to undertake. 
Full co-operation with The Hague tribunal is key to BiH's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown again urged five cantons in the Federation of BiH -- 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 -- to implement educational reforms in line with the State Law on Primary and Secondary Education. 
Ashdown said failing to do so would represent "a grave violation of the rule of law".

POTOCARI, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz met with American peacekeepers near Tuzla on Saturday (17 May) to mark Armed Forces Day. 
He and other US officials, including SFOR commander Gen William Ward, then visited the Memorial Centre in Potocari, where Wolfowitz placed a wreath in honour of the victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
"What happened here was one of the most horrendous tragedies in the world. 
People were brutally killed here. 
It is hard to understand," he said, after speaking with one woman who lost her husband, sons and other male relatives when Serb forces overran the UN safe haven. 
Wolfowitz said US troops would only withdraw from BiH "when other NATO countries do so".

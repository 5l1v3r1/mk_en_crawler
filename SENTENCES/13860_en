PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN special envoy Kai Eide, who is also visiting Kosovo, again urged all sides to work for the implementation of internationally set standards. 
Eide said he was disappointed with the pace of progress in resolving ongoing problems and noted that serious slippages were registered on all sides.
In other news Thursday, NATO's Admiral Harry Ulrich, commander of the Allied Joint Force Command Naples, repeated that the Pact remains committed to the security of Kosovo. 
During his day-long visit, Ulrich met with NATO and UNMIK representatives and with Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi.
On Friday, meanwhile, the Belgrade daily Politika published an interview with outgoing KFOR commander French Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon. 
In it, he explicitly rejected the notion that armed ethnic Albanian extremist groups -- including the so-called Albanian National Army -- are preparing to stage violent new attacks in Kosovo.

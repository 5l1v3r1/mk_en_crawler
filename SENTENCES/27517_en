BRUSSELS, Belgium - The European Parliament's (EP) Committee on Foreign Affairs is starting to discuss a draft of a resolution on Serbia, Serbian media reported on Wednesday (October 27th). 
The resolution will encourage Serbia's achievements in efforts to join the EU, and outline challenges the country still faces. 
According to EP Rapporteur for Serbia Jelko Kacin, who presented the draft to EP members, the resolution will urge the government to boost efforts to fight corruption and to reform the judiciary, yet will be mostly positive and will serve as a catalyst to undertaking specific reforms. 
The EP will vote on the resolution at its next session, in January. 
EP members are also expected to urge all EU member states to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia as soon as possible.

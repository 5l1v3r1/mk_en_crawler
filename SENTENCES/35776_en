SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister-designate Hari Kostov went before parliament on Monday (31 May) to outline the priorities of the new government programme.
Analysts say he demonstrated a readiness to undertake some unpopular but necessary economic reforms to curb public spending and improve the business environment.
Kostov also reiterated his commitment to implementing the Ohrid Peace Accord and to Euro-Atlantic integration efforts.
In other news, a new poll released Monday suggests growing public confidence in ethnically mixed police patrols.
The survey by the NGO Centre for Open Communications found that 46 per cent of those polled believe security has improved since the introduction of patrols in the former crisis areas.

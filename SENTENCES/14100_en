ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has invited Pope Benedict XVI to visit Turkey in 2006, the foreign ministry announced on Thursday (15 September). 
In a statement, the ministry said the proposed visit would "strengthen dialogue between civilisations". 
Sezer's move, however, effectively rules out a planned papal visit this fall. 
Benedict XVI had intended to go to Istanbul in October 2005, at the invitation of Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholemew I. 
Analysts say the government was likely concerned the trip might complicate Ankara's EU accession bid. 
The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger is on record as having opposed admitting Turkey into the bloc.

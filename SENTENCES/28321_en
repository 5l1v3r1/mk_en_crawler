BELGRADE, Serbia -- Soccer fans received payment for provoking riots during the recent European Championship qualifier between Italy and Serbia, held in Genoa, the Belgrade-based daily Politika reported on Saturday (October 16th), quoting sources close to the investigation. 
"More than 200,000 euros were paid to more than 60 hooligans for the organisation, trip, getting equipment and rioting, due to which the match in Genoa was not played," the daily reported. 
Authorities suspect that two leaders of criminal gangs ordered and financed the acts of vandalism in a bid to create chaos in Serbia.
Meanwhile, Football Federation of Serbia (FSS) President Tomislav Karadzic announced on Friday that Serbia will insist on replaying that match. 
He also said that organisers in Genoa are to blame for failing to prevent violence, as they ignored FSS' warnings about possible incidents.

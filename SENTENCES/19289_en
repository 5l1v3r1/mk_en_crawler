BELGRADE Serbia -- Incumbent President Boris Tadic told Beta on Sunday (January 27th) that if his opponent, Tomislav Nikolic, the deputy leader of Serb Radical Party (SRS), wins the presidential run-off on February 3rd, it would mean a triumph for available online Vojislav Seselj and what Tadic described as "his policy of conflicts, hatred, sanctions and isolation".
Seselj is currently on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity at the UN tribunal in The Hague.
Nikolic's campaign headquarters issued a statement Sunday in which they dubbed Tadic's campaign against Nikolic as a "Nazi" one, and one of the "dirtiest in the history of the Balkans".

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN has extended the economic powers of the Kosovo government by giving the chairmanship of the province's Economic and Fiscal Council to Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. 
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said Wednesday (22 December) that Kosovo citizens would also be appointed to top positions in other bodies such as the Banking and Payments Authority.
Also Wednesday, Kosovo's Parliament endorsed the new government programme presented by Haradinaj. 
The cabinet will focus on implementing international standards, improving the social and economic situation, the gradual assumption of competencies from UNMIK and co-operation with minorities.

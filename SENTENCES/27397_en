BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey feels it is becoming a victim of double standards in its EU accession bid, the country's European Affairs Minister Egemen Bagis said on Wednesday (September 29th). 
"We don't want any special treatment, but we don't want additional burdens either," he told a meeting titled "Turkey's Membership Process after the September 12th Referendum", at the European Policy Centre in Brussels. 
As for visa liberalisation, Bagis said that Turkey is in "a much better position" than some other countries that have already benefited from visa-free travel within the EU.

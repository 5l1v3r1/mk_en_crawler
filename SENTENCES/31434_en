SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Parliament's House of Peoples (HoP) adopted changes in the law on citizenship on Wednesday (23 April), confirming an earlier decision by the BiH House of Representatives and completing passage of the crucial legislation. 
The amendments revoke the citizenship of any individual who gained it fraudulently. 
The HoP also ratified two protocols, Protocols 12 and 13, under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, thus meeting two new post-accession criteria set by the Council of Europe.

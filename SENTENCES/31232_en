BERN, Switzerland -- The foreign affairs committee of the lower chamber of parliament says the allegations of human organ trafficking in Kosovo should be investigated by an international commission, media reported on Wednesday (February 2nd).
The panel discussed the report by Council of Europe rapporteur Dick Marty -- who is Swiss -- on Tuesday and called on the government to support such a probe.
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution based on the report in late January.

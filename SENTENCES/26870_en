SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The parliamentary caucus of the Order, Law, Justice (RZS) party fell apart Friday (December 4th) after one of its lawmakers, Mario Tagarinski, said he was leaving the group. 
The RZS, which had ten members, the minimum for forming a parliamentary group, now drops below that threshold. 
Tagarinski hasn't explained his decision, but the RZS says he was "bought" to deal a blow to the party after it warned recently against what it described as a new "coalition" between the ruling party, GERB, and President Georgi Parvanov of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

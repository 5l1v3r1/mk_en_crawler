ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Thousands of nationalist supporters gathered in Istanbul on Sunday (November 26th) to protest Pope Benedict XVI's visit. 
He arrives on Tuesday. 
Demonstrators denounced the pontiff as an enemy of Islam because in September, Benedict quoted a Byzantine emperor who said the Prophet Muhammad had brought "things only evil and inhuman". 
Local newspapers noted that Sunday's protest was significantly smaller than organisers had expected. 
A massive security operation is in effect in Istanbul, ahead of the visit.

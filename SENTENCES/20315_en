PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The EU's envoy in the new negotiations on Kosovo, Wolfgang Ischinger, said on Monday (August 13th) that he and his fellow members of the US-EU-Russia troika neither suggested nor supported partition of Kosovo as a possible solution to the province's future status.
In a comment quoted by Radio Free Europe, Ischinger said he thinks his words were misinterpreted by the media.
Reports had quoted him as suggesting the troika would accept any option agreed on by Pristina and Belgrade.
Separately, he told Deutsche Welle on Monday that Serbian and Kosovo Albanian representatives could be summoned for direct negotiations in the middle of autumn.
Well ahead of that, the troika plans to hold further discussions with each side.
It is scheduled to submit a report to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on December 10th.(Fonet, Beta, Deutsche Welle, Zeri, Tanjug, RTS, AP, B92 -13/08/07)

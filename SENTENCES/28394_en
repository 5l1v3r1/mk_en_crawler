BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) plans to challenge the new pension law at the Constitutional Court, PDS leader Victor Ponta said on Thursday (September 16th). 
The appeal will likely be submitted on Friday. 
The Chamber of Deputies approved amendments Wednesday evening, increasing the retirement age for both men and women to 65. 
Previously, men and women were able to retire 18 months and 5.5 years earlier, respectively. 
The opposition PSD and National Liberal Party boycotted the vote. 
Changes in the pension law stem from the package of austerity measures implemented in July.

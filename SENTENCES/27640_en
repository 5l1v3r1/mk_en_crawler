NEW YORK, United States -- Talks will Kosovo will start soon, Serbian President Boris Tadic told the UN General Assembly on Saturday (September 25th).
Addressing participants in the assembly's 65th session, Tadic called for patience and said the two parties need to "seek out those issues which allow confidence to be built on each side".
At the same time, Tadic reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo's independence.
"Serbia believes that the continued pursuit of recognitions is futile and counter-productive to the spirit in which we now enter.
Everyone who wanted to make their point has made it -- and we still do not have a clear settlement," Tadic said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, told the EU Council on Tuesday (September 15th) that Serbia is exerting every effort to find and arrest former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, who is charged with war crimes. 
Bildt voiced regret that the search has failed to produce results, as this is hampering efforts to implement Serbia's EU integration process. 
He said he hopes The Netherlands will agree to unblock the interim trade agreement as part of the EU's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia by the end of this year. 
Amsterdam insists Mladic be captured first.

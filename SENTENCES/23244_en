BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry said on Monday (December 29th) that Romania is assuming the rotating presidency of the Central European Initiative (CEI) in 2009 for the first time since 1996, when it became a member of the organisation.
Bucharest will take over the presidency from Bulgaria and intends to cultivate regional co-operation to support member states in their EU integration processes, the ministry said.
Romania will also work to consolidate the CEI's role as a partner in EU programmes.

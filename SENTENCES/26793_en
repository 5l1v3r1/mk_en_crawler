ZAGREB, Croatia -- Outgoing President Stjepan Mesic has reportedly said again that he would respond militarily if Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) attempted to secede.
In comments carried by regional media on Tuesday (February 9th), Mesic said he would "cut off the corridor" connecting the eastern and western portions of Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb entity.
Leaders in the entity have been warning they might attempt to hold a referendum on splitting from BiH -- a move which Mesic suggested would be a prelude to annexation by Serbia.
BiH "must survive", Mesic said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic, he added, should stress to the people of BiH that "it is their country and Sarajevo is its capital city".
Rejecting suggestions that his comments amount to warmongering, he put the blame on "Chetninkoids and Ustashoids" who are plotting to divide BiH.
Mesic will relinquish power formally next week, with Ivo Josipovic replacing him in office.

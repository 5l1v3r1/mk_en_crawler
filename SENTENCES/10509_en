ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN criminal tribunal in The Hague rejected a motion Tuesday (14 September) requesting the provisional release of two Croatian war crime indictees, Generals Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. 
Their defence attorneys expressed surprise over the decision and plan to appeal it. 
This was the second request for provisional release; one in March was also rejected. 
Markac and Cermak were indicted for crimes against humanity allegedly committed during "Operation Storm" in 1995. 
They have pleaded not guilty.

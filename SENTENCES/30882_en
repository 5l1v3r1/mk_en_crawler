ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Wednesday (February 9th) acquitted for the third time a sociologist accused of terrorism stemming from the deadly 1998 explosion at the city's Spice Bazaar. 
Sociologist Pinar Selek, who has been living in Germany since 2009, was acquitted twice before, in 2006 and 2007, but both rulings were overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeals. 
This latest acquittal can also be appealed. 
The 1998 explosion killed seven people and 127 injured.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The chairman of the International Commission on the Balkans, former Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, called on the international community to resolve the problem of Kosovo's status as soon as possible.
During visits to Pristina and Skopje late last week, Amato emphasised that the solution to Kosovo's status should guarantee the territorial integrity and sovereignty of neighbouring Macedonia.

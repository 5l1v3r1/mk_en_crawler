ATHENS, Greece -- Several women broke the thousand-year-old ban on women entering the Mount Athos monastic community on Wednesday (January 9th).
The complex, which unites about 20 Eastern Orthodox monasteries and exists within Greece as an autonomous monastic state, has been a forbidden zone for women since its establishment in 1045 AD.
The monks believe the presence of women alters the social dynamics of their community and slows their way to enlightenment.
Despite the ban, about ten women jumped a fence and stayed for about 20 minutes in a symbolic protest against the monks' claims to more than 20,000 acres of land on the Halkidiki peninsula.

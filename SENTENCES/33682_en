BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian acting president Natasa Micic plans to call new presidential elections by 1 October, according to Belgrade-based B92 Radio.Citing undisclosed sources, the broadcaster said that Micic is now ready to take the risk of holding elections prior to adoption of a new constitution. 
Under the current constitution, 50 per cent voter turnout is required for an election to be valid. 
Elections have failed twice because of failure to meet the turnout requirement.

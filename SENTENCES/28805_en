ATHENS, Greece -- A court in the town of Amfissa found police officer Epaminondas Korkoneas, 38, guilty on Monday (October 11th) of the murder of teenager Alexandros Grigoropoulos and sentenced him to life in prison.
The 15-year-old was shot in Athens on December 6th 2008, an incident that triggered weeks of violent protests across the country.
Korkoneas' patrol partner, Vassilios Saraliotis, was convicted of complicity and sentenced to ten years in prison.
Lawyers for both say they will appeal.

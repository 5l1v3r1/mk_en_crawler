MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said he is not thinking about using the Bonn powers -- which allow him to directly enact laws -- to impose a crucial police reform package.
He insisted it is time BiH politicians grasp the importance of police reforms, the key condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
"BiH cannot associate with the EU through the Bonn powers," Lajcak told journalists Saturday (April 5th) during a visit to the 11th International Economy Fair in Mostar.
Without the backing necessary for any of three drafts presented by members of the ruling coalition, parliament decided last week to delay the vote on key police reform bills, to allow more time for consultations and compromise.

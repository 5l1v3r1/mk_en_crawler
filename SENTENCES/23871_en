ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government's anti-crisis measures are not sufficient to address the challenges of the global economic crisis, President Stipe Mesic told Zagreb-based business daily Poslovni Dnevnik on Monday (May 18th). 
He noted that most of the moves seem to be prolonged, delaying implementation until after the local elections. 
Mesic said the cabinet would likely have to approve new anti-recession measures, particularly ones that boost employment and productivity.

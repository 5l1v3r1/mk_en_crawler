BELGRADE, Serbia -- Newly-elected Parliament Speaker and acting leader of the Serb Radical Party Tomislav Nikolic announced unexpectedly on Wednesday (May 9th) that the introduction of a state of emergency could delay new elections in Serbia. 
In a statement for the media, he explained that the situation concerning Kosovo's final status could justify the move, noting that President Boris Tadic would not be able to dissolve the current legislature and call new parliamentary elections, even if a new cabinet is not formed by the May 14th deadline. 
The head of the government's press office says the cabinet would not even consider the idea.

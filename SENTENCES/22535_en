PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Members of parliament adopted a constitution Wednesday (April 9th) that defines Kosovo as a parliamentary republic in which Albanian and Serbian are the two official languages. 
All 103 lawmakers present supported the constitution, which consists of 40 chapters and 160 articles. 
The constitution will take effect on June 15th, when the UN is to hand over powers to the government. 
Serbia has rejected both the February 17th declaration of independence and the EU's decision to send a supervisory mission to Kosovo, insisting neither received UN Security Council approval.
Belgrade raised the ante Wednesday when Serbia's Central Election Commission decided that local elections scheduled for May 11th should extend to Kosovo as well. 
The UN mission objects to that notion and says any results would be considered invalid.

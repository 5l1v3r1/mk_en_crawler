ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday (19 July) insisted on the removal of international sanctions imposed on the Turkish-run part of Cyprus before Turkey opens its ports and harbours to Greek Cypriot traffic. 
During an official visit to northern Cyprus, Erdogan repeated support for the UN-backed efforts for a permanent solution.
Also Wednesday, a police helicopter came down in a downtown area of Turkey's Antalya resort, killing all five people aboard, but causing no casualties on the ground. 
The authorities say the accident was due to a technical failure.

PORTO CARRAS, Greece -- EU leaders meeting in Greece on Friday (20 June) said that their "objective is to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members in 2007". 
To the delight of officials from both countries, the Union pledged to work for the completion of accession negotiations in 2004.
The European leaders also welcomed Turkey's readiness to pursue reforms, but warned that "significant further efforts to this end are still required". 
The leaders praised parliament's decision on Thursday to adopt new legislation that would grant more rights to minorities. 
Ankara hopes that an EU summit at the end of 2004 would decide on the opening of accession talks with Turkey.
On Saturday, meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the birthplace of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern secular Turkish republic. 
It was viewed as a signal for reconciliation with the army, amid suggestions that Erdogan's party is pursuing a hidden religious agenda.

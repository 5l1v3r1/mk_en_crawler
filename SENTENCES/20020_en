BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) announced on Tuesday (March 18th) it is unhappy with amendments to two measures aimed at tracking the assets of lawmakers and other senior public servants. 
The Chamber of Deputies endorsed the changes last week, in a bid to make financial holdings more transparent and reduce corruption. 
The PDL says the changes only make the procedure as complicated as possible. 
It is taking its case to the Constitutional Court. 
Nearly ten days ago, the court ruled that prosecutors need parliamentary approval to launch corruption investigations against former and current ministers who are members of parliament.

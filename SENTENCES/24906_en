ANKARA, Turkey -- Police are investigating the killings of three former Chechen commanders in Istanbul in the last six months, media reported on Sunday (March 1st).
Istanbul police have set up a special unit and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) is also involved, according to media reports.
The decision followed Friday's shooting of Chechen commander Ali Osaev outside his house in Istanbul.
A gunman or gunmen shot dead Chechen colonel Gazi Edilsultanov in the Basaksehir district in September and commander Islam Canibekov in the Umraniye district in December.
The MIT is reportedly investigating possible Russian involvement in the killings.

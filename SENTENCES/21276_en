ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan says Turkey will try to establish closer co-operation with Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq to prevent members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) from finding refuge there.
"We've had some differences about the terrorist organisation PKK.
But in coming days we can expect intensive contacts on different levels with the administration in northern Iraq," Babacan said at a press conference Monday (April 28th) after meeting with New Zealander Foreign Minister Winston Peters in Ankara.
Babacan said that he hopes Turkey and the administration in northern Iraq can boost economic co-operation, especially in the energy sector.

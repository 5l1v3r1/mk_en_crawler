ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul warned a campaign to apologise for the killing of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917 could harm diplomatic efforts to normalise relations between Turkey and Armenia, media reported on Friday (January 2nd).
"I do not think the latest debates ...
make a positive contribution," Gul said in a TV interview late Thursday, warning of "polarisation".
The campaign launched in December by a group of Turkish intellectuals and academics has sparked a fierce public backlash.
Turkey and Armenia have never had diplomatic relations since Armenia became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991.

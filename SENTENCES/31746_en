ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey plans to modify its policy towards Cyprus in line with the UN-sponsored peace plan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yusuf Buluc said Wednesday (8 January).
He added that the ultimate goal of the new Turkish policy will be to reach a compromise that would benefit all parties involved, including Greek Cypriots.
The same day, <I>Radikal</I> quoted Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis as saying that the final touches to the strategy were being added and that it would be presented to the public within "a few weeks".
Turkey fears that once the Greek part of Cyprus enters the EU, the 30,000 Turkish troops currently stationed in the northern part of the island might be viewed as aggressors.
For his part, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis urged Ankara to resolve the issue by the 28 February deadline set by the UN.

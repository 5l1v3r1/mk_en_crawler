TIRANA, Albania -- An ad hoc parliamentary commission that has been investigating alleged violations by Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku officially recommended his dismissal Tuesday (4 July).
The panel's report concluded that Sollaku had violated the law by deliberately closing proceedings against some suspects and by concealing assets.
Parliament will discuss the findings next week.

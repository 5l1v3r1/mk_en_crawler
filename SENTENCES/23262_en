SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The newly-formed Blue Coalition, which unites the largest right-wing parties, was not allowed to register Thursday (May 28th) for parliamentary elections. 
It may be due to an ongoing lawsuit involving leaders of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF). 
The Sofia city court hasn't registered the party's new leader, Martin Dimitrov, due to appeals from the former chairman, Plamen Yurukov. 
He actually tried to register the UDF separately for the European Parliament elections, but the Supreme Administrative Court intervened, ruling Yurukov is unable to represent the UDF, as his authority ended once party elections began. 
Representatives of the Blue Coalition say they will appeal Thursday's electoral bureau decision.

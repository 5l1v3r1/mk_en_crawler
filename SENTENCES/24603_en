ANKARA, Turkey -- Victories by centre-right parties at this weekend's European Parliament (EP) elections in EU member states has caused concern in Turkey regarding its EU integration process, Murat Mercan, chairman of parliament's Foreign Relations Committee, said on Monday (June 8th).
He expressed doubt about chances of advancing Turkey's accession negotiations during the next EP term.
"Europe's trend toward the extreme right is worrying," Mercan said.
Some far-right candidates who oppose Turkey's EU bid managed to gain popular support by using xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric, he said.
Speaking at a press conference late Monday, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was more upbeat about Turkey's accession prospects, saying relations between Turkey and the EU will not be affected by personnel changes in the EP.
"Whoever we negotiate with, our determination [to gain EU membership] will not change," he stressed.
In Brussels, European Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger downplayed concerns over any effect on EU enlargement.
"The Council of Europe has given us a mandate to negotiate with Turkey and this mandate does not alter," he said.

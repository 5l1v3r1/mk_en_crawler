Serbia kicked off the new year in a spirit of hope.
Positive signals have been coming from Brussels, and the government has declared its intention to speed up the EU integration process in 2009.
Only a few days into January, however, a labour crisis erupted, demonstrating that the path forward still includes many obstacles.
In addition to the well-known ones, such as the need to arrest former Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladic, the authorities may be facing some they did not expect.
Angry over a broken pledge to raise salaries, the major Serbian unions have threatened to go on strike.
The government, backed by representatives of the business sector, says the raises are no longer possible due to the global economic crisis, the effects of which have had a big impact on the Serbian economy.
In such conditions, the authorities say, fatter paychecks for some would mean layoffs for others.
The unions, however, say that the contract which promised the raises was signed in early November, when the scope of the global crisis was already known, and will not accept the government's explanation.
The salary issue aside, the global economic crisis has already served as a rationale for dismissing several thousand workers in the last days of 2008.
Some fear that Italy's Fiat, which has plans to invest 700m euros in the Serbian car industry, could drop the deal due to events on the global markets.
If those fears come true, Serbia will be left without an investment that could revitalise its economy.
Serbia will also have to face a production decline and a decrease in the GDP growth rate, which, instead of the projected 6%, is now estimated at a modest 2.5% for the new year.
Political conflict
On the political scene, the two biggest partners in the ruling coalition -- the Democratic Party and G17 Plus -- clashed late last year over the sale of the Serbian oil company NIS to Russia's Gazprom.
Most analysts see the sale as escalating inter-party tensions that already existed.
The conflict went so far that the public speculated the possibility of an early election or cabinet reshuffle.
However, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, a Democratic Party official, said a cabinet shakeup was not being considered at the moment.
An early election during the economic crisis would be the worst solution, he insisted.
Serbia "must enter calmer political waters, with compromise and stability as the key words, rather than conflicts, divisions, campaign, and elections," Cvetkovic said.
EU hopes
Political stability would be greatly enhanced if the government achieves major successes this year with its European agenda.
A major hurdle remains, however, and that is the failure so far to arrest Mladic and fellow war crimes indictee Goran Hadzic.
Although 26 EU members are in favor of continuing Serbia's European integration, the Netherlands says it will keep blocking the process until Mladic is delivered to the tribunal.
Rasim Ljajic, who heads the country's national council for co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), concedes that the arrests must take place this year, or progress will come to a halt.
The government claims that the search for Mladic has been more intense than ever, and that it is co-operating with foreign intelligence services to locate him.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who was in Brussels last week to discuss Serbia's EU application, asked the EU to send an observer mission to assess the state of co-operation with the ICTY.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn agreed with the proposal and said he will send a mission and will travel to Belgrade himself on February 12th.
Jeremic said that Serbia plans to submit its membership application to the Union by June.
He said he has spoken with the ministers of leading EU members and they assured him they were ready to help Serbia "achieve the priority goal Â– become an EU membership candidate by the end of 2009".
The Mladic case is not the only potential holdup.
Cvetkovic has warned that the EU is preoccupied with its own internal issues -- specifically, the economic crisis and the difficulties in adopting the Lisbon agreement.
As a result, the climate for enlargement may not be ideal.
No thaw over Kosovo
Nearly a year after the southern Serbian province of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence, the situation remains unresolved.
Belgrade has shown no indication that it is ready to write off Kosovo as a lost battle.
On the contrary, it is ramping up efforts to block independence in the legal and diplomatic arenas.
The International Court of Justice has been asked to make an assessment, and Serbian representatives will have an opportunity to present their side of the story.
Serbia is also making efforts to stall international recognition of the fledgling state.
So far, 53 states have extended recognition, including some of the world's strongest economies.
Belgrade is intent on ensuring the number does not grow substantially during 2009.
"I expect immense pressure on around 50 states around the world to recognise Kosovo and Metohija and thus practically ignore the court process.
We will try to avert, reduce and stop that pressure," Jeremic said.
As firm as such words are, there are limits to what Serbia can actually do to influence the situation.
Indeed, this is a potential problem affecting much of the government's agenda:
progress in many areas depends on variables which may be beyond the country's control.
As a result, the outlook for 2009 remains uncertain, with the potential existing both for celebration and disappointment.
The leadership appears committed to putting in the maximum effort needed to avoid a year of failed hopes.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The European Commission (EC) will release the third 1.15 billion-euro tranche of the 20 billion-euro loan to Romania, as all criteria and conditions in the agreement have been accomplished, EC official Laurent Moulin said on Wednesday (August 4th). 
Moulin also said that GDP contraction this year will reach 1.9% due to weak demand and the recent floods, but next year he estimates a 1.5% growth or more. 
Meanwhile, IMF mission chief Jeffrey Franks said that the end-of-June economic performance was satisfactory and the measures taken were adequate for reaching the targets. 
However, Franks emphasised that the implemented measures have to be maintained.

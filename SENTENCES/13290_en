PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two Serbs were killed and two were injured in a drive-by shooting in Kosovo late on Saturday (27 August). 
Four men were travelling in a car near the Serb enclave of Strpce when shots were fired at them from a passing car. 
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said he was "shocked and appalled by this senseless and tragic crime". 
He urged anyone with information about the case to go to the police. 
This was the first incident since June 2004, when a Serb teenager was killed in Gracanica. 
Two ethnic Albanians have been charged with his murder.

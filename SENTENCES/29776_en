SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH turned down on Wednesday (January 26th) Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda's appeal against the extension of his detention. 
Dismissing the appeal as groundless, the court upheld an earlier decision to extend Purda's custody pending extradition to Serbia. 
Purda, who fought in the eastern town of Vukovar, was detained earlier this month at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. 
Authorities in Belgrade suspect him of involvement in war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar early in the 1992-1995 conflict.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Military Medical Academy has printed leaflets informing the public about steps to take during a terrorist attack, the daily 24 Chasa reported Wednesday (28 July).
A total of 100,000 leaflets reportedly will be distributed, containing instructions on what to do in the event of a chemical, biological or radiological attack.
The leaflets also include a basic first aid guide.
The project, which aims to boost public preparedness, is based on a similar campaign in Britain and was completed with the help of British experts.

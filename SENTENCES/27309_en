TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Ilir Meta said Sunday (January 31st) that defining maritime borders with Greece is a priority for Albania. 
Last week, the Constitutional Court in Tirana decided that an agreement on the border delineation violates the constitution and must be renegotiated. 
The opposition Socialist Party (SP) asked the court to for the review. 
Meta noted Greece's support for Albania's EU integration process.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Gay Pride parade scheduled to take place in Belgrade on Sunday (September 20th) has been cancelled due to the threat of violence, organisers announced on Saturday.
The decision came after the Interior Ministry said it could not guarantee that the march would proceed incident-free.
The parade's organisational committee met with Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic earlier on Saturday and rejected his suggestion that the event be moved from the centre of Belgrade to Usce Park.
They said Serbia had "capitulated in the face of violence".
Several radical groups, including football fans, had vowed to disrupt the event.
Sunday's parade would have been the first since 2001, when marchers were beaten by ultranationalists, football fans and skinheads.

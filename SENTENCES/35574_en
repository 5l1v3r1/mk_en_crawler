SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Semsudin Mehmedovic, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Party of Democratic Action, said Friday (9 April) that BiH should no longer endure the fallout from Republica Srpska's unwillingness to co-operate with The Hague tribunal. 
Mehmedovic noted that, since 1995, RS has not launched a single court procedure related to crimes committed against the non-Serb population during the war, nor arrested any of the 25 people indicted by the tribunal.
Also Friday, two Bosnian Serbs were killed and another man seriously injured when a gunman opened fire at them in a village near Sarajevo. 
The three men were walking on a road in Trnovo when a vehicle pulled up and someone inside opened fire.
In other news, the Federation of BiH's Commission on Missing Persons announced on Saturday that it plans to focus on Brcko this year, given information about the existence of mass graves there. 
An official says several hundred Bosniaks and a smaller number of Croats went missing in the area from 1992 to 1993.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said Thursday (May 7th) that it is everyone's right to return to their homes.
His comment came during a meeting with Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi, in which they discussed the political and security situation in the divided city.
Serbs have been protesting this month over efforts by Albanians to rebuild homes in the Serb-dominated part of town.
As the officials met, a few dozen Serbs staged another rally in the Brdjani neighbourhood.
Kosovo police and EULEX personnel had to use tear gas again to disperse the crowd.
In other news Thursday, NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels next month will discuss the possibility of reducing the number of KFOR troops in Kosovo.
The announcement came from the chairman of NATO's Military Committee, Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola.
Italian media reports suggest the number may plummet from 15,000 to 10,000.

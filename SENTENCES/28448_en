ATHENS, Greece -- Former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis announced on her webpage Monday (July 12th) that she is establishing a new political movement, Forum for Greece. 
In a video address, Bakoyannis urged all citizens, regardless of their political affiliations, to join the forum. 
She explained that it is not a political party, but would give all politicians, institutions, social partners, parties and NGOs a forum to express their positions. 
At the same time, Bakoyannis criticised both the government and the opposition for some of their failures and criticised herself, admitting "it was my mistake, I did not speak on time about things I believed were wrong." She is currently an independent in parliament.

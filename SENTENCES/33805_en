ATHENS, Greece -- An estimated 50 anarchists took over the old Athens University building and staged a sit-in Thursday (20 November), demanding the release of seven anti-globalisation activists, arrested during the EU summit in Thessaloniki in June.
The protesters stuck posters on the walls and replaced the Greek flag with a black one.
Five of the detainees -- who come from Great Britain, Spain, Syria and Greece -- have been on a hunger strike for up to two months.
Doctors say four of the men are now in critical condition.
The anarchists have already organised a series of attacks on various public institutions to draw attention to their case.
By law, the police cannot enter university buildings unless officially invited.

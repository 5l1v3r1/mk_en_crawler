BELGRADE, Serbia -- Negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) will resume when Serbia starts to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (November 30th). 
In an interview with Vecernje Novosti newspaper, he said the EU's policy towards Serbia is unchanged, despite NATO's decision to invite Serbia to join the Partnership for Peace programme. 
The EU suspended SAA negotiations with Serbia in May.

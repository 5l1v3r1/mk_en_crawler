SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two Bosniak formations -- the Party of Democratic Action (DSA) and the Party for BiH (SBiH) -- struck a coalition deal Wednesday (December 27th), thus overcoming a key hurdle in forming the governments at both the Federation of BiH entity level and, potentially, the state level.
The coalition agreement was signed during a meeting hosted by US Ambassador to Sarajevo Douglas McElhaney.
On Thursday, he was due to host a meeting between the leaders of the two main Croat parties in BiH -- the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of BiH and HDZ BiH -- as part of the effort to mediate a broad political agreement on new majorities in parliament.

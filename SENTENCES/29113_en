BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than 70 NGOs issued a statement Monday (September 6th) calling for the removal of new Agriculture Minister Valeriu Tabara over his links to the genetically modified crop industry. 
"Will Mr. 
Tabara be capable of representing the interests of Romanian farmers and consumers, given his contractual connections to Monsanto -- the largest GMO producer in the world," asked the organisations. 
Tabara, who took over the agriculture ministry in a reshuffle last Friday, explained in an interview with the daily Evenimentul Zilei that he has indeed worked for Monsanto, but insisted "there is nothing illegal or secret about this." (Ziare, AFP - 06/09/10)

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria provisionally closed the energy chapter of its accession talks with the EU on Monday (18 November), following a regular meeting with the EC in Brussels.
Under the conditions of the chapter, Bulgaria agreed to close the third and fourth units of its Kozloduy nuclear power plant by the end of 2006.
In turn, the 15 EU member states agreed to send a team of experts to again assess the safety level of the two units.
Sofia has the option to re-open the chapter for further negotiations if the team's findings are positive.
Including the energy chapter, Bulgaria has closed 23 of the 30 accession chapters.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A meeting of parties in the so-called democratic bloc -- Democratic Party (DS), Serbian Democratic Party and G17 Plus -- was postponed Friday (March 16th) until Tuesday.
G17 Plus Vice President Tomica Milosavljevic says the DS requested the delay.
This was to be the first trilateral meeting aimed at hammering out an agreement on forming Serbia's new government.
It appears the three parties would require support from parties representing ethnic minorities, to ensure a majority in Parliament.
Talks have dragged on for weeks since the January 21st elections.

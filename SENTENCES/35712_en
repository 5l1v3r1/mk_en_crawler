KONYA, Turkey -- At least 13 people were killed and more than 20 were injured Monday (2 February) when a ten story apartment building collapsed in an upscale neighbourhood in Konya, 250 km south of Ankara.
Rescuers said the casualty toll could climb, as there may have been as many as 120 people in the building when it came down.
Officials blame shoddy construction work and a boiler explosion.
In other news, a special court in Istanbul has charged a man in connection with the November terrorist attacks on a synagogue, a British bank and the British General Consulate.
According to local media, the suspect, Baki Yigit, has confessed to having met Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan at one point, but says he severed ties to al-Qaeda long ago.

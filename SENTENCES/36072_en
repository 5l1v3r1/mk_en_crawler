TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) organised a demonstration against the Socialist government Saturday (20 March) in Tirana. 
Several thousand DP supporters demanded the resignation of the cabinet led by Prime Minister Fatos Nano. 
Party leader Sali Berisha criticised the Socialists' rule but also addressed the situation in Kosovo, urging ethnic Albanians there to respect each other's rights and state institutions. 
The Socialists said they think the situation in Kosovo will be normalised soon -- they called for self-restraint and co-operation with the international presence in the province.

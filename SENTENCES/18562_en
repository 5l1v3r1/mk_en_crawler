BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers have sent what foreign policy chief Javier Solana described as "a very clear message of hope" to Serbia. 
During a meeting Monday (February 12th), the ministers agreed that negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade could be resumed if Serbia demonstrates a true commitment to work with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn explained that the capture of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic remains a condition for signing the deal with Serbia, but said talks could be reopened if the Serbs demonstrate they are really looking for him. 
The ministers also urged the Serbian parties to establish rapidly a government whose top priority would be implementation of reforms and EU integration.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) struck 663 nominations from party lists ahead of the 1 October general vote, citing non-compliance with the country's election law. 
CEC Chairman Branko Petric said on Saturday (15 July) that in most cases, the reason was procedural -- candidates failed to submit a required written statement, or failed to sign the statement. 
Four candidates were removed because the CEC or the NATO-led Stabilisation Force in BiH had sanctioned them in the past.

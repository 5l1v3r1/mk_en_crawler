ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament went into recess Friday (1 July) after adopting one key bill on banking reforms -- required by the IMF -- but failing to endorse a second one on social security reforms due to quarrels between the ruling Justice and Development Party and the opposition Republican People's Party. 
The IMF has made passage of the two measures a key condition for completing the first review of the $10 billion stand-by arrangement.

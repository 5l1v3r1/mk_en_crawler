SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) â About 70 prisoners near Banja Luka staged a revolt on Saturday (March 22nd) in a protest against corruption. 
The prisoners barricaded the second floor of the prison and insisted on speaking to Bosnian Serb Justice Minister Dzerard Selman. 
They said they were not satisfied with the privileges some prisoners received and criticised corruption among prison guards and other staff. 
In early February, Amnesty International published a report that slammed violence in BiH prisons.
In other news, three people died on Saturday (March 22nd) after an old landmine from the 1992-1995 conflicts exploded in the southeast of BiH, local police announced. 
"Two police officers and one member of BiH's civil protection unit were sent to mark the location of the landmine, which was uncovered this morning. 
A bit later an explosion was heard and it became clear that they had entered the minefield," a police spokesperson said.

Top officials from Serbia and Kosovo held talks on Friday (16 September), in a meeting initiated by the UN envoy for the implementation of standards in Kosovo, Kai Eide, who is expected to give the green light to crucial talks on final status. 
Kosovo wants to become independent of Serbia, while Serbia insists it should remain a Serbian province.
The talks between the ministers of local governance of Kosovo and Serbia -- Lutfi Haziri and Zoran Loncar -- were described as businesslike and civil, focusing on some of the less-contentious issues that have prevented a lasting peace in Kosovo, such as local government reform and the return of tens of thousands of Serbs and other minorities who fled the province after the war.
The officials also discussed the return of property records, which Serb authorities took when they relinquished control of the province to NATO-led forces and the UN administration, officials said.
Eide said the meeting was a positive step and that both ministers agreed to discuss the issues together. 
"We cannot expect from this meeting to reach an agreement on difficult issues. 
If this was possible, the whole process would have been shorter. 
But I think that it is important that all the elements are put on the table and the talks were open and frank," he told journalists.
Analysts say that Kosovo -- which has been under UN administration since 1999 -- is making an effort to display willingness to co-operate in order to show that it is ready for the UN-backed status talks.
Neighbouring Albania has been closely following the developments in Kosovo over the last years and supports its independence.
"We believe that it is the time to conclude that the independence will be the best solution. 
An independent Kosovo will offer more security and stability in the Balkan region," Albanian President Alfred Moisiu said on the province's future during the UN summit in New York.

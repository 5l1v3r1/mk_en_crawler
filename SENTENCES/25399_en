BELGRADE, Serbia -- An IMF team arrives in Belgrade on Monday (August 24th) for the first review of the 2.92 billion-euro stand-by arrangement, struck in May. 
The first meeting will be with Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic. 
For the time being, Serbia is fulfilling all parameters of the accord, except for keeping the budget deficit within 3% of GDP. 
The government has already said it would ask the IMF to agree to a higher deficit target of 4.5%. 
The cabinet also plans to propose public sector reforms, which should reduce spending long-term. 
The government will rely on that proposal to avoid any VAT or other tax rate hikes, which would undermine consumer spending, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic has said. 
The IMF team will spend 11 days in Serbia.

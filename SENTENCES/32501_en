ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Thursday (13 March), police in Vukovar arrested nine former members of a rebel Serb force on war crimes charges.
The nine are suspected of murdering and mistreating Croatian prisoners of war and civilians at a detention camp in 1991.
A court in Osijek, meanwhile, indicted two former Croatian soldiers for the December 1991 murders of 19 Serb civilians.
Prosecutors say Nikola Ivankovic and Enes Viteskic, together with some accomplices, raided the village of Paulin Dvor in retaliation for the death of a fellow soldier killed in action nearby.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The London Club of commercial creditors has decided to write off $2.8 billion of Serbia's debt and to reschedule the remaining $1.08 billion over the next 20 years, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic announced Friday (2 July).
Serbia would be paying interest of 3.75 per cent during the first five years and 6.75 per cent in the next 15 years.
Dinkic explained that the deal would bring down the republic's overall foreign debt to 60 per cent of GDP, after ratification by parliament.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Lazar Radjenovic, a member of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, was elected on Wednesday (April 27th) by the municipal assembly as the new mayor of Budva. 
He replaces Rajko Kuljaca, who resigned recently. 
Kuljaca and his deputy, Dragan Marovic, were arrested in December along with several other municipal officials for suspected abuse of office, stemming from illegal construction on the Zavala peninsula. 
Prosecutors say they siphoned off more than 11m euros.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police used water cannons and tear gas Sunday (January 16th) to disperse dozens of young Kurds who hurled gas bombs and stones at them after a rally in downtown Istanbul. 
The protest brought together about 2,000 people who marched down Istiklat Avenue against the trial of about 150 people suspected of links to Kurdish rebels. 
The trial is at a local court in Diyarbakir, the main city of the Kurdish-dominated. 
On Friday, it was postponed until Tuesday to give prosecutors time to examine the demands of defence lawyers, among them, lifting a travel ban on defendants Osman Baydemir, the mayor of Diyarbakir, and Abdullah Demirbas, the mayor of the Sur municipality. 
Both defendants are on trial but not in detention.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police raided the homes Wednesday (March 30th) of several theology professors as part of an investigation into the 2007 murders of three Christian missionaries. 
Among those whose home was searched is Zekeriya Beyaz, a renowned theologian from Istanbul who has written an unpublished book about the political activities of certain religious groups in Turkey. 
Police lacked the authorisation to make any arrests this time, though five active duty Turkish officers and two civilians were arrested on March 21st as part of the same investigation.
Before that, five civilians were arrested and charged with murder stemming from the killings in the central Anatolian city of Malatya. 
Prosecutors have broadened their investigation, suspecting the murders were part of the so-called Ergenekon case, an alleged plot to topple the government by creating chaos.
In other news Wednesday, the lead prosecutor in that case, Zakeriya Oz, was removed from the case. 
Oz, who said the move was a surprise to him, will change jobs as part of a series of new appointments by the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors.

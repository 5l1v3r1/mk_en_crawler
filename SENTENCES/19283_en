ANKARA, Turkey -- Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler announced on Sunday (January 27th) that Iran had resumed natural gas deliveries to Turkey.
Tehran sharply reduced the flow on January 1st, then stopped it entirely a week later, citing an interrupted supply from Turkmenistan.
The shortage of gas in Turkey in turn forced it to cut deliveries to Greece.
In other news Sunday, Turkish media reported that the state-owned Turkish Pipeline Company (BOTAS) has launched a feasibility study covering Turkey's segment of a planned Iraq-Turkey natural gas pipeline.
It is to be built parallel to the existing Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline.
The project aims to transfer 10 billion cubic metres of Iraqi natural gas annually to the Turkish and world markets.

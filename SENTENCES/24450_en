PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said on Friday (January 9th) the upcoming parliamentary elections will not bring any changes to the distribution of power on the political scene.
He expressed confidence people will choose the political group that "showed responsibility towards the country's future", referring to his Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is part of the present coalition government together with Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS).
"These elections are a test of confidence, and the fact that this government has endured for 20 years shows that it is serious and responsible," Vujanovic claimed to the Voice of America.
Earlier this week, local media reported without confirmation the country will hold extraordinary general elections on March 29th.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- On Monday (November 10th), EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn are expected to propose the closure of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in 2009, according to Reuters.
The two officials' joint document envisages the EU assuming the OHR's role in BiH.
"The status quo is unsustainable and will probably remain so until the international community is ready to change the parameters of its presence and its approach," the draft says.
Another issue at Monday's meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers is the fate of the EUFOR peacekeeping force in BiH, Reuters and AFP reported.
Current EU presidency holder France favours the end of the EUFOR mission, but other EU countries want the mission to stay on after OHR's shutdown in order to help maintain stability.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik responded angrily Thursday (April 16th) to media reports claiming prosecutors will soon charge him with embezzlement and abuse of power. 
"It is clear that media are creating a climate against the RS and everything that is in the RS," Dodik told journalists. 
He described the claims as "a personal attack" on him and accused prosecutors of motives other than "justice". 
Local media recently reported BiH prosecutors plan to indict Dodik in late May or early June, along with several other RS cabinet members, based on a report by the State Investigation and Protection Agency. 
It reportedly outlines large-scale embezzlement worth around 70m euros, stemming from various construction projects.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic has written to Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov regarding Cedomir Brankovic, a Serbia-Montenegro Army officer who was arrested in Sofia last week. 
Brankovic was convicted in absentia of war crimes in Croatia years ago. 
Local media reported on Sunday (1 May) that Tadic assured Parvanov that Serbia is not trying to evade responsibility for possible war crimes committed by its citizens. 
Therefore, he added, there is no reason Bulgaria should become involved in this case and affect bilateral relations. 
Arrested on a warrant issued by Interpol, Brankovic was soon released because of diplomatic immunity.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic is making a daylong visit to the Netherlands Monday. 
He and Dutch counterpart Bernard Bot are discussing the next steps Serbia-Montenegro must undertake in the Euro-Atlantic integration process.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Transport Minister Nikolay Vassilev says Bulgaria and Italy are considering ways to boost bilateral transportation. 
Speaking Sunday (27 July), he cited two possibilities: increasing the number of flights between Rome or Milan and Sofia, while nearly doubling the number of permits for Bulgarian road carriers to Italy. 
The proposed measures will be discussed Monday at a meeting of transport organisations from the two countries.

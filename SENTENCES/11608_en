TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) continues to tackle complaints and appeals over the results of the 3 July parliamentary vote, according to a statement issued Wednesday (20 July). 
The CEC says it rejected as groundless a demand filed by Socialist Party (SP) candidate Anastas Angjeli. 
The outgoing economy minister was contesting the results in Tirana's 38th constituency, where the Democratic Party's Ylli Pango defeated him. 
The CEC says it will decide by week's end on a separate appeal filed by Foreign Minister Kastriot Islami of the SP, who ran in Fier's 74th constituency. 
International monitors from the OSCE urged authorities earlier this week to speed up the process, particularly the handling of complaints.

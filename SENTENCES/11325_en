BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian government reported Monday (25 July) that recent severe storms claimed the lives of 24 people and caused 672.5m euros in damage.
More than 25,000 houses in 34 counties were partially or completely destroyed, Interior Minister Vasile Blaga said.
At least 3,000 km of roads were damaged, along with bridges, dykes, electricity and water infrastructure and more than 300,000 hectares of agricultural land.
The government will pass the figures to the EU with a request for at least 20m euros for emergency reconstruction.
The money is expected to come from the EU Solidarity Fund.
Financial and humanitarian aid is also being provided by the World Bank, the UN, the United States, Japan and South Korea.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraqi, Turkish and US officials will meet in Ankara on Tuesday (July 28th) to discuss joint measures to combat terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) members in northern Iraq, a Turkish government source said on Saturday.
"Talks will be focused on co-operation in the fight against terrorism and ways to strengthen security measures, including intelligence sharing," the official, who wished to remain anonymous, said.
The meeting will be hosted by Turkish Interior Minister Besir Atalay.
In related news, police arrested nearly 200 people suspected of belonging to Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami, a radical Islamist group.
Friday's operation was carried out simultaneously in at least 23 provinces across the country and involved security force anti-terrorist units.

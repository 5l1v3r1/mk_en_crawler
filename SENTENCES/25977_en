SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government is ready with its nomination for an EU commissioner, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov announced on Thursday (September 17th).
He refused to identify the candidate, however.
Most believe it will be current Foreign Minister Rumyana Zheleva.
Still unclear is what sector Bulgaria will be responsible for in the European Commission (EC);
talks on this continue.
On Thursday, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso was elected to a second term as president of the EC, with the support of most Bulgarian parties in the European Parliament.

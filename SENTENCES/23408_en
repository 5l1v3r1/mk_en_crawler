ROME, Italy -- Prosecutors have dropped charges against Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic over his alleged involvement in cigarette smuggling, the justice ministry announced on Wednesday (April 29th). 
Poised to assume a fifth term as prime minister, Djukanovic enjoys diplomatic immunity. 
In 2007, prosecutors in the town of Bari informed him that he might become a defendant in a lawsuit related to cigarette smuggling between 1994 and 2002. 
He has been avoiding trial because of his immunity. 
Croatian journalist Ivo Pukanic, who was killed by a car bomb in October 2008, was a key witness in the case.

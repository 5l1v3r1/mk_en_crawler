BRIJUNI, Croatia -- The justice ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro met on Wednesday (8 June) to discuss enhanced judicial co-operation in war crimes proceedings. 
The OSCE hosted the conference. 
Participants identified several measures aimed at guaranteeing the fair and impartial prosecution of war crimes cases. 
However, a text stipulating the mutual extradition of war crimes suspects is being delayed because of conflicts with the laws of some of the countries.

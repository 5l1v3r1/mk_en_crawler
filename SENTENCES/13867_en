SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown urged the BiH Council of Ministers Wednesday (18 January) to decide on the permanent location of the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA).
Ashdown, who paid a visit to SIPA's interim headquarters in Sarajevo, warned that the agency's efficiency might be jeopardised unless the issue is resolved as soon as possible.
BiH Security Minister Barisa Colak vowed that the government would tackle the problem at its next session and decide whether the permanent headquarters would be in Lukavica or Nedzarici.
In other news Wednesday, the BiH presidency adopted the country's platform for negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The presidency also approved an interim customs and trade agreement with the EU, which would take effect immediately after the SAA is sealed with the Union, likely a year from now.

TIRANA, Albania -- The interior ministry decided on Sunday (January 25th) to treat as a priority the issuing of new electronic ID cards to citizens without passports, as recommended by the main opposition Socialist Party.
Registration for the new ID cards and biometric passports began on January 12th but encountered major organisational problems.
Under the ministry's decision, those not holding a passport have until April 15th to apply for ID cards or they will face sanctions.
The procedure aims to identify all voters before the June parliamentary elections.

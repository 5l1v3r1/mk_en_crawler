PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Relatives of murder victims whose cases have gone unsolved rallied in front of Parliament in Podgorica on Tuesday (January 30th), protesting the authorities' failure to find perpetrators.
The relatives called on lawmakers to launch an open debate on organised crime and help resolve open cases.
The protests took place as the parliamentary majority rejected an opposition bid to hold an extraordinary session regarding the murder of journalist Dusko Jovanovic, killed in 2004.
Several weeks ago, the chief suspect was acquitted, despite substantial evidence suggesting his involvement in the crime.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU has halted plans for a meeting between European officials and the foreign ministers of Turkey and Cyprus.
Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said arranging the two-day meeting had proved impossible.
The EU was attempting to find a way out of an impasse over Ankara's accession talks.
Turkey has refused to open its airports and seaports to traffic from EU member Cyprus, demanding that the EU first lift restrictions on trade with the Turkish Cypriots.
The Cypriot government immediately blamed Turkey for the cancellation and pledged to continue working towards a solution.
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul in turn accused the Greek Cypriots of abusing and blocking the process.
In Athens, meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told parliament that it is unacceptable for an EU candidate to refuse to recognise an EU member state.
The European Commission issues a progress report on Turkey next week.

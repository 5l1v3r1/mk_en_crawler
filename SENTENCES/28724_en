PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Central Elections Commission (CEC) declared the Democratic League of Kosovo's (LDK) Haki Rugova winner of Sunday's (May 9th) mayoral race in Istog, western Kosovo.
Turnout was about 30%.
This was the second round of elections, with voters choosing between Rugova and Shasivar Haxhiaj of the Democratic Party.
Rugova, cousin of late President Ibrahim Rugova, won 76% of the votes, the CEC said, announcing preliminary results.
The elections were necessitated by the death of the mayor elected in November.

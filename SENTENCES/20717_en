BELGRADE, Serbia -- An international peace conference on Kosovo, like the one in Rambouillet or Dayton, could be organised in November or early December, the EU representative in the Kosovo troika, Wolfgang Ischinger, suggested on Sunday (October 7th). 
The conference likely would involve the troika and negotiating teams from Belgrade and Pristina, rather than all six countries that comprise the Contact Group. 
Ischinger stressed that the three international mediators are working on their own proposals for Kosovo's final status.
Veton Surroi, a member of Pristina's negotiating team, said Kosovo is prepared to participate in any negotiating process as long as the troika presents a proposal that leads to independence.

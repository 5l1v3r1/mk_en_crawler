BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Following a meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase in Brussels on Friday (5 November), European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen said Bucharest might complete EU accession talks by the end of November.
Verheugen added that he personally believes finalising negotiations by the end of this month -- earlier than either the EU or Romania expects -- is not only possible but also "necessary".
In other news, leaders of the Socialist International met in Bucharest on Saturday to discuss regional and political issues.
During the session, the president of the Socialist International, Antonio Guterres, expressed support for Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party, ahead of the 28 November general elections.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police on Friday (December 21st) arrested Goran Savic, 38, who is suspected of war crimes against Bosnian Muslim civilians in 1992. 
The arrest was based on a warrant issued by the war crimes prosecution in Serbia. 
The prosecution says it has proof that in May 1992 Savic tortured Muslim civilians in a factory in Zvornik, killing one person. 
An investigation is under way against Savic and war crimes suspect Sasa Djilerdzic, who was arrested earlier in connection with the same case. 
The two men will face trial before a Belgrade court.

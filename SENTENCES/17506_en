ANKARA, Turkey --The top Turkish commanders are expected to convene on Wednesday (August 1st) for the annual Supreme Military Council (YAS). 
The four-day meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Promotions and retirements of generals and colonels are expected to top the agenda.
The meeting comes on the heels of the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) victory in parliamentary elections. 
The party has vowed to replace the country's 1982 military-dictated constitution with a civilian one. 
Expected changes include making YAS decisions on promotions, retirements and expulsions subject to court rulings.

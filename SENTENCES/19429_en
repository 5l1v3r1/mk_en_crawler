SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski opened the 17th meeting of the Co-ordination Committee within the Process of Meetings of Southeast Europe Defence Ministers (SEDM) on Tuesday (September 25th).
Skopje assumed the two-year rotating presidency of the organisation late last month.
Elenovski opened Tuesday's session by saying Macedonia is dedicated to contributing to the dissemination of NATO values.
The two-day meeting brings together representatives of SEDM members -- Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United States.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia have monitor status.
In other news Tuesday, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders Hina Jilani visited Skopje, noting progress in the field of human rights protections over the past two years.
However, he also cited weaknesses, including the gap between legislation adopted and actually implemented.
A scuffle, meanwhile, marred Tuesday's session of parliament.
At least four people were injured in the brawl, which erupted during a break.
The session had been aimed at easing strained relations among ethnic Albanian parties.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Eleven people have been arrested in connection with attacks on French football fans in Belgrade earlier in the week, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Saturday (September 19th). 
Three French nationals were injured Thursday, one critically, by Serb fans in a Belgrade pub after a match between Serbia's Partizan and France's Toulouse. 
The suspected organiser of the attack was among those arrested and more arrests are expected.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided Friday (30 July) to ask parliament to postpone this year's local elections by one month.
The vote would be held on 21 November instead of 21 October.
Officials say the delay is necessary because of the prolonged parliamentary debate on the power decentralisation package.
Among other things, it envisions redrawing boundaries, reducing the number of municipalities from 123 to 80.

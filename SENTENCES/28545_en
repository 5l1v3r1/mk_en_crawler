ANKARA, Turkey -- Ankara would approve a plan for a NATO missile defence system in Europe only if it is sure there is a concrete threat against all NATO members, or at least a perceived threat, senior officials in Ankara were quoted by Zaman as saying on Thursday (October 14th). 
The comments came after US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for European and NATO Policy James Townsend told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that Turkey plays major role in the US missile defence system, given its geographic location. 
"As we look at where the ballistic-missile threats can come from, Turkey seems to us to be quite -- very much along the front line," Townsend said. 
NATO defence and foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the Alliance's new strategic concept, including the missile-defence shield issue.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged the BiH state and entity governments to reform the social security system, to ensure those in the greatest need are better targeted for benefits. 
In a statement Monday (January 28th), Lajcak said the present system is flawed and that his office as well as international financial institutions will assist with reforms. 
He was responding to a letter from the BiH Invalids' Association, asking him to transfer social and health benefit responsibilities to the state level.

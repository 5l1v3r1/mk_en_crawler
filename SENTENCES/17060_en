SOFIA, Bulgaria -- All cabinet ministers and deputy ministers are being ordered to make public their asset statements, in a bid to bring more transparency to the government's work. 
Under a decision adopted Thursday (1 June), cabinet members will fill in new, detailed declarations about their property and assets, which will be uploaded on the Bulgarian Council of Ministers' Web site next week. 
Currently, those declarations are available at the Chief Auditing Office, but they are not free to the public. 
President Georgi Parvanov recently revealed his holdings and urged other politicians to follow his example.

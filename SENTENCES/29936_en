PODGORICA, Montenegro -- A court in Podgorica on Saturday (January 22nd) extended the custody of suspects by two months in the so-called Zavala case. 
Judges decided that if released, the detained Budva municipal officials and their alleged collaborators might influence witnesses. 
Budva Mayor Rajko Kuljaca, his deputy, Dragan Marovic, and several other people were arrested in December for suspected abuse of office, stemming from illegal construction on a cape near the coastal town.

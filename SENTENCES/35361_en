BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government officially denied on Tuesday (15 June) that Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is resigning. 
The statement was in response to comments in the press that talks are under way for his resignation. 
But analysts note that the denial does not rule out the possibility of preliminary elections being held in mid-September.

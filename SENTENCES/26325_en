BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Alin Serbanescu denied on Thursday (August 13th) a media report suggesting that on one of Bucharest's busiest streets was a secret CIA prison. 
According to Thursday's New York Times, the facility was based in a newly renovated building, which could house up to six terrorism suspects. 
The newspaper quoted former CIA officials who said this happened back in 2003. 
Serbanescu said on Thursday that a special investigative committee established by parliament found no evidence of the allegation.

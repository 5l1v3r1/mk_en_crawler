GRAZ, Austria -- Police in Austria have arrested a man suspected of being a senior member of a crime syndicate in Turkey.
Alaatin Cakici, 51, is alleged to have been involved in a bank scandal that brought down the government of Mesut Yilmaz in 1998.
His arrest comes days after parliament members voted to prosecute Yilmaz and another minister over the scandal.
Cakici, who is also wanted on extortion charges, fled Turkey in May after being released from jail.
Austria's Federal Criminal Investigation Office said Cakaci was arrested in the southern city of Graz on an Interpol warrant.
They said he had been under surveillance since checking into a Viennese hotel under an assumed name.
He is said to have also hidden in Greece, Italy and France.

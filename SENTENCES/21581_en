PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Opposition parties on Thursday (November 27th) criticised Kosovo's leaders for failing on the diplomatic front. 
The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) and the Democratic League of Dardania were responding to the UN Security Council, which decided on Wednesday to give a green light to EULEX's deployment under the UN umbrella. 
"This is a confirmation of the political loss for Kosovo ... 
This shows we have leadership lacking vision," AAK leader Ramush Haradinaj said.
Meanwhile, EULEX Commander Yves de Kermabon said on Thursday that a group of 2,000 EU and US police, customs agents and judicial officials will be deployed in Kosovo next week. 
"I expect as of the beginning of December to start the EULEX mission Kosovo-wide," de Kermabon said.

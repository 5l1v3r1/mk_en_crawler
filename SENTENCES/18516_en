SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The cabinet nominated Ljupco Svrgovski as new chief prosecutor Thursday (January 11th). 
He is currently deputy prosecutor. 
The resolution was forwarded to Parliament for approval, which should vote on it by the end of the month. 
The country has been without a public prosecutor since October, when parliament dismissed Aleksandar Prcevski due to inefficiency and unprofessional behaviour.

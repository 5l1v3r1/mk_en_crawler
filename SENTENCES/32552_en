ATHENS, Greece -- On Thursday (6 March), the foreign ministry ruled out the possibility of a double name for Macedonia. 
At issue is a long-standing impasse between Athens and Skopje over the name of the former Yugoslav republic. 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Panos Beglitis said "Greece wants the adoption of one and only one name by the neighbouring state for all purposes." He added that Greece is willing to continue negotiations within the framework of the UN until an acceptable solution is reached.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Visiting the Serbian capital on Wednesday (March 28th), Republika Srpska (RS) President Milan Jelic said that Banja Luka would not recognise Kosovo, should the UN Security Council approve envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence.
Speaking to reporters at a Belgrade economic fair, he said that Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole would thus be unlikely to extend recognition.
Jelic also echoed Belgrade's call for continued negotiations.
The same day, the Slovak Parliament adopted a resolution calling for more dialogue on Kosovo.
It cautioned that unrestricted independence might affect regional stability.

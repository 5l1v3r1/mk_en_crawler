BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Dejan "Bugsy" Milenkovic, one of the key suspects in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, denied the charges against him as the trial resumed at the Belgrade Organised Crime Court on Wednesday (9 March). 
Arrested in Greece in July 2004, Milenkovic's appearance before the judges was delayed because of a lengthy extradition process. 
In addition to the Djindjic assassination, Milenkovic is charged in connection with six other murders and three abductions under a collective indictment against the Zemun Clan criminal gang.

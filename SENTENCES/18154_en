ATHENS, Greece -- Clashes again erupted again on Thursday (January 18th) between students and police in Athens, during a third day of protests against the government's educational reforms.
A small group of youths threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at a bank branch and the offices of Greece's Competition Commission before retreating to the grounds of the Athens University of Economics.
It was near there on Wednesday that thousands of students and university lecturers rallied to protest planned changes in the Constitution that would allow the establishment of private universities.

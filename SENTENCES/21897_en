STARA PAZOVA, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic says Serbia needs a socially responsible government, founded on the principle of national reconciliation.
Tadic, who also leads the Democratic Party (DS), said on Monday (May 19th) that political forces of the 1990s and those that were in power after 2000 "should unite over common goals in order to calm the population, tensions and misunderstandings".
He also called for an end to harsh rhetoric.
Tadic and the DS-led coalition plans to hold formal negotiations with the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS), following the inconclusive parliamentary elections that took place on May 11th.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) hopes to form a ruling coalition as well, involving the SPS and the Serbian Radical Party.

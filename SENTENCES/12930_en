TIRANA, Albania -- A new poll conducted by Gallup International suggests that none of the political parties will win a parliamentary majority in the 3 July elections. 
According to the results, presented in Tirana on Wednesday (1 June), the two main parties -- the ruling Socialist Party and the Democratic Party -- are each likely to receive some 34 per cent of the vote. 
The Socialist Movement for Integration is expected to get around 10 per cent.
The elections were the focus of talks Wednesday between Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano and a delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. 
Nano reiterated that authorities are making every effort to ensure a democratic and fair vote, in line with European standards.

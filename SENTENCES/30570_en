PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Northern Kosovo does not represent a risk for Kosovo; therefore, an interim solution should be sought until a final solution is reached, Marko Prelec, International Crisis Group's Balkans Project Director told Voice of America on Monday (March 14th). 
He was discussing the ICG's new report titled "North Kosovo-Dual Sovereignty in Practice". 
It concludes that the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue mediated by the EU is likely to look at regional co-operation, communications, freedom of movement, and the rule of law over the coming months. 
According to Prelec, the ultimate aim of the dialogue is to reach the point where Pristina and Belgrade can solve all open issues, a process that will take years, he predicted.

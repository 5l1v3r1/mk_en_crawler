SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said on Saturday (16 August) that there was no serious threat to national security connected with recent events in Kosovo.
However, he also said that Macedonian authorities should pay close attention to the situation.
According to Buckovski, the main concern now is not the status of Kosovo but its stability, which he said affects the stability and security of the whole region.
On a different subject, he said the Macedonian Army had achieved high standards of combat readiness, adding that the country had the right to expect an eventual invitation for NATO membership.

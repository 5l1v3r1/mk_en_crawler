ZAGREB, Croatia/LONDON, United Kingdom -- Calling it a case of mistaken identity, Croatia has withdrawn its extradition request for a Croatian Serb arrested in late March by British police for alleged war crimes, according to reports on Tuesday (April 6th).
A Croatian court has ruled that Mile Bosnic, detained on March 25th in Gloucester is not the wanted war criminal.
Another man named Bosnic is wanted for war crimes committed against Croat civilians early in the 1991-1995 conflict.

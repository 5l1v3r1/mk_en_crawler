BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou asked the European Commission (EC) on Monday (17 November) to be tougher in its negotiations with Albania on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). 
In a speech to a EU Council of Ministers' meeting focusing on the western Balkans, Papandreou voiced serious concerns over irregularities reported in areas populated by the Greek minority during last month's local elections in Albania. 
He urged all incidents involving minority rights be taken into consideration when assessing Albania's behaviour in light of the SAA.

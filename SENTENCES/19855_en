BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Tuesday (October 23rd) he has signed a decree calling for a referendum on the majority voting system, the same day as the European Parliament elections.
The date is November 25th.
But the government announced on Tuesday it would ask for a vote of confidence regarding the majority voting system bill, in an effort to block Basescu from organising the referendum.
He and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu have quarrelled publicly over the need for the new election system, which Basescu says will make politicians more accountable to voters.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney says he believes the next round of talks on BiH constitutional changes -- scheduled for next week in Washington -- can result in a significant step forward. 
In an interview published in Wednesday's (16 November) Nezavisne novine, McElhaney said that next round would focus both on the achievements of the Dayton Peace Accords and BiH in the past ten years, as well as on what must be done from now on. 
He added that Washington is dedicated to the restructuring of the BiH presidency, Council of Ministers and the state parliament.
Separately Tuesday, Milorad Dodik, leader of the main Bosnian Serb opposition party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats, said that in Washington, BiH leaders would issue a joint call for war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic to surrender.

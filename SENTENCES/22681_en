TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi called on the High Inspectorate for the Declaration and Audit of Assets (HIDAA) on Thursday (July 10th) to verify all assets government officials hold in banks outside the country.
"The time has come for a new period, that of a clear distancing of the state from every corrupt official and officials with illegal assets," Topi said at a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of HIDAA.
He also criticised 175 state officials who have refused to declare their assets.
In other news, Health Minister Nard Ndoka warned on Thursday that medical workers involved in corruption would face prosecution.
His statement followed a series of corruption cases reported by the media.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The number of Serbian asylum seekers in the EU fell by 35% since the end of December, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Monday (May 23rd) after meeting with a Belgian delegation. 
The favourable trend is likely to persist, Dacic added, announcing tougher measures to resolve the problem.
Belgian State Secretary for Migration and Asylum Policy Melchior Wathelet hailed Serbia's efforts but warned that the number of asylum seekers remains considerable. 
Head of the EU delegation to Serbia Vincent Degert says it is five-to-six times higher since the introduction of visa-free travel in late 2009, down from about ten times higher. 
He urged authorities to immediately tackle the problem to avoid the reintroduction of visas.
The European Commission is expected to draft a proposal Tuesday to introduce a safeguard clause that would allow just that: the temporary reintroduction of visas for third countries under certain circumstances, media reported on Monday. 
The proposal will then be discussed by the EU interior ministers when they meet next month. 
The mechanism is reportedly in response to the influx of asylum seekers from Macedonia and Serbia.

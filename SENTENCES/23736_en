TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Tuesday (April 21st) rejected speculation about a possible postponement of the June 28th parliamentary elections due to difficulties in issuing new ID cards.
He also urged all political parties to stop arguing over the success of the process.
"These debates are harming the process and are a wrong step for Albanian politics," Topi said.
In other news Tuesday, a court in Vlora sentenced ethnic Greek Vasil Bollano, mayor of the southern town of Himara, to six months in prison for abuse of power.
He faced charges of ordering the removal of road signs in Himara in December 2007, when he had argued the signs should have Greek words as well.
Prosecutors say Bollano's move resulted in damage of nearly 170,000 euros.
The mayor must pay a fine of 3,800 euros and cannot hold public office for three years.
Parties representing the Greek minority in Albania criticised the verdict as "politically motivated and xenophobic".

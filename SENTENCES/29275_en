BUCHAREST, Romania -- Washington and Bucharest signed an agreement Monday (May 3rd) that will eventually lead to visa-free travel for Romanian citizens visiting the United States. 
Under the deal, signed by George Maior of the Romanian Intelligence Services and Richard Stein of the Federal Air Marshals, the two countries commit to providing air marshals on commercial flights to each other's territories, to boost aviation security. 
The agreement is one of several requirements to include Romania in the so-called Visa Waiver Programme, which allows members to spend up to 90 days in the United States without visas.

ATHENS, Greece -- Police announced on Tuesday (November 2nd) a 48-hour suspension of international airmail after several parcel bombs were found in embassies and international organisations in Athens. 
The suspension is necessary to conduct checks, authorities explained. 
Late Tuesday, a private courier plane carrying a suspicious package from Athens was rerouted to the Bologna airport in Italy, where during examination, the package caught fire. 
No injuries were reported.
Earlier in the day, two parcel bombs addressed to Europol in the Netherlands and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg were destroyed in controlled explosions. 
Parcel bombs exploded in the Swiss and Russian embassies in Athens and several other suspicious packages were destroyed at the Bulgarian and Chilean embassies. 
Nobody was hurt. 
In Berlin, meanwhile, authorities said a parcel bomb addressed to Chancellor Angela Merkel's office came from Greece. 
Police suspect the extreme-left group conspiracy Nuclei of Fire is behind the attacks.

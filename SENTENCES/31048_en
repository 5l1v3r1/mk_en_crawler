BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The delegations from Pristina and Belgrade will meet in Brussels on Tuesday (March 8th) to open two-day talks on "practical issues", without the consent of the Kosovo parliament. 
Lawmakers in Pristina failed on Monday to adopt any of the resolutions presented, one by the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo supporting the talks and another one from the Vetevendosje movement opposing them. 
Parliament is to meet on Thursday to set the framework for the long anticipated talks. 
Despite this, officials in Brussels told Kosovo media that the EU-brokered talks will begin on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday as scheduled. 
An unnamed EU official told the Koha Ditore daily that discussions will focus on regional co-operation, freedom of movement and issues related to the rule of law. 
The same source said these practical issues are aimed at improving the lives of people in the region and co-operation in the Western Balkans.
Kosovo Local Government Minister Slobodan Petrovic stressed that Kosovo Serbs are part of Kosovo institutions and accordingly will be part of the Kosovo delegation in talks with Serbia.

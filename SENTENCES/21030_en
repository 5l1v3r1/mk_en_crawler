SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission initialled a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH on Tuesday (December 4th), in light of a decision by the country's politicians to pursue reforms suggested by the EU. 
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated in Sarajevo on Monday that initialing is different from signing -- the latter will only happen when BiH implements the required reforms, particularly by merging the police forces of the two entities. 
Bosnian Serbs have blocked police restructuring for years.
In other news, the BiH appeals court on Monday upheld the 30-year prison sentence given to former Bosniak paramilitary member Niset Ramic for war crimes against Serbs during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Ramic was convicted of murdering four Serb civilians and injuring two others in a village near Visoko in June 1992 while he was a member of the Visoko Territorial Defence Force. 
He was arrested in October 2006 and was sentenced this past July. 
Thirty years is the longest sentence imposed so far by BiH's War Crimes Chamber.

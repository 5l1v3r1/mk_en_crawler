SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) still has no nominee for deputy parliament speaker, says Parliamentary Chairman Nikola Popovski. 
That contradicts media reports that DUI has selected Hisni Shakiri, a former parliamentarian who left his post to join the National Liberation Army. 
Popovski said he would not approve the nomination. 
On a related note, Dnevnik reports that DUI chairman Ali Ahmeti will attend Tuesday's parliamentary session. 
It would be his first such appearance since his party won the majority of Albanian votes in September's parliamentary elections.

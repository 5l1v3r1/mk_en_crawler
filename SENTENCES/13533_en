SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police have arrested a Serb man suspected of taking part in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre, authorities reported Wednesday (24 August). 
Branislav Medan was a member of a Bosnian Serb special police unit that executed a large number of Muslim prisoners at a farm in Kravica two days after the enclave was overrun by Serb forces. 
Federation of BiH (FBiH) police reportedly apprehended Medan at his home in Mostar in a sweep organised with RS authorities.
In other news Wednesday, EUFOR announced that its troops found 237 anti-tank rockets hidden in the FBiH municipality of Ljubuski earlier this week. 
The rockets will be destroyed next week.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political leaders, together with members of the Kosovo Constitution Commission, signed a draft constitution Monday (April 7th) that President Fatmir Sejdiu described as "another step towards establishing the basis of a functional independent, sovereign and stable state".
EU Special Representative to Kosovo Pieter Feith, whose approval was also necessary, said the draft contained all the provisions for the "consolidation of Kosovo as a modern, multi-ethnic state".
In part, the document is modelled after the US Constitution.
The preamble has a special article guaranteeing the rights of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities.
The draft was forwarded to parliament for formal approval, with debate expected to begin on Wednesday.
The new constitution is expected to take effect on June 15th, nearly four months to the day since independence was declared.

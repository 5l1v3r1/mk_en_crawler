BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) cabinet decided on Wednesday (March 28th) to give special social-economic status to the Srebrenica Municipality, in response to demands for status outside RS's jurisdiction.
RS Minister of Administration and Local Self-Government Zoran Lipovac says the cabinet's decision obliges all relevant institutions and state-run companies to draw up economic development projects and ensure the equal employment of all constituent peoples' members in Srebrenica.
It also requires the RS Privatisation Commission to conduct an immediate review of all privatisation deals conducted there.
Bosniak municipal councillors in Srebrenica began seeking special district status after the International Court of Justice acknowledged that genocide was committed there in 1995.

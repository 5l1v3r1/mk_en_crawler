MOSCOW, Russia -- Seven sailors died on Thursday (January 3rd) after a Bulgarian cargo ship with 11 people on board sank in a storm in the Kerch strait, off the south shores of Russia in the Azov Sea. 
One crewmember has been rescued, while the other three remain missing. 
Search operations continue in treacherous weather conditions. 
The Bulgarian ship, the Vanessa, was loaded with scrap iron. 
It sank early Thursday after the storm tore away its flashboard.

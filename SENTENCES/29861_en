TIRANA, Albania -- The crisis in Libya has affected civil transportation between Albania and Italy, local media reported Sunday (February 27th).
Italian authorities have suspended ferry lines to and from Albania for the time being, in order to use the ships to evacuate its citizens from Libya.
Meanwhile, Kosovo's foreign ministry announced on Sunday that a group of 13 citizens from Albania and Kosovo has been evacuated from the troubled African country.
The group left Tripoli a day earlier for a military base in Turkey.
The Albanian Foreign Ministry is urging all its citizens still trapped in Tripoli to report to the Turkish Embassy.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- As expected, the Council of the EU on Tuesday (June 8th) extended EULEX's mandate by two years, until June 2012.
EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon and EU Special Representative Pieter Feith were in Brussels to brief the ambassadors of EU member states in the Political and Security Committee on the work of the EU mission and the co-operation with Kosovo authorities.
They said that state building and combating corruption and organised crime remain the priorities.
The two officials praised Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's "constructive approach" to EULEX investigations concerning government officials.
De Kermabon confirmed that he will remain head of the mission until the end of the year, unless a replacement is found earlier.
His official mandate ends on June 14th.

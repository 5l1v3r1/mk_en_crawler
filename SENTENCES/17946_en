ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Liberals' reaffirmed their support for Croatia's EU bid during a two-day conference late last week in Zagreb, organised by the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR).
Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ELDR leader, said the European Liberals do not believe that Croatia's bid should be affected by the Union's internal institutional problems regarding expansion, and said the EU should preserve its open-door policy towards other Western Balkan states.

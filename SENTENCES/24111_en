BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU plans to open two new chapters in Turkey's accession negotiations this week, on free movement of capital and information society and media, according to media reports Tuesday (December 16th).
Greek Cypriots have blocked France's efforts to open the negotiation chapter on energy, which is considered particularly important in view of the EU's drive to diversify energy supply routes.
Cyprus decided to veto the opening following a row with Turkey over oil exploration activities in the Mediterranean Sea.
In other news Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan warned that negative messages coming from Brussels could create doubt over the EU's commitment to Turkey.
Meeting with EU countries' ambassadors to Turkey, he called on members to distance themselves from approaches that "damage trust in the EU".

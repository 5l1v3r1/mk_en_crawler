ANKARA, Turkey -- Countries in Central and Eastern Europe have managed to avoid their own financial crises but the risks remain, three huge lenders -- the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank and the World Bank -- said in a joint statement Tuesday (October 6th), the first day of IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Istanbul. 
At the beginning of the year, the three institutions launched an initiative to finance economies in the region, allocating nearly 25 billion euros. 
"We expect stable recovery next year for Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey," the head of UniCredit bank's operations for Central and Eastern Europe, Frederico Ghizzioni, said. 
As a whole, the IMF and the World Bank said that while the global economy is coming out of recession, unemployment will climb in the next 12 months.
The meetings sparked large-scale protests in Istanbul. 
On Tuesday, police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters in Taksim Square, only 100m from the building where conferences were taking place. 
Protesters threw Molotov cocktails near the congress centre, where finance ministers and others were discussing the global economy. 
Reports on the number of arrests vary significantly. 
Clashes continue on Wednesday.

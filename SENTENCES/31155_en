SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The two main Serb parties -- the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats and the Serb Democratic Party -- together with the main Croat parties HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990, will meet next week in an attempt to form a majority in the state-level parliament, local media reported on Monday (January 3rd).
The Bosniak parties are also invited to the meeting but the Social Democratic Party has reportedly refused to attend, while the Party of Democratic Action has yet to decide.
Still, the Party for BiH and the Union for a Better Future, led by Fahrudin Radoncic, the owner of the country's largest daily newspaper Dnevni Avaz, have agreed to come, making it possible that the Serb and Croat parties form a majority in the state-level parliament with those two parties.

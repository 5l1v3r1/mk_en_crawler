SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The leader of the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), Ahmed Dogan, suggested in a media interview Monday (20 June) that MRF -- now a junior partner in the coalition cabinet led by NMS-II -- is prepared to work with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) in forming a new government. 
The comment, to Reuters, comes just days before the 25 June parliamentary elections. 
Dogan did not, however, exclude the possibility of MRF entering a broad right-centrist coalition with its present allies from NMS-II, though he made clear that MRF would first seek talks with BSP.
Separately, 24 Chasa published an interview Tuesday with BSP leader Sergey Stanishev. 
He is quoted as saying that while it is too early to discuss coalitions, BSP would not summarily reject any invitation for collaboration after the elections.

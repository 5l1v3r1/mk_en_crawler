BUCHAREST, Romania -- Tens of thousands of public sector employees staged a rally in Bucharest on Wednesday (May 19th) to protest planned wage cuts of 25% and pension cuts of 15%.
They are to take effect in less than two weeks, as part of the country's agreement with the IMF.
Police say about 30,000 people protested on Wednesday, while unions said the actual figure was closer to 50,000.
It was one of the biggest demonstrations since the Romanian Revolution that overthrew communism in 1989.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks met with Canadian Senate Speaker Noel Kinsella on Monday (28 August) in Zagreb, the first meeting on the parliamentary level since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1993.
Kinsella voiced his country's support for Croatia's reform and democratisation efforts, and promised Canada's assistance along the path to Euro-Atlantic integration.
In meetings with President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, the focus was possible changes to the visa regime.
Also Monday, Finance Minister Ivan Suker signed memorandums of understanding with the European Commission that would allow Croatia to join two EU programmes:
Customs 2007 and Fiscalis 2003-2007.
They aim to improve the efficiency of the tax and customs administrations.

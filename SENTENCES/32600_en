BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska government decided on Friday (28 February) to appoint Dusan Mijatovic as the new general director of the entity's electricity utility, RS Elektroprivreda.
Dragan Andjelic and Milenko Cvijanovic were appointed as assistant directors.
The decision followed last month's request by the Office of the High Representative (OHR) for replacements, after an OHR audit revealed that some $90m had been embezzled at the company.

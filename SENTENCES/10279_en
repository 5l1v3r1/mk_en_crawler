ZAGREB, Croatia -- General Harald Kujat, the chairman of NATO's Military Committee, urged the military leaders of Croatia to continue reforming the country's armed forces if they want to achieve the goal of joining the Alliance. 
Croatia hopes to become a member in 2007. 
The country adopted a programme in 2002 that would reduce the army from 40,000 military and civilian staff to 27,000.
In other news, a court in Vukovar has reopened the case of ten Croatian Serbs, accused of expelling Croats from the village of Bapska during the 1991-1995 conflict. 
The Supreme Court overturned an earlier guilty verdict and ordered a retrial. 
All ten defendants are being tried in absentia.
Also Monday, President Stipe Mesic said 2 January would be the most likely date for the presidential elections, with campaigns starting 30 days before that. 
He predicts he will win in the first round.

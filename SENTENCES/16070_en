SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The business community wants the labour ministry to introduce quotas for foreigners working in the local market starting next year, says Bulgarian Industrial Chamber Deputy Chairman Dikran Tebeyan.
In comments Thursday (November 16th), he said this would avoid a restriction in the employment promotion act, which limits the number of foreigners working at a company to no more than 10% of personnel.
The ministry would determine the size of the quotas each year, in co-operation with the major business associations.
They say quotas should favour EU citizens first, followed by non-residents of Bulgarian origin.

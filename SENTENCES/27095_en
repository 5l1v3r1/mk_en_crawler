SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dutch soldiers found two mass graves in their former military base in Srebrenica, a town where more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed in 1995, local media reported on Friday (July 31st).
The graves -- which contained at least eight civilians' bodies -- were first revealed by families of the Srebrenica massacre victims last month.

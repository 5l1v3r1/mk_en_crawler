BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A Lebanese ship loaded with aid will not leave for Gaza on Sunday (August 22nd) as planned after Cyprus refused to allow it to enter its waters or to use its ports, organisers said on Saturday. 
The Saint Mariam ship -- carrying women activists and humanitarian aid -- was set to leave from the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli for Gaza. 
Organisers said they are now trying to find another port from which to sail. 
Israel has warned it could use "all necessary means" to stop the Gaza-bound ship. 
Cypriot police spokesperson Michalis Katsounotos told Reuters on Friday that the arrival and departure of vessels to or from Gaza via Cyprus ports is prohibited. 
Authorities introduced the ban last year, citing national interests.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission's (EC) Greek representative said on Wednesday (May 25th) that Athens must make sacrifices to overcome its debt crisis, warning that failing to do so might force the country to leave the eurozone.
"The greatest (achievement) of post-war Greece -- the euro and the country's European course -- are in danger," Maria Damanaki, the EU's fisheries commissioner, said in a statement.
According to her, "the scenario of Greece distancing itself from the euro is on the table." "We either agree with our creditors on a programme of tough sacrifices that brings results and assume the responsibilities for our past, or we return to the drachma," she added.
The opposition was fast to react.
"It is a great mistake for some to want to turn an economic problem into a problem of institutions," New Democracy spokesperson Yiannis Mihelakis said.

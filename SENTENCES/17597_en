THESSALONIKI, Greece -- The Turkish and Greek armed forces are eager to overcome tensions over disputed airspace and to strengthen relations, Turkey's Chief of Staff General Yasar Buyukanit said on Thursday (April 19th), wrapping up a two-day trip to Greece. 
He added that the only way to resolve outstanding issues would be to create a climate of confidence and stability. 
Last year, Greek and Turkish fighter planes collided over the Aegean Sea, killing the Greek pilot. 
Earlier this week, Buyukanit proposed the end of armed military flights over the Aegean.
In other news Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the ruling Justice and Development Party would surprise the public with its presidential candidate, who will be unveiled next week. 
Analysts say this indicates Erdogan won't be running, as he is considered the frontrunner for the nomination.

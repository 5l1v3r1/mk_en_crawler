MADRID, Spain -- Separately on Friday (December 19th), Spain and Denmark announced they are removing current labour market restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers. 
Spanish Minister of Labour and Immigration Celectino Corbacho Chaves said restrictions have become useless. 
Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said the government hopes "many Romanians and Bulgarians would return to their homelands where campaigns to attract emigrants have been launched".
Denmark also decided to lift restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers, effective in May 2009.

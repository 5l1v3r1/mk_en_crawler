BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslavia is looking to raise several million dollars in cash from the sale of Tito's luxury limousines, according to Belgrade media reports Wednesday (29 January). 
A Rolls Royce Phantom 5 with 600 spare parts will be sold at an auction together with five Mercedes produced between 1967 and 1978. 
Several BMW motorcycles and motorcade cars will also be put on the block. 
Montenegro sold Tito's yacht to a US businessman for $2.1m several years ago.

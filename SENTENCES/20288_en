NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with proposals aimed at resolving disputes with Turkish Cypriots on the divided island, government spokesman Vassilis Palmas announced on Tuesday (October 16th).
The letter contains an eight-point proposal for the immediate implementation of the so-called July 8th 2006 agreement, signed between Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.
Separately Tuesday, Talat met with Ban at UN headquarters in New York and outlined a new proposal of his own.
Talat described it later as an updated version of the one he proposed in 2006.
In other news, Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou Marcoullis accused Turkey on Tuesday of preparing a Kosovo-style scenario for the breakaway Northern Cyprus.
Nicosia will not accept such a scenario, Marcoullis told a press conference in Vienna, where she met Austrian counterpart Ursula Plasnik.

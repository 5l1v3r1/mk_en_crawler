TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) spent another day Thursday (May 19th) counting ballots inadvertently cast in the wrong boxes during the May 8th local elections.
The decision to include them has shifted the lead in Tirana's mayoral race to ruling Democratic Party candidate Lulzim Basha over incumbent Edi Rama, head of the opposition Socialist Party (SP).
That has sparked SP-led protests in the capital and elsewhere.
On Thursday, opposition supporters tried to break through a cordon of hundreds of police officers, including Special Forces, ringing the CEC building.
Police ended up charging 17 SP lawmakers and seven protestors for obstructing officials from their duties.
SP supporters reportedly blocked a number of important national roads to protest what they describe as the manipulated vote count.

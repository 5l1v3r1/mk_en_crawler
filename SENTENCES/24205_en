SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- By a unanimous vote, the US House of Representatives approved a resolution calling for constitutional changes in BiH, local media reported on Tuesday(May 12th). 
Backers say the reforms would make BiH a more effective state, especially with respect to EU and NATO integration efforts. 
The "non-biding" resolution urges BiH authorities to co-operate with The Hague war crimes tribunal and envisions the appointment of a special US envoy for the Balkans, who would work with the EU and political leaders in BiH to implement all necessary reforms. 
The resolution passed ahead of US Vice-President Joe Biden's upcoming visit to BiH. 
The Bosniak member of the tripartite presidency, Haris Silajdzic, welcomed the document as a concrete commitment by the US administration towards BiH. 
The Bosnian Croat HDZ 1990 party also welcomed the resolution. 
But Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said there will be no constitutional reform if the international community leads the process.

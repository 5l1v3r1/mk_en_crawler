BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Senate gave a green light Tuesday (August 26th) to high-level corruption probes against Labour Minister Paul Pacuraru and former Economy Minister Codrut Seres.
Seres faces charges of espionage and treason, stemming from the privatisation process, as well as allegedly providing classified commercial information related to the sale of state-owned companies.
Pacuraru faces charges of bribery and abuse of office.
Prosecutors say a company owned by his son won a contract with a state-owned company in exchange for keeping a senior official with the Gorj labour inspectorate at his post.
Both officials have denied any wrongdoing.

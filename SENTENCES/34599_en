TIRANA, Albania -- Meeting with members of his diplomatic corps on Friday (29 August), Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano denied that his government favoured the formation of a Greater Albania that would include Kosovo.
He also urged Serb refugees to return to the province.
Echoing a statement by President Alfred Moisiu earlier in the week, Nano called on Albanian diplomats to boost the country's image abroad.
On the subject of Kosovo, meanwhile, new UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri reminded ethnic Albanians and Serbs that it is up to the UN Security Council to decide its future status.
Holkeri also criticised last week's declaration by the Serbian Parliament, which reaffirmed Serbia's sovereign claims regarding Kosovo.

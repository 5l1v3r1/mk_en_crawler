PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- UNMIK chief Michael Steiner appointed 42 new local judges for the province on Thursday (12 December). 
Some 21 Serbs, 19 Albanians, one Bosnian, and one Gorani will join the 341 judges who are already serving. 
"This represents a necessary and timely advancement in the establishment of a multiethnic, professional and impartial judiciary in Kosovo," said UN spokeswoman Izabella Karlowicz. 
The appointment of the judges is aimed at strengthening the province's independent judiciary.

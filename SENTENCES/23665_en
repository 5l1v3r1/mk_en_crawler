ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prosecutors at The Hague war crimes tribunal have not received documents on the use of artillery by Croatian forces during their effort to regain control of the Krajina region as part of the 1995 Operation Storm, tribunal spokeswoman Olga Kavran said on Wednesday (April 22nd). 
The prosecutors requested the documents as early as November 2006 for use in the trial of Croatian generals Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, who allegedly committed war crimes during the operation. 
Croatia has submitted some documents but not all. 
Prosecutors say they are looking for over 100 documents, while Croatia believes it has to provide a total of 23. 
Some EU countries have expressed reservations about opening key chapters of Croatia's accession talks before resolution of the matter.

ANKARA, Turkey -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has promised that the United States will help Turkey prevent the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) from launching attacks from Iraqi territory. 
Speaking to reporters Friday (November 2nd) on her way to Ankara, she urged Turkey to refrain from attacking PKK targets in Iraq. 
"Anything that would destabilise the north of Iraq is not going to be in Turkey's interests, it is not going to be in our interests and it is not going to be in the Iraqis' interests," Rice said. 
She said that in addition to adopting a long-term strategy to deal with the issue, the United States would implement measures to improve intelligence sharing with Turkey and make it more difficult for the PKK to operate out of northern Iraq. 
Since the PKK was a common enemy to Turkey, the United States and Iraq, the three countries should deal with it together, she said.
Rice is scheduled to meet with President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan. 
She is also expected to discuss the PKK with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on the sidelines of a conference on Iraq in Istanbul.

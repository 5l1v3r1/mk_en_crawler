TIRANA, Albania -- Several pro-government newspapers on Monday (February 12th) published nude photographs of Socialist Party leader Edi Rama, prompting protests from the opposition. 
The pictures were reportedly taken 12 years ago at a beach in southern France. 
Following their publication, Rama accused the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and chairman Sali Berisha of "moral degradation" and interference in people's private lives. 
Most opposition leaders also condemned the release of the pictures, accusing the DP of using unfair and dangerous tactics ahead of the February 18th local elections. 
The Helsinki Committee of Albania also weighed in on the incident, suggesting Rama's rights had been violated. 
The DP denies Berisha had anything to do with the scandal.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH police reform remains a key condition for sealing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, top officials of the bloc told BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic in Brussels on Tuesday (18 July).
They generally expressed satisfaction with the pace of the technical negotiations related to the SAA, but stressed that the accord would be possible only if the domestic agreement on the police reforms is implemented.
Also Tuesday, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH dismissed the possibility of new political negotiations on police sector restructuring.
The suggestion was recently made by Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Ivanic.

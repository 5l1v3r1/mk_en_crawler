TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha welcomes the opposition's readiness to amend the constitution concerning immunity for lawmakers.
"We have agreed publicly with the head of the Socialist Party (SP), Edi Rama, to break down the wall of immunity in Albania," Berisha said on Monday (May 12th) at a meeting of his ruling Democratic Party (DP).
He said the opposition's support shows political maturity and a willingness to demonstrate that everyone is equal before the law.
He argues such reforms help Albania move towards EU membership.
Germany's Norbert Lamert echoed that sentiment during a trip to Tirana on Monday.
The speaker of the parliament, the Bundestag, said, "Changes are possible, but they require time and are a precondition to join the EU.
Only changes make integration possible." (Shekulli - 13/05/08;

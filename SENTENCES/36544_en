ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski told a Croatian newspaper that he did not order the killings of six Pakistanis and an Indian in 2002, as charged. 
The government in Skopje revealed last week that the seven men were immigrants looking for jobs in the West when they were killed by police to impress Europe and the United States in the fight against terror. 
According to the interview published Saturday (8 May), Boskovski reiterated his earlier claims that authorities at the time were acting on information they had received from foreign intelligence services. 
He fled to Croatia shortly before his indictment was announced last week. 
Zagreb has rejected an extradition request from Macedonia because Boskovski also holds Croatian citizenship.

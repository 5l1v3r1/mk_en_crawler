ROME, Italy -- Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul arrived on Monday (10 November) to attend the EU Troika meeting and meet with EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen.
Gul says his government is determined to implement EU reforms and will take important steps to that end in coming months.
He added that Turkey would work to reach an agreement on the reunification of Cyprus after the election in Northern Cyprus.
In a related development, European Commission representative to Turkey Hans Joerg Kretschmer said Monday that Cyprus would become a member of the EU in May, and that Turkey cannot continue to aspire towards EU membership if it does not recognise a member state.

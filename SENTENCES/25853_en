ZAGREB, Croatia -- Fellow parliament members stripped lawmaker Berislav Roncevic of his immunity from prosecution on Friday (October 16th), clearing the way for legal proceedings against the former defence minister.
Prosecutors want to charge him over a 2004 procurement deal involving military trucks.
They say the contract cost the state millions of kunas.
Ivo Bacic, a former assistant to the defence minister, will also face criminal charges.
If convicted, Roncevic faces up to ten years in prison.
He is a member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union.

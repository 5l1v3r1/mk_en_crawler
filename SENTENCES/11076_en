BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic denied on Tuesday (28 December) that talks were under way with war crimes indictees about surrendering to the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
He also said Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus' recent statement about the surrender and extradition of four police and army generals wanted by the tribunal was not the result of any official government decision.
Labus has said his G17 party, a member of the ruling coalition, will push for extraditing the generals by 27 January 2005.

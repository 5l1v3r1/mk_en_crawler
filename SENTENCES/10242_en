ZAGREB, Croatia -- Efficient co-operation between Southeast European countries and mutual efforts to resolve open issues prove the region's maturity and readiness for eventual EU integration, Croatian President Stipe Mesic told a regional conference in Zagreb Saturday (25 September).
Representatives attended from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro and NGOs.
Mesic stressed the need to "get rid of the legacy of the past" and to seek new solutions to longstanding problems, stressing also the importance of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic issued a statement in support, urging all regional political leaders to commit to full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.

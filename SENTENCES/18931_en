BUCHAREST, Romania -- As expected, Deputy Prime Minister Marko Bela, who has been overseeing culture, education and European integration, resigned on Tuesday (July 3rd).
Bela, who leads ethnic Hungarian UDMR, said he was leaving the government in order to better handle party duties ahead of the autumn elections for European Parliament members and next year's general elections.
He first mentioned plans to resign in May.
In other news Tuesday, former Finance Ministry employee Marcu Nicu was elected president of the newly established National Integrity Agency.

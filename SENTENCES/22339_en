TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided on Wednesday (June 11th) to allocate about 742,000 euros in additional funds to compensate those affected by the March 15th explosions at an ammunition depot in the village of Gerdec.
During a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Sali Berisha noted that since the wave of explosions spread miles away from the epicentre, part of the funds will reimburse owners of buildings in surrounding villages.
The blasts killed 26 people, injured more than 200 and destroyed hundreds of buildings.

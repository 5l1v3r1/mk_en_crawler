SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The conflict between two junior parties in Macedonia's ruling coalition escalated Thursday (November 15th) when the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) initiated a no-confidence procedure against Deputy Prime Minister Zivko Jankulovski of the New Social Democratic Party (NDSP). 
The DPA says he has failed to restructure the education and agricultural sectors, which continue to burden the state budget. 
The DPA also threatened to seek the removal of Economy Minister Vera Rafajlovska, also of the NDSP. 
The party recently backed a motion to dismiss DPA's Deputy Interior Minister Refet Elmazi. 
Local media reports suggest the tit-for-tat may signal the disintegration of the ruling coalition.

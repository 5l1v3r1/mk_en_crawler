SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian completely ruled out the possible division of BiH, a scenario recently raised by Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament, media reported on Sunday (October 19th). 
The Peace Implementation Council Steering Board has said repeatedly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of BiH rest on international law and are guaranteed by the UN and the international community, Gregorian underlined. 
"BiH cannot be divided, and anyone who tries to do so will face serious consequences," he insisted. 
He also rejected any criticism of the work and role of the Office of the High Representative. 
"Politicians here are good at saying what is wrong with the status quo. 
What they have proven incapable of doing is offering a vision of the future," Gregorian said. 
In recent weeks, several high-ranking officials have urged the EU to refocus attention on BiH. 
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, for example, compared relations between Sarajevo and Banja Luka to those between the Czech Republic and Slovakia before separation.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR and EULEX said in a statement Sunday (January 4th) that they are building up their presence in Mitrovica to prevent any potential violence.
The statement came as Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic urged international forces in northern Kosovo to prevent provocations and escalating tensions of the past several days.
"The violence that we have witnessed ...
is unacceptable.
Albanian police officers [in Kosovo] should understand that it is in nobody's interest to destabilise Kosovo any further," Bogdanovic told journalists in Mitrovica, where he met representatives of the Serbian community.
State Secretary of the Serbian Ministry for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic called for stability Sunday.
"It is very important that we maintain peace and stability, and no provocations should be made," Ivanovic said.
Meanwhile, the government in Kosovo says it can deal with the situation but will wait for the right moment.
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Sunday that while the government is not exercising its authority in the north, other security structures are -- such as KFOR and EULEX.

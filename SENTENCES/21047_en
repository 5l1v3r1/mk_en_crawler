SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement Thursday (August 2nd), the Office of the High Representative and the Delegation of the European Commission to BiH expressed concern that parliament failed to ratify the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) at its last session before the summer recess. 
Free trade means jobs, and ratifying the agreement should be a top priority when the MPs return in September, the statement said. 
It downplayed concerns that CEFTA would harm certain groups of producers, saying the accord would facilitate direct foreign investment, improve transparency, and apply international trade system rules.

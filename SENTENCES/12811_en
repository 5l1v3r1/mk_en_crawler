BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police chief Radomir Njegus resigned Thursday (2 December) after he was accused of obstructing efforts to hunt down war crimes suspects.
Republika Srpska Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic said recently that Njegus was hampering co-operation with the UN tribunal.
In other news, Matijasevic said Thursday that Bosnian Serb police had carried out an unsuccessful operation to arrest Ljubomir Borovcanin, a suspect charged in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Chief UN prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said during a visit to Sarajevo Thursday that the new Bosnian war crimes chamber should hold its first trial in early January.
She said the UN tribunal plans to transfer a number of cases to the Bosnian court.

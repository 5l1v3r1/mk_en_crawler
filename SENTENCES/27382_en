PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Transport and Telecommunications Fatmir Limaj, suspected of soliciting bribes, money laundering, organised crime and fraud in office, has hired three US-based lawyers, despite the fact that no charges have been filed against him, media reported on Thursday (May 27th). 
Lawyers Stephan Seeger and Ryan O'Neill have already arrived in the country, while the third lawyer, Mark Sherman, is in the United States, to lobby on the issue. 
"This is a transition country, and not everything is safe here. 
There have been concerns amongst his American supporters, who want him to have the appropriate legal representation," Seeger told the Greenwich Times. 
In late April, EULEX police raided the offices of the transport and telecommunications ministry and Limaj's house, reportedly in connection with questionable road construction tenders.

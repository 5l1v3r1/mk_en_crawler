ANKARA, Turkey -- The outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) kidnapped three German climbers on Tuesday (July 8th) from a group of 13 mountaineers in the eastern province of Agri, provincial Governor Mehmet Cetin said.
He said the Kurdish militants abducted the climbers as a reprisal for Berlin's recent actions against PKK associations and supporters in Germany.
In other news, a roadside bomb attributed to the PKK injured eight soldiers and one village guard in the province of Hakkari, local media reported.

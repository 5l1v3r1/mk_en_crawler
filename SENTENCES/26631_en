ZAGREB, Croatia -- Voters went to the polls Sunday (January 10th) for the presidential run-off.
Ivo Josipovic of the Social Democratic Party won the first round on December 27th but he failed to attract over 50% of the support, sending him into round two against runner-up Milan Bandic, the mayor of Zagreb.
Polls suggest Josipovic will win handily Sunday.
Meanwhile, anti-corruption police announced on Friday that they are investigating Bandic for suspected involvement in several graft cases.
Police official Vuk Djuricic told Reuters that the fact that Bandic is being investigated does not mean he will be indicted.

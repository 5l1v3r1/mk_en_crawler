ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda visited parliament Thursday (March 10th) and met with Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor. 
Purda was detained last month at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant. 
Authorities in Belgrade suspected him of involvement in war crimes committed against Serbs in Vukovar early in the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Serbia, however, dropped the case earlier this month due to lack of evidence. 
Kosor said after the meeting that she is happy Purda is "finally back with his family" and stressed that Zagreb is doing its best to make sure what happened to him "does not ever happen again".

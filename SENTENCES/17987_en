TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu on Friday (January 19th) distributed a draft code of conduct to all political parties that will run in the February 18th municipal vote. 
The president urged the parties to commit to observing the document, which outlines the rules for a tolerant, democratic and fair pre-election campaign. 
Moisiu emphasised that the forthcoming poll was of extreme importance for the country's democratic future and Euro-Atlantic bid. 
He also called for proper coverage by the media, as well as restraint from any provocation and violence.

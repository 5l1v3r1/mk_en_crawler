SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Canada has informed Macedonian authorities that it plans to close its consular office in Skopje by 31 March, citing economic reasons. 
However, there is media speculation that the move is a response to failed negotiations between the Macedonian government and Post Canada over a proposal for the latter to administer post offices in Macedonia.

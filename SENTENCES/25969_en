PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police have launched an investigation into the operations of Post and Telecommunications of Kosovo (PTK) following a request from an international prosecutor, local media reported on Friday (September 18th).
Sources tell the Pristina-based daily Zeri that EULEX police have started investigating an agreement on a Virtual Mobile Operator, signed last year between the PTK and Dardaphone.
Investigators suspect that the agreement is to the detriment of the PTK.
Company officials confirm they have visited the Department of the International Prosecutor's Office and have provided the required information.
However, the PTK has refused any comment as the investigation is under way.
Dardaphone is a privately owned company licensed to operate in Kosovo's telecommunications market.

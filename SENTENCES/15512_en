BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors reportedly questioned a former state official Friday (November 24th) in relation to a scandal involving energy privatisation deals struck in recent years. 
Local media reported on Saturday that the former deputy head of the Office for State Assets and Privatisation in Industry, Dorinel Mucea, was interrogated for four hours and was later barred from leaving Bucharest, should new hearings be held. 
Mucea reportedly is suspected of economic espionage for allegedly passing confidential information related to the privatisation of five Romanian companies to a Bulgarian citizen, Stamen Stanchev, who had suspected links to organised crime. 
Romania's judicial authorities announced last week that they were launching probes into energy sector privatisation.

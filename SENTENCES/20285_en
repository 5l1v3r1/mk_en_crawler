THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeals chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (October 16th) confirmed the acquittal of a Bosnian Muslim general whose troops killed 62 Croat civilians in Mostar in 1993.
The judges found that there was no evidence to prove that Sefer Halilovic was in effective control of the soldiers who committed the murders.
He was chief of staff of the Muslim army at the time of the killings.
Halilovic, 55, was indicted by UN prosecutors in 2001 and immediately surrendered to the tribunal.
He was cleared of all charges in 2005 but prosecutors appealed the verdict.

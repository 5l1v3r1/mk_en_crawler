STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Thursday (12 May) that the 1999 trial of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan was unfair.
The judges faulted Turkish authorities for failing to provide the defendant with adequate access to lawyers and preventing him from reading in detail the charges against him for a number of months.
Many in Turkey fear the decision by the international court could destabilise the country and fuel anti-EU sentiments ahead of accession talks in October.
On Wednesday meanwhile, Turkish armed forces killed three Kurdish terrorists in a battle in eastern Turkey.
Authorities also warned the public that the PKK might be planning bomb attacks on major urban centres.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted on Monday (22 August) to approve the government's plan to privatise the state-run firm NIS. 
The oil giant employs 17,000 workers. 
Its sale has been one of the key conditions for continued IMF support. 
The Fund also wants a reform of the country's pensions system before providing further loans and endorsing Serbia's economic and financial policies.
In other news, thieves have stolen 700kg of anode mud from the now defunct Bor mining complex. 
Serbian police say the mud could yield as much as 1kg of gold and 6kgs of silver, plus other valuable metals.
Also Monday, Serbian President Boris Tadic met with Croatian musician Darko Rundek, who was attacked by several youths late last week as he toured Serbia. 
Tadic apologised for the ethnically charged incident, calling it disgraceful.

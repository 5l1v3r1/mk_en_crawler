ZAGREB, Croatia -- The suspected killer of Bosnian football fan was freed on Wednesday (October 21st), a day after surrendering to police. 
Oliver Knezovic holds both Croatian and Bosnian citizenship, and a Zagreb judge ruled he cannot be extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina as the two countries have no extradition agreement. 
Bosnian police arrested him in early October shortly after the killing of Vedran Puljic in the Bosnian town of Siroki Brijeg. 
Knezovic managed to escape from detention and fled to Croatia.

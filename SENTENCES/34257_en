ZAGREB, Croatia -- Zagreb hosted an international conference Wednesday (2 July) on minority integration, co-organised by the OSCE and the Croatian Institute for International Relations. 
Opening the conference, Croatian President Stipe Mesic said that tolerance in international relations "must be accompanied by tolerance within the borders of all states".
Also Wednesday, the parties forming Croatia's ruling coalition met in Zagreb to discuss Prime Minister Ivica Racan's proposals for restructuring the government and public administration. 
He wants to reduce the number of cabinet ministries from 19 to 14 to boost efficiency.

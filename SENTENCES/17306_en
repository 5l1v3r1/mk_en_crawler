BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Saturday (April 28th) advised the Turkish Army not to intervene in the country's presidential election process. 
"This is a test case of whether the Turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations," he said.
In Washington, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said "we hope and expect that the Turks will work out these political issues in their own way, in a way thatâs consistent with their secular democracy and constitutional provisions." Asked about Friday's controversial statement by the Turkish military, he said the United States was not taking sides in the dispute.

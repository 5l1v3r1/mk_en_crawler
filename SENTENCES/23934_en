SOFIA Bulgaria -- The national council of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) decided on Saturday (July 18th) to keep outgoing Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev as party leader, local media reported.
Stanishev had called for a vote of confidence after the party lost the July 5th parliamentary elections to the right-wing Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB).
The BSP managed to attract only 18% of the votes.
In other news, newly elected Parliament Speaker Tsetska Tsacheva said on Sunday the new parliament will work to abolish members' immunity from prosecution.
Right now, at least two lawmakers are immune from prosecution for fraud:
former Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski and Volen Siderov, leader of the ultra-nationalist Attack party.

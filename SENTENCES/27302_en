TIRANA, Albania -- The military is reportedly working to destroy by 2013 all old ammunition inherited from the communist regime. 
About 184,000 tonnes of Soviet-Chinese ammunition will be destroyed in an effort to reduce the potential risk the stockpile poses to those living near storage areas across Albania, local media reported on Saturday (February 27th). 
Albania imported massive amounts of ammunition to defend itself during Enver Hoxha's regime, though the arsenal was never used. 
An estimated 90,000 tonnes have been cleared since the military started eliminating it in the early 1990s.

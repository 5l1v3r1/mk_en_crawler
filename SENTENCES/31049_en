PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political parties have violated the Code of Conduct in the first days of official campaigning, the coalition of monitoring NGOs Democracy in Action said on Sunday (December 5th).
Violations include putting posters in public buildings, bringing children to campaign appearances and obstructing regular school hours in some cases.
In the same statement, Democracy in Action noted that more than 60,000 euros have been spent by main political parties on newspaper ads alone.
More than half of that was spent by outgoing Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's ruling Democratic Party.
Campaigning for the December 12th snap elections started on December 1st and will last ten days.

TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Wednesday (June 2nd) he would like to see a solution to the political crisis in Albania before the European Parliament (EP) discusses lifting the visa regime.
"I would not like to answer on behalf of other institutions, however the EP respects EC decisions," Fuele said during the EU-Western Balkans conference in Sarajevo.
Spanish Foreign Minister Migel Angel Moratinos said he expects a positive decision regarding visas for Albania, saying Albanians will be able to benefit from the decision soon.
Foreign Minister Ilir Meta, who also attended the conference, expressed concern about the consequences, should the political crisis drag on.
"It will be an undeserved punishment for Albanians and a disappointment for the European structures that want to help Albania," Meta said.

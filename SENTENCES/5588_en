No one in Republika Srpska (RS) was surprised when Milorad Dodik's Independent Union of Social Democrats (SNSD) declared victory following elections Sunday (October 3rd) in Republika Srpksa.
The party was the clear front-runner in the Bosnian Serb entity, and not even a united front by the opposition was able to stem the tide.
"RS needs stability and I will do my best to provide stability and unity for RS on every important issue concerning its future and its status," said Dodik, who succeeded in his bid to become the entity's new president.
Many say he based his campaign on nationalist rhetoric, and on the idea that RS should seek independence from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
After preliminary results were in, he repeated the SNSD slogan "RS forever, and BiH as long as it has to be".
"We will fight for the original Dayton Peace Accord, as it has been written, not the way someone is interpreting it.
BiH can hardly be a state in the sense which the international community wants.
It can only be a state based on the original Dayton," he said.
His main opponent, Ognjen Tadic, admitted defeat almost immediately.
He had run on behalf of a coalition consisting of three parties â€“ his own Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS RS).
Though the parties succeeded in forging a united front, the effort failed to pay off.
After the preliminary results came in, Tadic said he would not take any responsibilty for the Bosnian Serb entity over then next four years.
The only message he had for citizens of RS was a terse one:
"Good night, Republika Srpska."
Dodik's party has won a majority of between 42% and 44%, according to the early results, while second place goes to the SDS and the PDP is in third.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic said on Tuesday (July 6th) that inspections conducted at Belgrade's Oncology Institute turned up no unusual doses of cytostatic medications being prescribed to patients, adding that people were treated in accordance with international standards. 
Milosavljevic said experts and inspectors have checked the work of the institute from 2003 until now and discovered no irregularities. 
The emergency inspection began on July 1st after Oncology Institute Director Nenad Borojevic and nine co-workers were arrested on corruption charges. 
They are accused of prescribing and obtaining larger quantities of cytostatic medications than necessary in order to favour certain pharmaceutical companies. 
Police alleged they received nearly 1m euros in bribes.

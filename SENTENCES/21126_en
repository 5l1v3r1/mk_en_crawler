SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A day after BiH politicians rejected the draft police reform proposal submitted by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, claiming it would favour Repubilka Srpska (RS) police structures, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik also criticised the document.
Dodik said he reviewed the proposal on Friday (August 31st), and said that it was unconstitutional and not in compliance with RS' positions.
Earlier on Friday, the European Commission voiced support for the draft and criticised BiH politicians for their rejection and unwillingness to negotiate a compromise.
EC Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned BiH that if there is no agreement on police restructuring by the end of September, the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) will be postponed indefinitely.

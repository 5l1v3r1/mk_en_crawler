ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte says fugitive General Ante Gotovina still has a large network of domestic supporters, including members of Croatia's intelligence services.
In an exclusive interview with the daily Vjesnik on Friday (6 May), del Ponte asserted that Zagreb authorities are in touch with Gotovina and are trying to persuade him to surrender.
She added that real efforts to resolve his case began only recently, when the government finally realised that EU entry talks will not begin until Gotovina is in The Hague.

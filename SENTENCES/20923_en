BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's President Boris Tadic received the Europe Prize for Political Culture at a ceremony held Saturday (August 4th) in Switzerland. 
The president said he was honoured as a person who is deeply committed to Serbia's EU integration progress.
The award, which also includes a prize of 50,000 euros, was established in 2006 by the Hans Ringier Foundation. 
Tadic plans to donate the money to a maternity ward in a hospital in Gracanica, a Serb enclave in Kosovo.

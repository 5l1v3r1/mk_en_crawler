SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Talks on constitutional reforms involving political leaders, US and EU officials will continue, the US Embassy in Sarajevo confirmed on Saturday (November 14th), without elaborating on the exact timing. 
The talks will resume at different levels, with US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Stuart Jones expected to participate. 
Two rounds of talks last month ended without any agreement on reforms needed to end the political stalemate in BiH and to move it closer to NATO and EU accession.

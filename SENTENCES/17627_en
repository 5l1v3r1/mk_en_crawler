BELGRADE, Serbia -- Just over a week after parliamentary elections were held in Serbia, President Boris Tadic plans to start political consultations Monday (January 29th) on forming a new government.
He will hold talks with leaders of the parliamentary parties, starting with the Serbian Radical Party and the Democratic Party, which came in first and second, respectively.
The last day of scheduled talks is Thursday, when he will meet with the leaders of five parties representing ethnic minorities that won seats.
Tadic will then name the new prime minister-designate.
In other news, Vuk Draskovic is keeping his job as leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO).
The junior coalition partner in the current cabinet failed to pass the 5% election threshold last week, prompting Draskovic to offer his resignation.
On Saturday, SPO refused to accept it, saying he was not responsible for the poor performance.

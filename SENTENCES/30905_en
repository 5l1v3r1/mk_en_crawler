ATHENS, Greece -- More than 300 prisoners have launched a hunger strike to protest overcrowded detention facilities, authorities announced on Wednesday (December 8th). 
According to the justice ministry, "part of the prisoners" in 16 of the 33 jails in the country, where 12,600 people are serving time, are participating in the protest, and 315 have joined the hunger strike. 
But organisers say the numbers are far higher: 9,000 inmates in 26 prisons have joined the protest, with more than 1,000 of them started the hunger strike. 
The protestors insist on better living conditions and on limiting the time spent in preliminary custody after arrest. 
The justice ministry says it is determined to "liberalise the prison system", urging inmates to be patient.

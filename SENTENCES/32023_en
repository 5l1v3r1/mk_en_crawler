ANKARA, Turkey -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), said Thursday (21 November) that constitutional changes would be sought to allow him to become prime minister.
According to law, a 1999 conviction for promoting religious intolerance prevents him from assuming any post higher than deputy minister.
Erdogan says amending certain texts in the constitution should take no more than a month.
AKP has 363 out of 550 seats in parliament, just four short of the 367 needed to revise the constitution without holding a referendum.

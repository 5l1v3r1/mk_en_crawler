SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin says his trip to the United States last week was successful and marked by "trust, friendship and partnership".
Speaking on Saturday (December 23rd) he said bilateral ties with Washington in the political and military fields are excellent but more should be done in terms of economic relations.
Kalfin said US companies are interested in the Bulgarian defence industry and opportunities for investment in military supply, IT and electronics.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Friday (March 21st) that Serbia has no intention of seeking the division of Kosovo. 
In an interview for the Pink TV channel, he said Serbia simply wants to be represented in northern Kosovo, in order to be able to help the Serb community there.
Referring to Kosovo Minister Slobodan Samardzic, who has been advocating the division of Kosovo along ethnic lines, Tadic said such a policy has not been approved by the government.
Samardzic presented his views to UNMIK deputy head Larry Rossin last week, without government approval. 
He claimed, however, that the proposal was part of an action plan adopted by the government on January 14th. 
Speaking to the newspaper Politika on Saturday, he said a functional division should be introduced in all parts of Kosovo where Serbs live, and not only in the north. 
"We accept Resolution 1244 and UNMIK police, justice and customs jurisdiction, but after the unilateral declaration of independence, only the Serbs, with the help of Serbs, can implement these authorities," Samardzic said.

ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis says Greece will not allow Macedonia to join NATO or the EU until the two countries resolve their long-standing name dispute. 
"Our policy towards Skopje has only one goal -- the settlement of the name dispute," Bakoyannis stressed in an interview with the daily Ta nea on Monday (October 27th). 
"Only when we reach a compromise will we back [Macedonia's] accession to the EU and NATO," she said.
Both Sweden and the United States voiced support for Macedonia's integration bids Monday. 
After a meeting in Skopje with Deputy Prime Minister for EU Affairs Ivica Bocevski, Swedish State Secretary for European Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom described the name dispute as a bilateral issue that should not affect Macedonia's integration efforts. 
Bocevski said Malmstrom had assured him of Sweden's continued support on Macedonia's road to the EU.
Separately Monday, President Branko Crvenkovski discussed regional issues with US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Stuart Jones. 
Crvenkovski reiterated that Skopje remains committed to resolving the dispute with Greece. 
Jones said he hoped it happens soon, as Macedonia's accession to NATO would contribute to further stability and prosperity.

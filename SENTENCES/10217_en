ANKARA, Turkey -- The National Security Council met on Wednesday (27 October) to discuss issues related to the country's EU membership bid.
It is the first session the council has held with a civilian -- Mehmet Yigit Alpogan -- in the post of secretary general.
The council issued a special declaration calling on the Union to apply to Turkey the same criteria it applies to other candidates.
Also Wednesday, Turkish Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc declared that on 17 December "Europe would pass a democracy test" when it decides whether to start accession talks with Turkey.
His remark followed talks with visiting Portuguese counterpart Mota Amaral.

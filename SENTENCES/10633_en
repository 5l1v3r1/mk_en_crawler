THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of Slobodan Milosevic resumed Tuesday (12 October) with testimony from a German journalist who covered the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1998-1999. 
Franz-Josef Hutsch was questioned about the Racak massacre, in which 45 Kosovo Albanians were allegedly murdered by Serbian forces. 
He denied defence claims that the victims were combatants, saying that most were men over 50 and were not likely KLA recruits. 
Hutsch did say, however, that the KLA tried to persuade ethnic Albanians to leave their homes by spreading rumours of planned attacks.
In other news, former Bosnian Army security chief Lubisja Beara appeared before The Hague tribunal for the first time on Tuesday but did not enter a plea. 
He is charged with co-ordinating the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
Beara called on other indictees to surrender to the tribunal.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- In a joint announcement, President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks confirmed on Monday (October 8th) that general elections will take place on November 25th.
The last session of the current parliament will be held on Friday.
Also Monday, Mesic said he and others have received anonymous threats from Russia, warning him to stop insisting on the extradition of retired General Vladimir Zagorec, who is charged with embezzling Croatian defence funds.
The letters describe Zagorec as a patriot who "should be left alone".

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic insisted on Tuesday (December 29th) that authorities are capable of arresting former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.
In an interview with the RTS, Tadic stressed that Mladic should face international justice in The Hague for his role in the war in former Yugoslavia.
The president added that Tuesday's resignation of Rasim Ljajic as co-ordinator of the Action Team for locating and arresting the remaining fugitives is an act of political responsibility.

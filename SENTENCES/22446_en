BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Tuesday (October 14th) the EU would offer its expertise to help implement Union rules in the Turkish part of Cyprus, once the ongoing reunification talks progress.
Barroso and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias reached agreement on the initiative at their meeting in Brussels.
Protocol 10 of the EU Accession Treaty for Cyprus offers the basis for implementing the EU's legal provisions in the Turkish part within a future federation.

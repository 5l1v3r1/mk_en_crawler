ANKARA, Turkey -- Over 1,000 supporters of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party attacked the office of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the eastern Turkish town of Dogubayazit on Wednesday (July 18th), ahead of general elections this Sunday. 
Witnesses told the Dogan news agency that fighting first broke out between the nationalists and the Kurdish marchers, who were chanting in support of Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party. 
After the Kurdish marchers attacked the MHP office, police fired warning shots to disperse the crowd.
Late Tuesday, a percussion bomb exploded in front of an office affiliated with the ruling Justice and Development Party, causing some damage but no injuries. 
A few days ago, there were two similar blasts outside party offices in Izmir.

WASHINGTON, United States -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters on Thursday (24 July) that Turkey is studying a US request for troops in Iraq.
"We would like a decision as soon as possible, but that is a judgment for the Turkish government to make," Powell said after meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
According to Gul, the decision would be easier if the troops were sent with a UN or NATO mandate.
Ankara maintains that a UN resolution adopted in March is not applicable to this request, as it related to deployment only in northern Iraq.

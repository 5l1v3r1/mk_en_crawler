BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors from the National Anticorruption Department (DNA) filed corruption charges Tuesday (May 26th) against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, who is currently a member of parliament representing the Social Democratic Party. 
Nastase was charged with taking bribes and forging official documents in connection with acquiring his home, worth an estimated 1.5m euros. 
In March, parliament's lower house decided to allow prosecutors to launch a criminal investigation. 
All previous attempts to open legal proceedings against him on corruption charges failed due to procedural issues in the investigation.

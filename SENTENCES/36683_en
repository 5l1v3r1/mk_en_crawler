TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament approved a controversial property bill Thursday (29 July) with 69 votes in favour and six against. 
The opposition again boycotted the vote, rejecting a compromise offered by the ruling Socialist Party. 
The newly-approved law incorporates changes proposed by President Alfred Moisiu, who intervened following criticism of the first draft by the international community. 
Calls by the opposition to fully compensate those who lost property under the former communist regime and to make the head of the property commission a presidential appointee were rejected.

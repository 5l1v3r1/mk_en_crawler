SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak on Thursday (April 24th) said he hopes the BiH Economic and Social Council will finally be established in coming months, stressing its importance to the economy and to constructive dialogue among policymakers, employers and workers. 
He stressed that the three groups must interact "not simply as a courtesy" but should view one another as "a political and practical resource". 
Establishing such a council was among the commitments undertaken by the state and entity prime ministers in the Platform for Action endorsed in October 2007.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU and US envoys to Macedonia warned Tuesday (20 June) that recent incidents during the 5 July election campaign could affect the country's EU and NATO membership aspirations. 
EU member state ambassadors told Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski that the incidents do not foreshadow fair and democratic elections. 
US Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic, meanwhile, held talks with Ali Ahmeti and Arben Xhaferri, the leaders of the two major ethnic Albanian parties in Macedonia. 
She said the use of violence in the election campaign is unacceptable. 
Several clashes involving use of weapons between party followers sparked the international community reactions.

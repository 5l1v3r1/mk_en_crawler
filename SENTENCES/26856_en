BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has so far collected more than 300,000 signatures in support of early elections, SNS representative Nikola Selakovic said on Sunday (February 7th).
Selakovic expects to amass more than the one million signatures required.
"The government does not want new elections because they are aware that their popularity is falling off, but if they have any political responsibility, the ruling parties will not be able to ignore the demand," Selakovic said.
SNS leader Tomislav Nikolic said his party will seek an early vote to get the parliamentary representation it deserves.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers adopted a draft bill Friday (19 December) for amendments to the national anthem law.
The ministers proposed mandatory use of the anthem during oath-taking ceremonies for key posts in the armed forces and the judicial system.
The changes will introduce financial sanctions against those who show no respect to the national anthem.
The government plans to send the bill to parliament for approval by the end of the month.

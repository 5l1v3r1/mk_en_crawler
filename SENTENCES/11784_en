BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Hungarian Democratic Alliance of Romania's (UDMR) main council decided on Saturday (18 December) that the party would back the efforts of the National Liberal Party (PNL)-Democratic Party (PD) alliance, to form a parliamentary majority. 
Meanwhile, following a meeting of the PNL-PD board Saturday, President-elect Traian Basescu repeated a call to the Humanist Party (PUR) to join the alliance and said the invitation was valid for two weeks. 
Basescu's statement came amid reports that PUR has decided to retain its partnership with the Social Democratic Party.

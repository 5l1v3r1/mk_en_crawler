During his recent visit to Belgrade, Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary-General Terry Davis praised the programme that Serbia intends to enact when it takes over the chairmanship of the CoE's Committee of Ministers later this month.
In particular, Davis welcomed the government's plans to include the civil sector.
"It is an interesting aspect, which none of the countries has used so far, that the government included NGOs, so that it is a national and not only governmental programme," Davis said after reviewing the plan.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, he said Serbia's upcoming term of office is not only a challenge and responsibility for the country, but also an opportunity to demonstrate a leading position both in the region and in Europe.
Serbia takes up the chairmainshp on May 11th. 
The Council of Europe includes 46 states, representing 800 million people.
While in Belgrade, Davis took part in a meeting of the committee responsible for the preparation of Serbia's chairmanship. 
He met with President Boris Tadic, Draskovic, Kosovo Co-ordination Centre President Sanda Raskovic-Ivic and a parliamentary delegation.
Serbia is expected to ratify the Law on Prohibition of Human Trafficking as soon as possible and to adopt the Law on NGOs, Davis said. 
Two years ago, Serbia signed the convention on the fight against human trafficking, but it has not been ratified by Parliament.
Serbian Ambassador to the CoE Sladana Prica said the upcoming chairmanship is a chance for Serbia to improve its international image. 
"We will prove that Serbia, despite its problems, is a democratic European state," she said.

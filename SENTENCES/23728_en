BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia protested to the UN and NATO on Friday (January 23rd) against the newly established Kosovo Security Force (KSF), media reported.
In protest letters sent to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Serbian President Boris Tadic called the new Kosovo force "an illegal paramilitary formation" and said it should be disbanded.
"[The KSF's] existence and activities represent a direct threat to the peace and stability of the western Balkans," Tadic wrote.
The KSF, he added, was formed on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo, which was never adopted by the UN Security Council.

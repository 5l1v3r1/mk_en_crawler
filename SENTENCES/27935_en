BELGRADE, Serbia -- Russian authorities have informed the Serbian Justice Ministry that prominent tycoon Bogoljub Karic never sought political asylum or citizenship in Russia, ministry official Slobodan Homen said on Saturday (August 21st). 
Homen pointed out that based on this information, there is no obstacle to extradition if Karic is arrested in Russia. 
Serbian media reported last month that he had been granted political asylum in Russia and therefore cannot be extradited to Serbia. 
He faces charges there of tax evasion, mismanagement of millions of euros and money laundering, stemming from his former company, mobile phone operator Mobtel. 
He left the country shortly after an investigation began in 2006.

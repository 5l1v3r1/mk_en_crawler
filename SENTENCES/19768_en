NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish and Greek community leaders will hold separate meetings with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York, Cypriot media reported on Thursday (September 20th).
Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos will meet with Ban Ki-moon on Sunday, while the leader of the Cypriot Turkish community, Mehmet Ali Talat, will visit UN headquarters on October 16th.
The two leaders will probably meet with each other in October to discuss implementation of the so-called July 8th agreement, with an eye to improving the quality of life on the divided island.

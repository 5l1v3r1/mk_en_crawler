SKOPJE, Macedonia -- About 2,000 ethnic Albanians gathered in Skopje on Sunday (November 14th) to protest a population census scheduled for April.
The demonstration was called by the opposition New Democracy party, headed by Imer Selmani.
Demonstrators insist the census should be conducted in July to avoid, as they argued, "manipulation" of the number of Albanians in the country.
A summer census would allow those working abroad to return and participate in the process.
The government instead decided to hold it between April 1st and 15th.
The Ethnic Albanian junior coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration voiced concern over Sunday's protest.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Serbian magistrate left for The Hague on Tuesday (5 August) to question Slobodan Milosevic about the abduction and murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic in 2000.
Aleksandar Vujicic, a magistrate in the district court of Belgrade, is expected to meet Milosevic on Wednesday.
The body of the former president was found while police were investigating the murder of the late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic earlier this year.
The Socialist Party announced, meanwhile, that Milosevic would only agree to an interrogation in front of the media.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A former Bosnian Serb police officer appeared before the new BiH special war crimes court to plead innocent to charges of murder, torture and rape of Muslims during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Gojko Jankovic was the second war crimes suspect transferred from the UN tribunal to stand trial in BiH.
He is accused of taking part in raids on Muslim villages in the area of Foca early in the war, and of participating in the detention and execution of a number of civilians.
Jankovic is also charged with raping Muslim women, some as young as 12.
The defendant has denied the charges.

TIRANA, Albania -- The country's Central Election Commission (CEC) proposed on Wednesday (3 May) that the next local elections take place between 20 December and 20 January.
Acting CEC chairman Klement Zguri said the suggestion was submitted to President Alfred Moisiu, who, by law, must determine the exact date.
Zguri also urged the main parties to stop arguing and speed up implementation of electoral reforms, in line with international recommendations.

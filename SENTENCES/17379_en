SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 5,000 people gathered in downtown Sarajevo on Tuesday (February 27th) to protest a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which exonerated Serbia on charges of committing genocide during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
The "Justice for the Genocide Victims" event was organised by groups representing war victims' families and veterans.
They insist that Serbia and Montenegro must accept legal, political, material and moral responsibility for the Srebrenica genocide.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview with Dnevni Avaz Friday (April 20th), UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte denied that she had struck a secret deal with Belgrade to retain classified status for certain key documents.
Del Ponte said such claims were completely unfounded and stemmed from an insufficient understanding of tribunal processes.
The allegations were made by Geoffrey Nice, deputy prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic.
He said that unavailability of the documents had been a factor in a recent International Court of Justice ruling that acquitted Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide at Srebrenica.

TUZLA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard B. 
Myers said Tuesday (4 May) that US troops would remain in BiH after the EU takes over the military mission. 
Myers, who visited the SFOR base in Tuzla, said US troops would have two priority tasks in the future -- detention of war crimes suspects and combating terrorism.
Also Tuesday, the International Community's High Representative Paddy Ashdown assessed a progress report submitted last week by the Republika Srpska commission investigating the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre as relatively good. 
Ashdown had sharply criticised earlier efforts.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey voiced bitter disappointment Tuesday (June 26th) with the EU's decision to open only two new chapters in accession talks with Ankara.
"We are not satisfied with the technical justifications that were given to us and we hope that there will be progress in this matter" after Portugal takes over the bloc's rotating presidency, Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan said at a press conference.
He is also Ankara's chief negotiator with the EU.
He warned that both Turkey and the Union would suffer if the EU abandons its objective of accepting Turkey as a full member.
The implications for the EU could be global, Babacan said.
Negotiations on the economic and monetary policy chapter have been blocked by France, whose president, Nicolas Sarkozy, says he opposes EU membership for Turkey.
However, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the opening of talks in the areas of statistics and financial control proved that the process is essentially on track.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- The EBRD published its new country strategy for Croatia on Tuesday (15 March), following endorsement of the document by the EBRD board earlier this month. 
The Bank praised the political and economic stabilisation made under the coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, noting that the country has achieved its key objective of obtaining official EU candidate status. 
The Bank also indicated its readiness to continue supporting Croatia on the road to EU accession. 
The country strategy highlights infrastructure, small- and medium-sized businesses and tourism as the main investment priorities over the next two to three years.

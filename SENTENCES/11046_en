SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In a statement released Sunday (29 May), EU Police Mission chief Kevin Carty said that until the police system in BiH is fully reformed, it will be impossible to reach European standards in the sector.
Efficient restructuring requires the crossing of current entity borders, Carty said, adding that a proposed map of police regions was drafted on the basis of work by experts and that Republika Srpska (RS) lawmakers should support it.
On Monday, the RS Parliament was due to hold a session on the reform plans.
In other news, Principal Deputy High Representative Larry Butler said the uncertainty shown by BiH authorities towards reforms and EU integration represents the biggest obstacle to increased foreign investment in the country.
His comments appeared in Monday's edition of the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine.

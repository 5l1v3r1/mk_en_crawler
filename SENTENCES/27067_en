BUCHAREST, Romania -- Adrian Streinu-Cercel, state secretary at the Health Ministry, resigned on Tuesday (November 3rd) after President Traian Basescu described his statements about the spread of the H1N1 virus in Romania as "apocalyptic". 
Cercel's resignation came less than a month after he was appointed to the post. 
Media quoted him Tuesday as saying that the swine flu pandemic could last up to two years and could include four different waves of the virus. 
Cercel explained that "if there is one person who is actually ill, there are ten others who carry the virus", which potentially translates into thousands of deaths. 
Basescu called for calm Tuesday.

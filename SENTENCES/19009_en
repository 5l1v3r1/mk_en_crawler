THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The appeals chamber of the UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (April 2nd) upheld the 20-year prison term of confessed Bosnian Croat war criminal Miroslav Bralo.
The former member of a Bosnian Croat military police unit admitted to committing atrocities against Muslims in the Ahmici area in 1993.
He was sentenced in December 2005.
Bralo will remain in the tribunal's detention facility until a decision is made on where he should serve the remainder of his sentence.

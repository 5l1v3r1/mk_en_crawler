PARIS, France -- France supports Serbia's bid for EU candidate status, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said on Tuesday (January 4th) after meeting with French Minister for European Affairs Laurent Wauquiez in Paris. 
Wauquiez, however, stressed the importance of meeting all EU-set criteria. 
Djelic added he held talks with representatives of the Ministry for Foreign Trade to discuss conditions for strategic bilateral partnership on a project to build Belgrade's underground railway, a project he described as of "paramount importance" to the capital and the rest of Serbia.

ATHENS, Greece -- More than 2,000 Muslim immigrants participated in a demonstration in Athens against a police officer's alleged desecration of the Koran. 
The rally, held Friday (May 29th), was the second such protest. 
Last week, a policeman conducting a check in an Athens coffee shop reportedly seized a copy of the Koran from a customer, ripped it apart, threw it on the ground and stamped on it.
Friday's rally was organized by immigrant groups, anti-racist groups and human rights organisations. 
Dozens of police officers were deployed to prevent possible clashes with neo-Nazi protesters who were gathering for a separate demonstration. 
There were no incidents.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday (May 4th) that he has "reached the limits of his creativity" in efforts to settle the long-standing border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia.
In an interview with the Austrian newspaper Standart, Rehn said he expects the two countries to respond to his latest proposal for resolving the conflict by mid-May.
"I expect positive reactions to our compromise proposal ...
I hope the two countries will now get past the final kilometres and reach an agreement," Rehn was quoted as saying.
His proposal reportedly includes the establishment of an ad hoc arbitration panel consisting of EC representatives, one Croatian and one Slovenian.

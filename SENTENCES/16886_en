TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu called for a stronger, more independent judiciary, during a speech to a regional forum in Tirana on Wednesday (October 4th). 
He warned against continual political interference and attempts to influence judicial decisions.
On Thursday, the president again tried to get leaders of the 12 main parties to agree on a date for local elections this winter. 
The main opposition Socialist Party wants a postponement of the vote -- which by law must be held between December 20th and January 20th -- in light of the traditionally heavy snows that would affect turnout in mountainous areas.

ATHENS, Greece -- Buses and trolley buses in Athens grind to a halt on Friday (February 18th) due to a five-hour work stoppage by public transport workers.
They are protesting passage earlier this week of a law that reforms the debt-laden public transport system.
Workers fear that the bill, which envisions restructuring the sector to cut costs, will result in job losses and lower pay.

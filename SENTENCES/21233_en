LUXEMBOURG -- EU foreign ministers decided on Tuesday (April 29th) to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the first step towards EU membership, at their next meeting on May 26th.
Observers widely expected the decision since EU officials earlier said it would be impossible to translate all the necessary documents by Tuesday.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak called it good news for BiH, coming just two weeks after the adoption of long-awaited police reforms.
BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic, however, lashed out at the EU for providing Serbia a shortcut to accession.
He said it was illogical to allow Serbia to sign an SAA on Tuesday without meeting all accession criteria, whereas BiH, which fulfilled all criteria, had to wait.

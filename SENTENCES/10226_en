SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Draft solutions to the problems of overemployment and surplus arms in the defence sector should be ready by the end of the year, according to the defence ministry. 
Officials told the daily Dnevnik that 1,703 civil servants and 1,316 officers would be laid off or forced to take early retirement. 
Apart from the need to identify surplus weaponry by the end of 2004, the restructuring plan envisions the destruction of outdated army equipment by mid-2005.

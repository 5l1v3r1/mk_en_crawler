ANKARA, Turkey -- The jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, has proposed establishing an umbrella political party, free of any ethnically specific characteristics.
"This party will not depend on nationality," Ocalan was quoted as telling his lawyers Friday (May 27th).
He added that the organisation "will also be sensitive to nationalities and cultures in itself, and will be a roof organisation on the axis of labour." The PKK leader, who is serving a life prison sentence, suggested the organisation could start operating after the June 12th general elections.

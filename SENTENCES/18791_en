ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government and the EU sealed on a memorandum on social inclusion goals Monday (March 5th), a step that would lead eventually to full participation in EU policies in this field. 
In part, the accord, drafted jointly over the past 18 months, outlines the main challenges faced by Croatia in promoting social inclusion and modernising social protections. 
According to the government, it envisions measures to boost employment, improve the quality of healthcare and education, and promote gender equality.

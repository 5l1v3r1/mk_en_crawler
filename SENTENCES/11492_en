BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Establishing a joint police structure in BiH is the only way to ensure an efficient and responsible police, freed from political interference and control, according to EU Police Mission Commissioner Kevin Carty.
In an interview Sunday (20 February) with the Banja Luka-based daily Nezavisne novine, Carty warned of links between the administration and organised crime.
Moreover, he said, many war crimes indictees rely on support from organised crime.
Also Sunday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said he expects the issue of Serb ministers' resignations from the central government to be settled by the end of this week.
He again urged the Party for Democratic Progress representatives -- Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, Transport Minister Branko Dokic and Deputy Civil Affairs Minister Zoran Tesanovic -- to withdraw their resignations, tendered back in December in the wake of sanctions imposed against Republika Srpska.

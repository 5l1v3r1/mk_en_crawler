PODGORICA, Montenegro -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn confirmed that EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with Montenegro are expected to continue under a new mandate in September, during his visit to Podgorica on Friday (7 July). 
It was his first visit since the country became independent a month ago. 
The SAA negotiations would proceed from where they previously stopped, said Rehn, recalling that the dual-path model for talks with the former Serbia-Montenegro state union meant that a large number of topics were discussed with the republics separately.
Also Friday, Montenegro and Croatia officially established diplomatic ties. 
Croatia recognised Montenegro's independence on 12 June.
In other news, an explosives store exploded in Niksic, central Montenegro, very early Saturday. 
It injured 32 people, including 9 children, and damaged houses within a 2km radius.

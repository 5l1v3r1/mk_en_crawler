BAGHDAD, Iraq -- The Congress for Freedom and Democracy in Kurdistan (KADEK), a rebel group which has led a 15-year armed struggle for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, announced on Tuesday (11 November) that it was dissolving itself to form a new political organisation. 
The group, better known by its former name -- the Kurdistan Workers' Party -- said in a statement that the decision was made at a congress last month. 
KADEK, which is on a US State Department list of terrorist groups, said it will now focus on what it described as a "political struggle".

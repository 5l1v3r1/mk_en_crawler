PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Police plan to question Ratko Knezevic, former chief of the country's trade mission in Washington, over allegations he has made accusing high-ranking Montenegrin officials of cigarette smuggling. 
Police Director Veselin Veljovic told the Podgorica-based daily Dan on Sunday (August 23rd) that Knezevic needs to present evidence proving his allegations. 
Knezevic has said Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and Serbian businessman Stanko Subotic were both involved in the smuggling.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ailing patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Pavle, agreed on Thursday (November 13th) to remain at the helm of the institution after the Holy Synod refused to accept his resignation.
Pavle, 93, requested dismissal from the post earlier this month due to his poor health.
At its regular autumn session Tuesday, the synod refused to accept his resignation, asking him instead to remain in the post indefinitely.

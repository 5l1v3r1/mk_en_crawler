NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos and Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou met on Wednesday (10 September) to discuss possible solutions to the Cyprus dispute.
They focused on possible changes to the plan proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities both understand that the island's future lies with EU accession and have accepted the need to work together for that common goal, Papadopoulos said.

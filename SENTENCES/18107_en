BUCHAREST, Romania -- The US Embassy issued a statement Monday (May 14th) after Ambassador Nicholas Taubman met with Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the National Anticorruption Division, Doru Tulus.
In it, Taubman praised efforts by Tulus and other key anti-corruption prosecutors, as well as Chief Prosecutor Laura Kovesi.
The ambassador also stressed that it was essential for Bucharest to maintain credibility in terms of fighting corruption.
Last week, new Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu demanded the dismissal of Tulus, for alleged incompetence and inefficiency.

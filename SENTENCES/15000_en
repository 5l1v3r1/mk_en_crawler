PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Miroslav Lajcak, EU security chief Javier Solana's special envoy to Podgorica, acknowledged on Wednesday (1 February) some progress in political talks on the terms of Montenegro's independence referendum.
He noted, however, that negotiations between the ruling coalition and opposition are continuing and the outcome is not yet clear.
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic has called for an emergency session of parliament on 7 February to discuss the proposed split from the federal union with Serbia.
The referendum would likely be held in April.

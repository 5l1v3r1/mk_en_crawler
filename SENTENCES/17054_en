BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian authorities have found the bird flu virus in an owl that died in Constanta, officials reported Sunday (2 April). 
Romania's National Health-Veterinary Agency said teams have performed routine disinfection measures, but have not imposed quarantine on the busy area because they consider this an isolated case rather than an outbreak of the disease. 
Nearly 350,000 poultry from 15,000 farms have been culled since the discovery of Romania's first bird flu case on 7 October 2005.

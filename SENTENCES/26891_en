PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government has granted Serbian President Boris Tadic permission to visit the Decani Monastery in celebration of Orthodox Christmas on Thursday (January 7th).
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said on Tuesday that the visit will be of a religious character, adding "Tadic should not misuse this understanding ...
and make political statements." Tadic insists he can visit Kosovo without the permission or invitation of Kosovo institutions.
Local media reported that Tadic sought permission instead from international institutions in Kosovo.

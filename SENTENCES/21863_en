ANKARA, Turkey -- Interior Minister Besir Atalay announced on Wednesday (October 22nd) that Turkey will establish new institutions to co-ordinate the fight against terrorism.
They will include the Higher Internal Security Council, Internal Security General Secretariat and Border Security Under-Secretariat.
The move follows a series of attacks on Turkish military forces by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), including one last month that killed 17 soldiers.
Also Wednesday, clashes erupted at the funeral of a protester killed during a rally organised by the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party in the eastern province of Agri.
Ahmet Ozkan died on Monday in clashes with police in the town of Dogubeyazit during a protest in support of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Tension remains high in predominantly Kurdish provinces amid allegations Ocalan suffered mistreatment in prison.
Turkish authorities deny the claims.
In other news Wednesday, authorities said Turkish troops killed two PKK members in the southeastern province of Bingol.
Governor Irfan Balkanoglu says the fighting happened Tuesday near the village of Dallitepe.

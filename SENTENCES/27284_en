ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry issued a statement Tuesday(December 1st) expressing disappointment with a Swiss referendum to ban the building of new minarets, and urged Switzerland "to correct its mistake as soon as possible".
The statement described the decision as "an unfortunate development against basic humanitarian values and freedoms", adding "Cultural diversity, tolerance and respect basic human rights carry high importance." In a speech to the Turkish parliament, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday's vote demonstrates "the waves of racism and extreme nationalism overflowing Europe".
He urged European countries and institutions to act against this ban.
During an official visit to Jordan, Turkish President Abdullah Gul described the Swiss vote as "shameful" and a sign that "Islamophobia is expanding in Western Europe." Gul and Jordan's King Abdullah II signed a free trade agreement Tuesday aimed at boosting bilateral trade and investments, especially in the fields of transportation and energy.
The leaders also decided to scrap visa requirements for nationals from the two countries.

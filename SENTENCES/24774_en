SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Voters headed to the polls Sunday (July 5th) to fill the 240 seats in parliament, choosing from among more than 4,000 candidates.
Latest polls suggest Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov's Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) will win the majority of votes, but probably not enough to form a government outright.
The Bulgarian Socialist Party is expected to finish second, followed by an ethnic Turkish party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.
This election, the sixth since the end of communism in 1989, will be the first to employ a mixed system that combines majority voting with proportional representation.
Voters will use two ballot papers -- one with the names of the candidates for majority representation, and another one with the proportional lists of registered parties and coalitions.
Concerns about vote-buying and other irregularities have become a key issue in the lead-up to the poll.
On Saturday, Tadeusz Iwinski, head of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)'s delegation to Bulgaria, warned the country may lose its accreditation for PACE if serious problems mar the vote.

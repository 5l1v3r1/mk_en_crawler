ZAGREB, Croatia -- The special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, Erhard Busek, told Austrian media Saturday (26 February) that he doubts that Croatia will fulfil the requirement for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal by 17 March -- the date accession talks are scheduled to start with the EU.
Brussels has repeatedly warned that not meeting the requirement could throw the start of talks into jeopardy.
The major sticking point is Zagreb's failure to apprehend and extradite retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the tribunal's most-wanted suspects.
Zagreb media, meanwhile, has quoted Croatian Foreign and EU Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as suggesting the prospects for launching negotiations have deteriorated.
She and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader reportedly told parliamentary leaders that authorities are taking steps to locate Gotovina, but cautioned against exaggerated optimism about the start of talks.

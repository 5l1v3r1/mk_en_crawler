STRASBOURG, France -- The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a report Tuesday (September 30th) on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)'s progress in efforts to fulfil EU membership criteria. 
Also adopted was a resolution calling for stronger state-level institutions and constitutional reforms. 
The report, prepared by Finland's Kimmo Sasi and Turkey's Mevlut Cavusoglu, earlier won unanimous approval by the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly.
In other news Tuesday, Spanish Defence Minister Carme Chacon said she will lobby other EU members -- during a meeting in Touville, France, later this week -- to make the EU military mission in BiH an "essentially civil" mission. 
She told a senate committee in Madrid that the transfer of responsibilities to the BiH Army is basically complete; the only task left to do is to finalise political reforms.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Tuesday (21 January), US envoy for war crimes Pierre-Richard Prosper warned that the United States could block aid for Yugoslavia if it fails to arrest three war crimes suspects believed to be hiding on its territory:
Gen Ratko Mladic, Maj Veselin Sljivancanin and Col Miroslav Radic.
The three were indicted for their roles in the 1991-1995 conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After a meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Prosper added that the delay in arresting the fugitives also jeopardises plans to close the UN war crimes tribunal in 2008.
Djindjic reiterated his government's claim that it does not know their whereabouts.
In separate news, former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic will appear before the war crimes tribunal on Monday to enter a plea to five charges of crimes against humanity.
He met with chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who says he has agreed to talk with investigators.

WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. 
Bush pressed on Monday (17 October) for the release of five Bulgarian nurses sent to death row in Libya on charges that they deliberately spread HIV among children. 
"There should be no confusion in the Libyan government's mind -- that those nurses ought to be not only spared their life, but be out of prison," Bush said after a meeting with Bulgarian counterpart Georgi Parvanov. 
International experts have concluded that poor sanitary conditions and equipment, not the nurses, were to blame for the HIV epidemic at a Benghazi hospital.
Separately, Bush praised Bulgaria's recent election process in as an example of democracy. 
And Bulgarian Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov, a member of the delegation accompanying Parvanov, said Sofia and Washington have agreed on most issues related to the location of US military bases in Bulgaria.

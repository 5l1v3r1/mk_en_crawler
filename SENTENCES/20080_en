BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament rejected on Monday (March 17th) an initiative by the Bosniak and Croat Presidency members -- Haris Silajdzic and Zeljko Komsic -- proposing that the UN store the war crimes tribunal's archives in BiH.
Serb Presidency member Nebojsa Radmanovic first vetoed the proposal about ten days ago, voicing concerns that transferring the archives to BiH could undermine RS and Serbian interests.
The decision on where the archives will be stored after the tribunal shuts down lies ultimately with the UN Security Council.

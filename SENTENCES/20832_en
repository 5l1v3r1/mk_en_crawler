TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament approved on Monday (November 5th) a report by an investigative commission requesting the removal of General Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, for suspected ties to organised criminal gangs. 
Critics say he failed to act on an estimated 200 cases -- arrests or extradition requests -- sought by courts in other European countries. 
Now that the report has been approved, President Bamir Topi can either accept or reject parliament's decision.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police are searching for five oil paintings by Croatian painter Vlaho Bukovac in former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's art collection, the interior ministry announced on Wednesday (January 26th).
The valuable paintings did not turn up during recent searches of his home and office.
They allegedly went missing in December.
Goran Suic, one of Sanader's lawyers, rejected media allegations that his client hid the paintings.
Authorities blocked Sanader's assets and confiscated his art collection as part of an ongoing investigation against him for abuse of power.
He remains in custody in Austria, where he was detained on December 10th.

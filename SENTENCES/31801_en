NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has turned down the six-point reconciliation proposal offered by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash. 
In a letter to Denktash sent on Thursday (3 April), Papadopoulos reportedly said negotiations to settle the dispute over the island division could occur only under the auspices of the UN. 
He also criticised Denktash for contributing to the failure of negotiations last month in The Hague. 
A spokesman for Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer urged the Greek Cypriot government to reconsider.

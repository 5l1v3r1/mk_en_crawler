SINGAPORE, Singapore -- A witness on Monday (March 8th) identified a Romanian diplomat assigned to Singapore as the driver responsible for two hit-and-run accidents that left one person dead and two injured in December.
Mohamed Noor testified at a coroner's inquiry that Silviu Ionescu, 49, was driving the embassy car that caused the incidents.
Ionescu insists the vehicle had been stolen.
Dismissed from his post, he faces criminal charges in Romania in connection with the case.

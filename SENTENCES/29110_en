BUCHAREST, Romania -- Dozens of Roma protested in several cities across the country Monday (September 6th) against France's repatriation policy regarding their community. 
In Bucharest, around 60 young Roma gathered in front of the French Embassy carrying banners reading "Stop Sarkozy, stop expulsions" and "Roma are European citizens". 
In Timisoara, around 40 Roma protested in front of the French Cultural Centre. 
In the northwest city of Cluj and Petrosani in the west, there were about 20 demonstrators. 
Their numbers were smaller than expected by organisers who said they had urged "only activists to join the demonstrations".

ZAGREB, Croatia -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso did not provide a possible date to finalise EU negotiations with Croatia.
Speaking at a Zagreb press conference after meeting with Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor on Thursday (April 7th), Barroso said the country should focus efforts on judicial reforms, fundamental rights and fighting corruption, noting the EC wants to see concrete and sustainable results in these areas.
Despite praising efforts of the Kosor-led cabinet to fulfil criteria for completing the talks, Barroso said the end of June target is "very challenging and ambitious".
Barroso heads to Sarajevo on Friday to meet with members of the presidency.
They'll discuss key issues in relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU, as well necessary reforms.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele will be there, as will Stefano Sannino, deputy director-general of the EU's Directorate-General for External Relations, and Miroslav Lajcak, EU managing director for Europe and Central Asia.

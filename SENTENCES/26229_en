BELGRADE, Serbia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele on Wednesday (March 17th) voiced the European Commission's (EC) support for Serbia's EU integration.
After talks with Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic in Belgrade, Fuele said that while Serbia faces a lot of challenges and tasks, the EC is ready to help if Belgrade is truly determined.
Fuele added Serbia should maintain the positive momentum achieved late last year.
As for Kosovo, Cvetkovic urged the bloc to come up with a technical solution so that Pristina's participation in international meetings is status-neutral.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX has established a special police unit in charge of northern Kosovo, the mission's spokesperson Hanns-Christian Klasing told Tanjug news agency on Tuesday (January 4th). 
The unit, formed in November, is still looking for recruits, including prosecutors and custom officers. 
It was established in view of stepped up efforts to fight organised crime in this Serb-dominated part of Kosovo.

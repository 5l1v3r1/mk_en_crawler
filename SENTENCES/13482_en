WASHINGTON, United States -- Former President Bill Clinton urged the authorities of Republika Srpska to speed up efforts to bring indicted war criminals to justice. 
"Without the arrest and transfer of all indicted war criminals, especially Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, justice will not have been done and the Balkans will be unable to leave the past behind them," Clinton wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday (23 November). 
He praised Tuesday's agreement among top political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina on constitutional reform that would streamline the country's administration.
In other news, new research suggests the actual death toll of the BiH conflict was half the current estimate of 200,000.

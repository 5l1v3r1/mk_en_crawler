BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said Thursday (30 June) that all security agencies are engaged in the manhunt for Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, adding that the government is fully committed to capturing the fugitive and extraditing him to The Hague.
Stojkovic also denied that the government is negotiating Mladic's surrender, as several recent reports had suggested.
Former Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic confirmed this week that his ministry knew the exact location of Mladic until the middle of 2002.
According to Mihajlovic, the army was protecting Mladic, and any arrest attempt would have resulted in a direct confrontation between the police and army.

MITROVICA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A UNMIK police officer was shot dead Sunday night (3 August) on the Zvecan railway bridge near Mitrovica. 
B92 Radio reports that the officer was likely killed in a UN police patrol ambush.
Meanwhile, Albanian-language media in Pristina are reporting that relations between Kosovo officials and UNMIK are deteriorating. 
The strain in relations was reportedly set off by remarks made late last week by Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Jakup Krasniqi, who expressed disapproval of UNMIK's work.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's Deputy Prime Minister Adriean Videanu resigned Friday (18 March), in order to run for mayor of Bucharest on the ticket of the ruling National Liberal Party-Democratic Party alliance.
Videanu's withdrawal came a day before the campaign for the 3 April mayoral vote officially kicked off.
Later on Friday, the Democrats said they have suggested to Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu that he appoint Gheorghe Seculici as Videanu's successor.

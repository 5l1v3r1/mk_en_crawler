ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc said Thursday (3 February) that he is hopeful about France's referendum on Turkey's EU membership bid.
Arinc met the president of the French National Assembly, Jean Louis Debre, in Ankara and said Turkey would work to boost ties with France before the French cast their votes.
Debre said the issue is very important and that there should be active dialogue to resolve differences.
Also Thursday, local media reported that Turkish police had discovered a 5kg bomb in a nightclub close to Incirlik Air Force base, which is being used by the US military for troop rotations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Police are looking for two suspects.

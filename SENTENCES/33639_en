MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Croat ministers in the BiH Federation government left the cabinet session held in Mostar on Thursday (11 September) in protest of the bill on veterans.
They say the constitutional procedure went unobserved during the first vote and noted possible problems related to the financing of benefits covered under the measure.
According to the draft law, the budget would allocate 160m euros to support veterans and their families.

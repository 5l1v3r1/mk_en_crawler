SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The OSCE Ambassador to Macedonia, Carlos Pais, says he does not expect any incidents during the 5 July parliamentary elections. 
In an interview with the local A1 TV on Sunday (11 June), he noted that efforts by state authorities, as well as the encouraging signals elsewhere in the region -- including the successful referendum in Montenegro last month and the local elections in Southern Serbia last week -- bode well for a free, fair and democratic vote in Macedonia, a major requirement for eventual EU accession.
On Friday, parliament adopted changes to the Penal Code, related to the electoral process. 
The new provisions envision stiffer penalties for election violations, including jail time in addition to fines.

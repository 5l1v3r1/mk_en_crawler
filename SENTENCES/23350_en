PRISTINA, Kosovo -- As requested, UNMIK has handed a file over to Serbian prosecutors related to an organ trafficking case, local media reported on Monday (March 30th).
Investigators are running down information on organ trafficking that allegedly victimised Serbs in 1999.
According to the office of Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic, UNMIK officials delivered the file on Sunday.
Serb media refer to the case as the "yellow file", as Serb prosecutors say the Kosovo Liberation Army removed the organs of Serb hostages in a house painted yellow in northern Albania.
An unnamed UNMIK official quoted by the media said the file consists of five pages but contains no concrete evidence.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A group of Iraqis ended their six-day protest at a British military base in northern Cyprus on Monday (January 14th).
The six men, who were perched atop a 14m-high fire service tower, threatened to throw themselves off unless they were given British passports.
They say the British had initially promised to issue them the documents, but later told them to apply for asylum in the Republic of Cyprus.
While a base spokesman said the six agreed to leave the tower and submit applications in Cyprus, media reports suggest it was because they were starving.

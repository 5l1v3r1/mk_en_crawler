NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police arrested a Romanian man Sunday (March 21st), suspected of vandalising the tombs of three Cypriot archbishops.
The suspect admits removing marble plaques from the graves of Sofronios III, Kyrillos II and Kyrillos III.
Police say the suspect has been involved in similar incidents in the past and has a "problem with the church and holy places".
Archbishop Chrysostomos II condemned the vandalism and urged authorities to strengthen security around cemeteries.

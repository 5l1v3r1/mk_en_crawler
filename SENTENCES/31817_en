SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following the Orao arms trading scandal and the revelation of espionage activities by the Republika Srpska (RS) Army, High Representative Paddy Ashdown has moved to place the military in BiH under effective civilian control. 
On Wednesday (2 April), he announced a decision to dissolve the RS Supreme Defence Council; army command would be provisionally transferred to the RS President. 
Ashdown also decided on amendments to the RS Constitution, the RS law on the army and the RS and Federation of BiH laws on defence. 
The Office of the High Representative, together with the OSCE, are to form a commission to work on constitutional and legal reforms resulting in effective state-level command and control.

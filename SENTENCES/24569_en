TIRANA, Albania -- US Ambassador to Albania John Withers called on authorities on Wednesday (May 6th) to better protect prosecutors from political pressure and let them do their job according to the law. 
"Every threat to their independence marks a step back; therefore, there should not be any political pressure on the prosecution," Withers said. 
Last week, USAID published a report on corruption that urged Albania to boost efforts aimed at improving the situation in the field.

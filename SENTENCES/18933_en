BELGRADE, Serbia -- An elderly Serb family in the Medvedja village of Velika Braina, situated just on the administrative line with Kosovo, was attacked on Tuesday (April 3rd) by a group of ethnic Albanians coming from the Kosovo side, according to Serbian media. 
The three assailants reportedly beat 74-year old Branislav Zdravkovic and his sister, Draguna Cvetkovic, before stealing their livestock.
Rasim Ljajic, head of the government co-ordination body for Southern Serbia, condemned the incident and demanded that UNMIK police and KFOR tighten security in the administrative zone.

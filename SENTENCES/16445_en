ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court decided on Tuesday (11 April) to drop charges against four journalists in a high-profile case that has been scrutinised by the European Commission.
A fifth journalist will face trial, however.
The five were indicted in December for criticising a court decision to block an international conference on the killings of Armenians during World War I, events referred to by many as genocide.
The court cited the statute of limitations when dismissing the charges.
Murat Belge will go to trial, however, because his article was published later.
In other news, a court began hearings in a case against Turkey's best-known novelist Orhan Pamuk.
He is being sued by six nationalists seeking compensation from the writer because of what they describe as his insult to the Turkish nation.
Pamuk said in an interview that thousands of Armenians and Kurds have been killed in Turkey over the years.

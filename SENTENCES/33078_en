SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR Commander Lt Gen William Ward has suggested a model for reform of BiH's armed forces, according to SFOR spokesman Dale MacEachern. 
He said Tuesday (20 May) that Ward sent a letter to the two entities' ministers of defence and army commanders, proposing that the structure of the armed forces be based on command and control at the state level, with one chain of command. 
It would go from the BiH presidency through the standing committee for military matters, and then to the armed forces' commanders. 
Ward also said that BiH could not afford to maintain more than 12,000 troops.

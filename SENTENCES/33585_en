ATHENS, Greece -- Government spokesman Christos Protopappas said Tuesday (16 September) that Greece is interested in a permanent solution to the name dispute with Macedonia.
He added that while new facts are being considered, this does not mean Greece is ready to compromise.
Athens refuses to recognise Macedonia's constitutional name for historical reasons.
Because of this, the name is not recognised internationally either.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer met with Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski on Monday (12 June) in Skopje, telling him that the 5 July parliamentary elections will be the most significant test of Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic prospects.
The elections should be "110 per cent free, peaceful and fair", said de Hoop Scheffer, adding he is confident the country would succeed in this goal.
On Tuesday, meanwhile, some 30 Macedonian political parties were due to sign a Code on Free and Fair Elections.
It aims to ensure calm and democratic elections and reduce the number of irregularities and violations.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Voters went to the polls Sunday (12 December) for the presidential runoff, pitting Prime Minister Adrian Nastase of the ruling Social Democratic Party against Bucharest Mayor Traian Basescu, who heads the opposition rightwing alliance. 
An estimated 3,300 independent observers are monitoring the vote following allegations of fraud in the first round two weeks ago. 
The Electoral Commission imposed stricter rules to prevent voters from casting ballots more than once. 
Polls give Nastase the edge, but this could be reversed if turnout is massive in urban areas where support for the opposition is strong. 
The winner receives a five-year mandate.

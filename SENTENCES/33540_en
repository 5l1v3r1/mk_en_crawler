TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu is urging state institutions participating in the election process to adhere closely to the constitution. 
Meeting Friday (19 September) with Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the president also called on political parties to observe the law and avoid confrontation at all costs. 
He particularly stressed the need for consensus on several issues related to next month's local elections, especially differences over the makeup of the Central Electoral Commission. 
Noting that the election law was amended through the consensus of political parties, Moisiu said this should continue to be the case.

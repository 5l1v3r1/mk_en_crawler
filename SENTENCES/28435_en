ATHENS, Greece -- Leftist organisations, students' associations and labour union representatives protested outside the parliament building in Athens late Monday (November 15th) against a memorandum between the government and the EU/IMF on the 110 billion-euro bailout package aimed to help Greece overcome its financial crisis.
Clashes between police and a group of young people broke out at the end of the protest, injuring one person.
Two demonstrations were also held in Thessaloniki.
The protestors criticised the memorandum and the arrival of a mission from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF earlier in the day.
They are there to assess implementation of the budgetary and other government measures to stabilise the economy.

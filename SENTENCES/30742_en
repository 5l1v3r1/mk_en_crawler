BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Eurozone leaders have decided to lower the interest rate of a 110 billion-euro bailout loan that the EU, European Central Bank and the IMF extended to Greece in May 2010, EU President Herman van Rompuy said on Saturday (March 12th). 
The loan was first extended at a punitive interest rate of 5.2% to discourage other countries experiencing financial difficulties from seeking similar assistance. 
On Friday, leaders of countries using the common European currency decided to cut the rate by 1% to 4.2% and extend the maturity from three to seven and a half years. 
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said the two moves would help Greece save around 6 billion euros.

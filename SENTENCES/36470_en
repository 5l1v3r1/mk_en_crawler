BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The European Commission reportedly is prepared to continue co-operating with Serbia-Montenegro on a feasibility study about signing an EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement, Serbian media quoted EU External Relations Commissioner Chief Chris Patten as saying during meetings in Belgrade on Wednesday (12 May).
However, Patten reportedly said more progress is needed on two fronts:
war crimes co-operation and establishment of a common market by Serbia and Montenegro.
In other news, Washington is offering to help curb weapons smuggling in Montenegro.
Though details were not released, the plan proposed Wednesday would be implemented simultaneously in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat approved on Monday (May 4th) the new government formed by the National Unity Party (UBP), after parliamentary elections in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on April 19th. 
UBP leader Dervis Eroglu is the new prime minister. 
The cabinet consists of 11 ministers, including Huseyin Ozgurgun as foreign minister, Ilkay Kamil as interior and local administration minister, and Ersin Tatar as finance minister. 
The right-wing conservative UBP won 44% of the vote, besting Talat's left-wing Republican Turkish Party.
In other news Monday, Cypriot media reported that the European People's Party (EPP), a party in the European Parliament, has called on Turkey to withdraw its troops from northern Cyprus and allow leaders of the two Cypriot communities to freely negotiate their country's future. 
Wrapping up a party congress in Warsaw at the weekend, the EPP urged Ankara to "facilitate a suitable climate for negotiations by withdrawing Turkish forces".

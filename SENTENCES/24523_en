ANKARA, Turkey -- The prosecutor's office said on Tuesday (June 9th) it has asked the justice ministry to dismiss a fraud case against President Abdullah Gul, over missing party funds, media reported.
Last month, a court in Ankara ruled Gul should stand trial for embezzlement despite his immunity as a head of state.
In a statement, the prosecutor's office said that the ruling violated both legal procedures and state laws.
Though the justice ministry can bring the case before the Supreme Court of Appeals, the recommendation by the prosecutor's office will boost chances that the case against Gul be dropped.
The case dates back to the late 1990s, when the Welfare Party, a predecessor to the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), allegedly embezzled millions of dollars of state funds.
Later, Gul and other party members left the Welfare Party to establish the AKP.
He was elected president in 2007.

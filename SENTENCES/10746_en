SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian Serb report acknowledged that the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 was planned, a senior international official said Monday (8 November). 
"The report itself admits and provides details of the plan and deliberate liquidation of thousands", said Bernard Fassier, deputy to BiH's top international administrator, Paddy Ashdown. 
The document, which has not been published, also lists the names of 7,800 victims, a figure which falls in line with estimates.
In other news Monday, the BiH Constitutional Court's Human Rights Commission sent a letter to RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic, generally endorsing the report. 
The constitutional panel also noted that the RS authorities extended for the first time a sincere apology to the survivors of Srebrenica.

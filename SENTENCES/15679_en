BUCHAREST, Romania -- Three judicial institutions, the Prosecutor's Office, the Supreme Court and the National Anticorruption Department, confirmed on Thursday (November 23rd) that they have launched separate investigations into energy sector privatisation, particularly the sale of the state oil and gas firm Petrom. 
Mediafax agency cites its own judicial sources who say nine people --Romanian officials and foreign consultants -- face charges of threatening national interests. 
Earlier this week, President Traian Basescu urged the holders of these privatisation contracts to make them public, in light of growing concerns.

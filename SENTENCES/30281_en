ANKARA, Turkey/NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Hundreds of activists in Turkey and Cyprus attended demonstrations Saturday (March 19th) against Ankara's plans to build nuclear power facilities.
Late last week, Turkey stated it remains firmly behind plans to build two nuclear power plants over the next 12 years --one near the town of Sinop on the Black Sea coast and a second one at Akkuyu, 25km from a seismic fault line.
Protestors in Istanbul and Mersin marched with banners reading "Don't let Akkuyu become Fukushima", referring to the critical situation at the Japanese nuclear plant after the disastrous earthquake ten days ago.
In Cyprus, about 50 Greek and Turkish Cypriots protested by wearing masks and white overalls.
On Friday, Greece urged Turkey to abandon its plans to build the nuclear facilities.
President Karolos Papoulias said that the EU should intervene to prevent a "catastrophe at its threshold".

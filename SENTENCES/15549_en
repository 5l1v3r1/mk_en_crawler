ZAGREB, Croatia -- A prominent lawmaker was arrested for war crimes on Thursday (October 26th), shortly after a parliamentary committee lifted his immunity from prosecution.
Branimir Glavas was accused of ordering the murder and torture of Serbs in Osijek during the 1991 conflict.
Prosecutors are investigating him in connection with two separate incidents.
Glavas denies the charges, accusing the government, prosecutors and the police of fabricating allegations.
He was expelled from the ruling Croatian Democratic Union after a dispute with Prime Minister Ivo Sanader last year.
He became an independent and then formed his own party that saw some success in the last local elections.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has accepted the financial part of a package of measures that the European Commission announced in support of the economy of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but has rejected the trade measures, according to EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter Verheugen. 
Wrapping up a three-day visit to the divided island Wednesday (18 June), Verheugen said the EU would prefer to accept a united Cyprus in May 2004. 
He urged the two communities to re-open talks on the UN-proposed peace plan.

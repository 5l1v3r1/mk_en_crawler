SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Administrators of the local internet site svevijesti.ba said on Sunday (September 21st) they received death threats after urging visitors to report corruption in the country's higher education system.
Last week, Croatian police arrested 90 people, including 21 professors from Zagreb University, as part of an operation against corruption. 
In its last annual report on enlargement at the end of 2007, the European Commission said corruption is widespread and deep-rooted in Balkan countries that want to join the EU.

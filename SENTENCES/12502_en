SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister-designate Vlado Buckovski is expected to present his list of new cabinet members Thursday (9 December), according to an announcement by the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM).
The daily Utrinski Vesnik, however, reported that Buckovski and Ali Ahmeti, the leader of the junior government partner, Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), are still at odds over the reappointment of DUI member Agron Buxhaku as head of the transport and telecommunications ministry.
Former Prime Minister Hari Kostov has accused him of corruption.

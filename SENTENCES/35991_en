SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Ministry spokesman Marjan Gjurovski said Tuesday (6 January) that Macedonia will get rid of its outdated military equipment, as required by NATO, during the first half of the year.
The army plans to scrap 60 T-55 tanks and destroy its SU-25 aircraft.
At the same time the ministry would buy one transport airplane and several helicopters, and would continue to modernise its MI-17 and MI-24 helicopters.
As for the budget intended for equipment modernisation, an issue of concern to NATO, Gjurovski said the current 5 per cent would be raised to 14 per cent.

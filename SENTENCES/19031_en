BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (May 2nd) to approve an agreement that would allow the United States to deploy up to 3,000 troops on four Romanian military bases. 
The ten-year agreement was signed in December 2005. 
In his address to lawmakers, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu stressed the broad public support for the presence of US troops in the country.
Also Wednesday, suspended President Traian Basescu said that if he loses a referendum on impeachment later this month, he will leave politics. 
Parliament cleared the way for the referendum last week, amid allegations Basescu had violated the constitution.

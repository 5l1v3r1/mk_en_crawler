SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of prosecution offices in Albania, BiH, Montenegro, Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia agreed on Monday (March 5th) in Sarajevo to unify efforts to fight organised crime. 
In his opening speech at the forum, BiH Chief Prosecutor Marinko Jurcevic said the present level of co-operation is good and has yielded results.

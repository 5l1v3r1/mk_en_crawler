THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The war crimes trial of three former KLA members started in The Hague on Monday (15 November).
Fatmir Limaj, 33, Haradin Bala, 57, and Isak Musliu, 34, are charged with murder, torture and inhumane acts allegedly committed against Serb and Albanian civilians in 1998.
"No cause, however just, justifies murder," prosecutor Andrew Cayley said in his opening statement.
He told the court that a series of witnesses would be called to prove the existence of a KLA prison camp where the atrocities allegedly took place.
The three defendants deny that there was such a facility in Lapusnik.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country plans to speed up deportation procedures and return those stripped of citizenship to their home countries as soon as possible, BiH Foreigners Service director Dragan Mektic was quoted as saying on Monday (March 17th) in Nezavisne Novine newspaper. 
He added that a new law on citizenship and refugee status is now in parliament and will considerably shorten the time frame between an appeal being filed regarding a deportation decision and a court ruling on that appeal. 
This would harmonise BiH practises related to migration and residency in BiH with those of the EU, a major requirement for liberalising the visa regime with the Union.
Last year, BiH stripped more than 660 people of Bosnian citizenship. 
Most were Muslims of Arab origin who BiH authorities said pose a threat to national security. 
Several have been deported while the others remain in BiH until their lengthy appeal procedures conclude.

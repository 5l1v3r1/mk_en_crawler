SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling criticised on Wednesday (22 March) those who question the legitimacy of the BiH police reform directorate.
The comment came a day after Milorad Dodik, Republika Srpska's (RS) new prime minister, said that last year's political agreement on police reform was violated by the inclusion of a foreign citizen as a member of the directorate's managing board.
Dodik also expressed dissatisfaction with the composition of the panel.
Schwarz-Schilling warned that attacking its legitimacy would only delay the implementation of the directorate's work, which is key to BiH's integration in EU structures.
In other news Wednesday, the BiH Presidency began drafting amendments to the constitution, following last week's political agreement on reforms aimed at strengthening state institutions.
The bill would be forwarded to the BiH Council of Ministers and the BiH Parliament.

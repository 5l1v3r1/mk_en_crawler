ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police arrested several former and current officials of the state-controlled highway company HAC on Thursday (November 26th). 
Among the five detained are Jurica Prskalo, the recently dismissed CEO of the company, and Mario Lovrincevic, former member of the management board. 
Media reports suggest the five are suspected of participating in a scheme that caused 3m euros in losses to the state budget. 
Authorities reportedly significantly overpaid for the painting of two tunnels on a key highway linking Zagreb with Split.

NEW YORK, United States -- A UN official said on Tuesday (August 24th) that Israel has blocked members of a panel investigating the deadly May 31st Israeli raid on a Turkish-led Gaza-bound aid flotilla from speaking with Israeli soldiers.
Juan Carlos Monge is a member of the UN Human Rights Council panel investigating the incident that left nine people dead.
He says that its three members have been denied entry to Israel to question local officials and witnesses.
The fact-finding team began a two-week visit to Turkey and Jordan on Monday.
Its inquiry is separate from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's panel that is investigating the incident.
Israel is conducting two investigations -- one by the military and one by an independent panel -- while Turkey has launched an investigation of its own.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government issued an urgent decree Wednesday (February 6th), re-allowing access to the archives of the Securitate, the communist-era secret police.
The decree came days after the country's Constitutional Court blocked the activity of the local agency charged with researching the archives.
"The decree was necessary because 18 years after the fall of the communist regime, we cannot stop our efforts midway to reveal the crimes of communism," Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said on Wednesday.

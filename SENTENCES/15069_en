BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU expects concrete results from the fight against organised crime in Bulgaria, as well as accelerated judicial reforms, said Austrian State Secretary Hans Winkler, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
During a meeting of the EU Council in Brussels on Tuesday (31 January), Winkler voiced hopes that Bulgaria would meet all membership criteria in time to join the EU in January 2007 as scheduled.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin attended the meeting and said EU officials are insisting on the complete removal of immunity for magistrates and members of parliament, as a means of fighting corruption.

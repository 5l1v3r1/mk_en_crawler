ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministry reacted sharply Monday (November 10th) to a statement by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who alleged Serbs in Croatia have been victims of ethnic cleansing.
Croatia will not allow any manipulation of facts or falsification of recent Croatian history regarding wars in the former Yugoslavia, Croatia's Foreign Ministry said.
Jeremic urged Croatia to give up a lawsuit it initiated at the International Court of Justice charging Serbia with genocide.
"We should bear in mind that Croatia is the country that carried out ethnic cleansing of the Serbian population on its territory.
Serbia did not do this.
Whoever lived in Serbia in the 1990s continues to live there today.
This is not so in Croatia.
There was ethnic cleansing of 250,000 people because they were Serbs," Jeremic told the Tanjug news agency.

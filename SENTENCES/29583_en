BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic attends a briefing Tuesday (May 31st) in Brussels for visa experts from missions of EU member states. 
On Monday, he met with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom to discuss visa issues. 
After the talks, he reiterated that the EU's visa free regime for Serbia is not at risk at the moment, and he voiced determination to continue implementing measures aimed at preventing visa abuses. 
Last week, the European Commission (EC) proposed the introduction of a safeguard clause that would allow for the temporary reintroduction of visas for citizens of a third country. 
The mechanism would be applied under certain exceptional conditions and as a last resort. 
The EC is talking to authorities in Serbia and Macedonia to find ways to reduce the number of asylum seekers.

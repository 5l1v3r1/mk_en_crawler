WASHINGTON, United States -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met on Friday (September 25th) with US President Barack Obama, on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh.
The two leaders discussed problems in the Middle East and Turkey, as well as relations among Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Obama stressing the importance of improved Ankara-Yerevan ties for the region as a whole.
For his part, Erdogan said things would be easier if the OSCE's Minsk Group -- tasked to find a solution to the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh -- took more active measures.

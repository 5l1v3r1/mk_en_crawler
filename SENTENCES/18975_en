ANKARA, Turkey -- A plan to unite two centre-right parties -- the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the True Path Party (DYP) -- has collapsed, ANAP leader Erkan Mumcu confirmed Sunday (June 3rd).
ANAP, which held its congress at the weekend, failed to approve the decision to abolish the party and join the Democratic Party (DP), which was formed last week by DYP.
The alliance was perceived as critical, since neither party was seen as likely to pass the parliamentary threshold on its own.

ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament decided on Thursday (April 28th) to establish an inquiry committee to investigate former Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos for bribery. 
He is suspected of having received kickbacks stemming from a controversial contract to purchase four German submarines for the Navy a decade ago. 
Thursday's proposal was backed by 226 lawmakers, while nine voted against it. 
During the debate Tsohatzopoulos denied any wrongdoing. 
He is a founding member of the ruling PASOK but was ousted from the party last year.

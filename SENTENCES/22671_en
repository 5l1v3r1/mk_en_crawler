SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) police staged another round of raids early Thursday (May 8th) at the homes of suspected supporters of war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic. 
Police searched the homes of Borisa Baricanin and Dusko Mihajlovic in the town of Pale, east of Sarajevo. 
Both men served as Karadzic's bodyguards during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Police looked for materials or other information regarding his whereabouts. 
He has been on the run since 1995 when the UN war crimes tribunal indicted him for the Srebrenica genocide and other war crimes.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Top political officials issued a statement on Thursday (26 July) pledging to continue with the democratic reforms that would eventually lead to EU integration.
The National Security Council, which is the top policy-making body consisting of political and military leaders, urged the Union to open accession talks with Turkey as soon as possible.
EU leaders are set to assess Turkey's bid for membership at the end of 2004.

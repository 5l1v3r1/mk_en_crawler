BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian authorities say they have detained former Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by Banja Luka. 
The Serbian Justice Ministry said that Belgrade will extradite Klickovic to Bosnia and Herzegovina once a request is filed by the relevant institutions there. 
The former prime minister faces charges of abuse of office and embezzlement of funds from the RS budget. 
In other news, a top suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic has been granted protected witness status. 
The Belgrade court that is handling the case said Dejan Milenkovic has agreed to expand his testimony in exchange for the status.

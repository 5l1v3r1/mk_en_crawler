PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Illegal parallel structures are operating in Kosovo in areas where local security forces have no influence, the OSCE said in a report published on Wednesday (October 3rd).
The document, confirmed by the Kosovo Interior Ministry, says there are Albanian forces in the south and Serbian forces in the north that may lead to instability across the whole province.
Macedonian security forces also are watching developments in the breakaway province.
In other news Wednesday, government spokesman Avni Arifi vowed that the Kosovo cabinet will continue approving laws based on former UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan.
On Tuesday, UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker called for a halt to such measures until Kosovo's final status is resolved.
Arifi said it is the government's duty to prepare all necessary legal documents, regardless of when they take effect.

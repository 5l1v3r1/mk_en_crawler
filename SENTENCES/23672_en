ANKARA, Turkey -- A court on Sunday (January 25th) charged nine more police officers in connection with a probe into the shadowy secularist group Ergenekon, which allegedly was plotting an anti-government coup.
The officers include members of the police special forces, as well as a local police chief in the eastern city of Elazig.
Authorities charged them with "membership in a terrorist organisation" and remanded them into custody.
On Monday, a court in Istanbul charged a union leader in connection with the controversial case, making him the 18th suspect in the latest wave of the Ergenekon investigation.
Last week, police detained 26 people in simultaneous operations across the country and searched the offices of a private TV channel and a union in Ankara.
They released the remaining eight people, including Turkish Metal Union executives, researcher Erhan Goksel and journalist Unal Inanc, without charges.
A total of 86 alleged Ergenekon members are currently on trial, charged with "forming or being a member of a terrorist organisation".

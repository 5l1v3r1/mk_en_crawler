DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Bulgarian Finance Minister Milen Velchev met with IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger on Sunday (21 September), within the framework of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank.
During the meeting, Krueger expressed satisfaction with the Bulgarian government's fiscal policy, credited with the successful implementation of the IMF-supported programme, but noted that structural reforms have fallen behind schedule.
According to Velchev, the Fund expressed its willingness to continue its co-operation with Bulgaria under a precautionary agreement, which would provide access to financing without obliging the government to use it.
In other news, Transport Minister Nikolay Vassilev held talks with Dubai companies on the possible participation of Bulgarian haulers in the transportation of goods through Dubai.
Vassilev said Dubai would play an important role as a corridor to Kuwait and post-war Iraq.
Meanwhile, the Bulgarian Education Ministry announced plans to sign a four-year co-operation agreement with China.
The two countries would exchange undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as lecturers.

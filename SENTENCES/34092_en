ZAGREB, Croatia -- Luxembourg has ratified Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, becoming the 11th EU member state to do so, according to the foreign ministry. 
Three countries -- Belgium, Italy and Finland -- are expected to follow shortly. 
Britain, however, says it will not resume the ratification procedure until Croatia fully co-operates with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Talking to reporters in Zagreb on Monday (21 July), Prime Minister Ivica Racan called on retired Croatian Gen Ante Gotovina to surrender. 
"Unless Gen Gotovina makes the final move, time is running out both for him and for Croatia," said Racan.

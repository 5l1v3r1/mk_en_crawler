ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police announced on Friday (September 10th) over 500 guns turned in after the 1991 ethnic war have been stolen from a police depot and sold on the black market.
An officer who guarded the depot has been arrested and charged with embezzlement, police spokesperson Krunoslav Borovec said, adding that charges of illegal weapons sales may also be filed.
Two other people are suspected of buying guns illegally.
The investigation continues.
The guns, worth around 4,100 euros, are believed to have been stolen in 2006 and 2007.
They were collected from members of the public who responded to a government call to turn in weapons after the war ended.

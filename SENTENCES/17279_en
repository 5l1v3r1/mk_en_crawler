ATHENS, Greece -- The death toll from a flooded river in the southern Peloponnese region has climbed to six, according to media reports Monday (May 28th). 
The Lousios River swamped its banks Saturday, sweeping away eight members of a hiking group as they tried to cross the river. 
Five people were killed, three were missing and ten managed to escape. 
After a day of search and rescue, authorities said late Sunday that another body had been found, and a survivor spotted. 
Charges may be filed against employees of the company that organised the hiking excursion.

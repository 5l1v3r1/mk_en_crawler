ATHENS, Greece -- Another wave of strikes took place in Greece on Thursday (May 15th).
Organised by one of the biggest trade unions in the country, the GSEE, this one protests recent privatisations, including the deal reached by the state telecommunications company, OTE, with Germany's Deutsche Telekom, as well as pension reform and high consumer prices.
OTE and ports have stopped work for 24 hours.
Employees of the national electricity utility (DEI), the national postal service (ELTA), Olympic Airlines and the water supply and sewerage company in Athens are closing for five hours, a little longer than the walkout by public sector employees.
Banks are also closed.

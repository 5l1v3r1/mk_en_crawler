SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Portuguese Prime Minister Durao Barroso said Tuesday (10 February) the EU accession of Bulgaria and Romania should not be delayed, as this could have an "adverse effect" on Europe. 
Barroso, making an official visit to Bulgaria, said that if either of the countries experiences problems with the integration process, they should receive help. 
Both should enter the Union in 2007 as expected, he said.
In other news Tuesday, the European Commission presented a draft financial package for Bulgaria and Romania, offering a total of 15.4 billion euros during their first three years of EU membership. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen described the aid as "both generous and realistic".

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu says the country will support Croatia, Macedonia and Albania's NATO bids, as it is in Romania's own interest.
In a speech aired Monday (March 31st) on the TVR television station, Basescu said it is important that his country be surrounded by allies and friends, adding he hopes Greece and Macedonia will manage to settle their longstanding name dispute.
He said that finding ways to boost dialogue with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is just as important and added that intensive dialogue with Montenegro should be launched as soon as possible.
Basescu also said Romania will support an action plan for Ukraine and Georgia's NATO accessions because they are key to security.
Bucharest begins hosting a two-day NATO summit on Wednesday.

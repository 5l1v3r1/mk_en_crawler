PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic announced his resignation on Thursday (January 31st) due to health concerns.
He was diagnosed months ago with a rare type of lung tumour.
Sturanovic, 46, became prime minister in November 2006.
Sources say Milo Djukanovic, leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, may return to the helm of the government.

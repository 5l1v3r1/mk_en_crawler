SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ruling Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia (SDSM) will propose that upcoming local elections be postponed by a month, local media reported Wednesday (28 July).
President Branko Crvenkovski was to determine the exact date of the elections by 7 August.
That now appears impossible, due to prolonged debate in parliament over the controversial decentralisation bill, which stipulates the redrawing of municipalities to reduce the total number.
The SDSM says it would be pointless to elect mayors under the old legislation.
Since Monday, the opposition has proposed 160 amendments to the bill.

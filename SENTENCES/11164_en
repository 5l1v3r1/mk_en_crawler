TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu criticised the main parties Sunday (27 March) for the stalemate over a date for parliamentary elections.
By law, the Albanian president approves the date, but the proposal comes from parliament.
Moisiu says he has been urging the parties to agree on the issue since December, but no consensus had been reached.
The ruling Socialist Party wants the elections in July, while the main opposition Democratic Party favours June.
In other news, Public Order Minister Igli Toska announced that Albania and Belgium have signed an agreement on readmission and police co-operation.
It would result in an exchange of information about a number of individuals who live in Belgium but are wanted by the Albanian judiciary.

Regular consumption of a few glasses of wine weekly has a positive effect on human health and can help fight tumours, according to research by a team of Greek scientists. 
The findings were presented at the Detrop food and drink exhibition in Thessaloniki last week. 
The project co-ordinator, University of Thessaly biochemistry professor Dimitris Kouretas, said his team had been working on the study since 2004. 
They found that grapes -- and, subsequently, both white and red wines -- conduct plant polyphenols, which positively influence human cells, bacteria and enzymes.

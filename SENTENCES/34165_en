ZAGREB, Croatia -- The project to build the Pan-European Transport Corridor Vc and the status of the Ploce and Neum ports will be the likely focus of talks Monday (14 July)between BiH and Croatian officials in Sarajevo.
The Croatian delegation, led by Prime Minister Ivica Racan, started its official two-day visit Sunday, with the aim of co-ordinating political and economic relations between the neighbours.
Racan is expected to lobby for Croatian companies to act as subcontractors in the Vc construction project.

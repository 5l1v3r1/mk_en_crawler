BELGRADE, Serbia -- Jovan Krkobabic was unanimously re-elected on Sunday (April 25th) as leader of the Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS). 
At a congress in Belgrade, he vowed to continue working for Serbia's EU integration. 
President Boris Tadic, who attended the congress, rejected calls by the opposition for early elections, saying they would only lead to destabilisation.

SYDNEY, Australia -- Former Serb militia commander Dragan Vasiljkovic is to be handed over to Croatia to face war crimes charges after the Australian High Court overturned a federal court's decision against the extradition Tuesday (March 30th).
The High Court ruled in favour of the government's appeal.
The lower federal court had ruled that Vasiljkovic could not be extradited to Croatia because he would not receive a fair trial there.
Known as "Captain Dragan", Vasiljkovic is accused by Zagreb of involvement in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Political leaders met on Monday (October 6th) but failed to reach a joint position on the long-standing name dispute with Greece. 
They had hoped for consensus ahead of Tuesday's meeting in New York between the UN envoy in the dispute, Matthew Nimetz, and the representatives of Athens and Skopje in the talks. 
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and his coalition partners continue to insist that a dual formula, under which the country would keep its constitutional name but use a different one internationally, is the best solution to the name dispute. 
President Branko Crvenkovski and two smaller parties reject the dual formula.

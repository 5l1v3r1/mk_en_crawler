BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Turkey again on Thursday (7 September) to accelerate the pace of reforms ahead of a 24 October evaluation report by the European Commission.
Meeting with Turkey's chief EU negotiator Ali Babacan in Brussels, Rehn cautioned that the Union is very sensitive on certain issues, such as the rights of religious minorities, and that Ankara should ensure progress in such fields.
For his part, Babacan warned that a collapse of Turkey's accession talks could have "devastating" consequences.
In Athens, meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis discussed Turkey's EU bid with Dutch counterpart Bernard Bot.
Bakoyannis said that the process depends on how well Ankara implements its pre-accession commitments to the Union, including the 2005 extended customs union accord obliging it to open its air and naval space to Greek Cypriot planes and ships.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers postponed a decision Tuesday (December 8th) on setting a start date for EU membership talks with Macedonia, and agreed to discuss the issue again in the first half of 2010.
Spain will hold the rotating EU presidency at that point.
Current holder Sweden had presented drafts on the issue but failed to win a consensus among the ministers Monday.
Greece opposes setting any framework for starting accession talks with Macedonia until the name dispute between the two countries is resolved.
With regard to Turkey, the EU urged Ankara on Monday to open its seaports and airports to Cypriot vessels and aircraft, insisting that the move is an important step in Ankara's EU accession bid.
Turkey has maintained that the EU must first end the economic isolation of Turkish Cypriots.
Regarding Albania, the EU urged leaders to engage in constructive political dialogue.
The opposition Socialist Party has been boycotting work in parliament until the government agrees to investigate alleged fraud in the June general elections.

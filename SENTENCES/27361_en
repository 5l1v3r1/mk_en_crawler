SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The European Parliament's Special Rapporteur for Macedonia, Zoran Thaler, says that without resolving its name dispute with Greece, Macedonia jeopardises its chances to receive a start date for EU accession talks in June. 
"If there is progress, Macedonia's negotiations will be launched, including concrete tasks for the country, which would be good. 
On the contrary, and unfortunately this is currently the more realistic option, Macedonia could gradually be taken off the agenda. 
This means you will no longer be [the] focus of the EC's attention," Thaler told reporters in Skopje on Thursday (May 27th). 
"We do our utmost to resolve the dispute and to join the EU, and there should be no doubt about it," Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski responded on Friday.

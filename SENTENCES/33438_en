BELGRADE, Serbia and Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted late Friday (30 May) to ban human rights abusers from public office. 
All ministers, lawmakers, magistrates and top army commanders are to be checked by a special commission. 
Anyone found to have committed human rights violations in the past 25 years will be replaced.
In other news, the G17 Plus party launched a campaign Saturday for an independent Serbia. 
G17 Plus recently adopted a pro-independence platform at its party congress.
In Montenegro, meanwhile, a prosecutor dropped a controversial case against four people, including the state deputy chief prosecutor, accused by a Moldovan woman of human trafficking. 
Her lawyer describes the ruling as "scandalous".

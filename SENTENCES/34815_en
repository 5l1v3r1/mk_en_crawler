SKOPJE, Macedonia -- More than 100,000 people possess illegal weapons in Macedonia, the UNDP announced Wednesday (6 August).
A UNDP survey found that at least 40 per cent of Macedonians think that there are too many weapons in the country.
The official media campaign on popularisation of the collection process had been due to kick off on 6 August, but the UNDP said the start will be delayed until September.
In other news Wednesday, the Albanian language daily <I>Fakti</I> published the details about the defence ministry's plan for proportional representation of ethnic minorities in the Macedonian Army as part of reforms required by the Ohrid Peace Accord.
Under the plan, Albanian troops should account for 23 per cent of the 11,000-strong army by 2007.
Currently, there are 70 Albanian officers and 170 non-commissioned officers in the army.

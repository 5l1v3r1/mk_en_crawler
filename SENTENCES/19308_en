PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic indicated on Tuesday (August 28th) that out of respect for the work of The Hague war crimes tribunal, Montenegro has again banned Serbian Orthodox Church's Bishop Filaret from entering the country. 
Filaret, who was denied access on suspicion of aiding war crimes fugitives, pitched a tent at the border Tuesday and announced the start of a hunger strike to protest the ban. 
He is on a list of people suspected by The Hague tribunal of helping ethnic Serbs escape justice, and has been banned from entering Montenegro four times.

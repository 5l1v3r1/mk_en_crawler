ZAGREB, Croatia -- State television aired documents Wednesday (December 5th) that seem to prove direct involvement of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) in war crimes committed in the village of Lovas in 1991.
One document, published in the 2nd journal of the JNA motorised brigade, ordered the Vajevo territorial defence unit to clear a vineyard in the village in October 1991, where the interior ministry allegedly had bases.
The squad feared the vineyard was mined and made residents of Lovas lead the way, killing 22 people.
Late last month, war crimes prosecutors in Serbia charged 14 people, including members of the JNA local authorities and the so-called "Dusan the Mighty" paramilitary unit, in connection with atrocities in Lovas.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak welcomed on Thursday (November 6th) Wednesday's ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU by the country's presidency. 
"By completing the ratification process, BiH is, for the first time, in a formal and legally binding contractual relationship with the EU. 
This sends a signal that the country wants to make progress and is open for business," Lajcak said. 
The SAA was signed on June 16th in Luxembourg.
In other news, Federation of BiH (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS) leaders came to a landmark agreement Thursday on the principles of energy policy, overcoming differences that have dominated the sector since the 1992-1995 conflict ended. 
The deal, signed by the entity prime ministers at an emergency meeting in Banja Luka, stipulates standardised fuel prices nationwide, which the state will set. 
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric later told reporters that the agreement reinstates the regulatory role of the state in setting the maximum prices of oil and derivatives. 
Furthermore, the country will now be able to introduce an excise tax for the development and operation of a network of highways and roads. 
The leaders also reached agreement on outstanding issues that blocked the operation of a nationwide power network after RS threatened in September to create its own regulator.

TIRANA, Albania -- The government delivered answers Thursday (June 10th) to additional questions asked by the European Commission (EC) in Albania's bid for EU candidate status. 
The integration ministry responded to 170 questions the country was asked, in addition to a questionnaire submitted in April when Albania first applied. 
Right now, there are two expert missions in Albania and three more will be arriving, to verify the answers Tirana provided.

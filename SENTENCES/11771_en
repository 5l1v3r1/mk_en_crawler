BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will pay a visit to Serbia-Montenegro on Monday (18 July). 
Aides say he will meet senior officials and address a Club de Madrid International Forum.
On Friday, de Hoop Scheffer told the Beta news agency that the Balkans' Euro-Atlantic integration was possible only via lasting peace and stability. 
He repeated that realisation of Serbia-Montenegro's aspirations to join the Alliance depend on the efforts of local authorities -- particularly co-operation with the UN tribunal -- and defence reforms.

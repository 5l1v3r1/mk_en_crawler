BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- OSCE Ambassador to Belgrade Maurizio Massari called for the opening Saturday (5 March) of secret service files in Serbia-Montenegro, stressing the importance of the issue for individual rights protection. 
His comment came during an OSCE-hosted roundtable that included members of parliament, as well as representatives of security services and NGOs. 
No post-authoritarian society, in Europe or elsewhere, can avoid the issue of opening secret files, Massari said. 
He added, however, that the process should be accompanied by safeguards, including effective parliamentary oversight.
In other news, Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic announced on Sunday the start of intensive reforms aimed at boosting the ministry's performance. 
They include the establishment of a criminal intelligence service and an anti-terrorist service, as well as a restructuring of the border police.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish and Bulgarian officials met on Wednesday (15 March) to discuss establishment of a flood early warning system.
The talks followed widespread flooding in Turkey's northern regions.
The army had to help evacuate residents of Edirne and surrounding areas when the rivers Maritsa, Arda and Tundzha topped their banks.
Ankara wants Bulgaria to help build a dam that would help prevent similar situations in the future.
Bulgaria had to open floodgates on Tuesday to prevent dams on the three rivers from overflowing.
In other news, Bulgarian Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov was due to finish a three-day visit to Turkey on Thursday.
The focus was on possible joint projects in the military sector, as well as bilateral military co-operation, including two dozen joint drills this year.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Thursday (January 27th) that politicians should speed up talks to form a new government in the wake of the October 2010 general elections, describing the current pace as unacceptably slow. 
"Politicians have received mandates â¦ to govern. 
They waste time playing power games, when they should start resolving the issues that become more pressing with each passing day -- the fight against crime and corruption, economic recovery and a return to the reform agenda for EU and NATO integration," Inzko said during a meeting with acting BiH House of Representatives Speaker Adnan Basic in Sarajevo.
During a visit of his own Wednesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that the OHR -- as an institution -- should be transformed into an Office of the EU Representative. 
Bildt stressed that the responsibility for the Euro-Atlantic integration reform lies fully with BiH politicians. 
The EU's doors remain open, he added, but it is up to BiH's leaders to make the bid reality.

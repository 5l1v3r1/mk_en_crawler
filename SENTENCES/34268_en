TIRANA, Albania -- After several days of discussion, leaders of the ruling Socialist Party adopted a draft resolution Tuesday (1 July) that is expected to improve the work of government. 
It was approved in response to criticism from Foreign Minister Ilir Meta, who said there was room for improvement. 
The document calls for more active participation by all members of the party and appeals for better co-operation with the opposition to ensure legitimate elections.

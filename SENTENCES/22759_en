SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The trial of Rade Veselinovic, a Bosnian Serb charged with war crimes committed in 1992 in the Sarajevo suburb of Hadzici, will begin on July 18th. 
Officials set the date on Tuesday (July 8th) at a status conference on the case. 
The prosecution has scheduled hearings for 32 witnesses and the presentation of 68 pieces of material evidence. 
At the Tuesday conference, however, Prosecutor Milorad Barasin said the number of witnesses "may be reduced" depending on the course of the presentation.
Veselinovic, who worked for the Military Police Squad in Republika Srpska (RS), stands accused of murder, torture, forced disappearances, illegal detentions and other war crimes.

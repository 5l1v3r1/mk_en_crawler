BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) demanded on Wednesday (22 December) that the EU Council of Ministers launch disciplinary proceedings against Greece for breaking the Eurozone rules.
Several weeks ago, it was revealed that Greece has repeatedly misrepresented its fiscal performance and that its deficit has topped the EU's limit -- 3 per cent of GDP -- since 1997.
The EC also noted that the fiscal situation in Greece further deteriorated this year and projected a deficit of 5.3 per cent of GDP, again clearly above the Eurozone limit.

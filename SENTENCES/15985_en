LONDON, Great Britain -- The EBRD on Friday (19 May) announced the establishment of a new initiative, the 10m-euro Western Balkans Multi-Donor Fund, which will support private business investment and infrastructure development, and help narrow the transition gap occurring between the Western Balkan states and their neighbours.
Ten Western European countries and Canada have already agreed to be donors, and more are expected, the EBRD said in a press release.

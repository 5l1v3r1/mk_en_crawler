ANKARA, Turkey -- US Defence Secretary Robert Gates urged Turkey on Sunday (February 24th) to make its military operation against the PKK brief.
He urged Ankara to undertake political and economic measures to isolate the group.
Gates also called on Ankara to protect Iraq's sovereignty and to improve its communication with Baghdad both in relation to the ongoing operation and to its other activities against the PKK.
Also on Sunday, the PKK claimed to have shot down a Turkish Cobra helicopter.
However, the allegation has not been confirmed either by the Turkish military or by independent sources.
The PKK also says it killed 22 Turkish soldiers since the start of the ground operation on Thursday, but this figure is disputed by the Turkish General Staff, which said on its website Saturday that only seven were killed.
More than 70 PKK activists have been killed since the start of the Turkish military offensive against the organisation, the military added.
A few hundred thousand people gathered in Istanbul on Saturday to protest the anti-PKK operation in northern Iraq.
Participants in the rally, organised by the pro-Kurdish Party of Democratic Society (DTP), chanted "The operation is a problem, not a solution".

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (April 28th) voted against a bill that would have imposed a complete ban on smoking in cafes, restaurants and bars, starting on June 1st. 
According to lawmakers, the proposed ban would harm a sector already reeling from the financial crisis. 
Still, the ruling party, Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), proposed an amendment to the current legislation that would allow owners of smaller bars, cafes or restaurants to decide for themselves whether to impose the ban. 
In all other cases, there would be separate, non-smoking tables.

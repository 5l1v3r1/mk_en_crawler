ANKARA, Turkey -- One of Turkey's most wanted fugitive criminals, Haluk Kirci, is to be extradited from Ukraine on Wednesday (19 January), according to media reports in Ankara. 
Kirci was convicted of involvement in organised crime activities as well as the murder of seven students in Ankara in the 1970s. 
The former member of the extremist organisation Grey Wolves was sentenced several times but thus far has escaped justice. 
He was detained in Ukraine in October.

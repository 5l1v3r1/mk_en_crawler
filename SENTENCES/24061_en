ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged civil and military judiciary authorities Tuesday (June 16th) to speed up the investigation of an alleged army plot to discredit the government. 
"If the allegations are false and aim to cause provocation and confrontation between state institutions, that would be grave. 
If they are true, that would be even more serious," said Erdogan. 
The prime minister met with Chief of General Staff General Ilker Basbug to discuss the alleged military plot. 
Last week, the liberal daily Taraf claimed military circles had prepared a plan "to break popular support" for the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and one of its influential supporters, Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen. 
The plotters reportedly planned to stir divisions in the AKP and plant weapons and ammunition in houses used by the religious movement to create the impression it was involved in militant activities.

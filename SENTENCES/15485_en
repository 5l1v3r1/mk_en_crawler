SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH has made enough progress for the Office of the High Representative to be closed next year, says the current holder of the post, Christian Schwarz-Schilling.
"Today's nature of the international community's involvement in Bosnia must change, as the country moves from peace implementation to Euro-Atlantic integration," he said Saturday (24 June).
Meanwhile, the steering board of the Peace Implementation Council has decided to start preparations for closing the office by 30 June 2007, according to a press statement issued after a meeting this weekend.

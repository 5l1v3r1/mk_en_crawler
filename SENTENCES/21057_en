SIROKI BRIJEG, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Leaders of the six parties in the BiH ruling state-level coalition agreed on Saturday (February 2nd) to begin talks on constitutional reform after BiH signs a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The parties agreed to meet all conditions for the signing within the agreed-upon deadlines, particularly to finalise work on key police reform by February 15th.
However, Sulejman Tihic's Party of Democratic Action (SDA) announced it would pull out of police reform talks, as ongoing efforts only seem to preserve the status quo.
Tihic acknowledged however the legislation could pass without the support of his SDA.
The other party leaders criticised the move, especially when an issue as important as EU integration is at stake.
In other news, employees from the BiH State Investigation and Protection Agency, the BiH border police and the court police in the Federation BiH threatened to go on strike Saturday, unless they receive better pay.
They say they make far less than counterparts in the entity and cantonal units.

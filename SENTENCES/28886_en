TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission's (EC) annual report on Albania's progress on its road to EU integration was delivered to authorities in Tirana on Wednesday (November 10th). 
EC Directorate General Enlargement Director for Western Balkans Pierre Mirel met with President Bamir Topi, and said the report has to be seen as a wake-up call.
Key findings of the report noted the poor quality of laws being adopted, the fact that the parliament does not function as an independent body, and the politicised public administration.
Meanwhile, speaking to BBC on Wednesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said that the political stalemate is the main reason that Albania was denied EU candidate status. 
He explained that the functioning of democratic institutions is linked to the Copenhagen Criteria. 
In Tirana, members of the government praised the achievements cited in the report, but insisted that the political stalemate can be resolved only by respecting existing legislation. 
The opposition, meanwhile, accused the government of failing to secure democracy and contributing to nepotism in the political administration.(BBC, VoA, Shekulli, Top Channel, Balkan Web, Lajmifundit - 10/11/10)

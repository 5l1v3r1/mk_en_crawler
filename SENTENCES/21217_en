SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) unveiled plans Sunday (June 29th) to propose a package of measures to beef up financial requirements for participation in general elections.
The BSP wants the registration fee raised from 10,000 euros to 25,000 euros, which parties would forfeit if they win less than 1% of the vote.
Parties would also have to prove they have regional structures that extend over at least two-thirds of the country.
Parallel to that, the state subsidy would rise threefold to reduce parties' dependence on suspect outside funding.
In addition, the BSP wants parties that failed to win at least 2% in the past two general elections removed from the registry.
The BSP acknowledges it must co-ordinate the proposals with its ruling coalition partners.

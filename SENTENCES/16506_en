TIRANA, Albania -- The country's main parties agreed on Monday (10 April) on changes to parliamentary regulations related to the appointment and dismissal of senior officials, thus ending a two-month row that has blocked the work of the legislature. 
According to the deal struck by the ruling and opposition parties, the legislature would vote by secret ballot, if requested by at least seven deputies. 
Otherwise, the vote would be electronic. 
After signing the agreement, the major opposition Socialist Party agreed to end its boycott of committee sessions. 
President Alfred Moisiu described the deal as a positive step towards normalising politics.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Local prosecutors have reopened an investigation into a plane crash that claimed the life of General Esref Bitlis in 1993, media reported on Thursday (September 30th).
Local press have been quoting aviation experts recently who suggest the incident could have been an act of sabotage.
Retired Colonel Arif Dogan, a suspect in the so-called Ergenekon case, was questioned on Thursday over a leaked wiretapped conversation suggesting he had played a role in the death.
Bitlis was Gendarmerie Commander at the time.

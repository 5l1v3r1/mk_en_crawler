SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz reiterated on Monday (October 18th) that the court's top priority remains the arrest of two high-profile war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic. 
After talks with members of BiH's tripartite presidency, Brammertz urged countries in the region and the international community to exert more effort, noting that even after the tribunal closes, there will be mechanisms in place to succeed it. 
During his visit to Sarajevo, Brammertz met with High Representative Valentin Inzko. 
Both voiced concern over BiH's lack of progress in implementing its war crimes processing strategy. 
Brammertz visits Croatia next and then Serbia in November, gathering information he needs to write reports on each country's level of co-operation.

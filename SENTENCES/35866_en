BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatian Foreign Minister Miomir Zuzul told European lawmakers on Thursday (22 January) that his government is fully committed to co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
He indicated that "full and unreserved co-operation" were important for Croatia's EU membership bid.
In seeking the start of accession talks, he told members of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee that Croatia has set for itself the "goal of vigorously proceeding with the reform process in order to be ready to assume the obligations of EU membership by 2007-2008".

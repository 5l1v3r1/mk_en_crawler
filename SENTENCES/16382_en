THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal decided on Wednesday (12 April) to transfer one more case to the new war crimes court in Sarajevo.
Pasko Ljubicic, a Bosnian Croat, will be tried for atrocities allegedly committed by troops under his command in Ahmici in April 1993.
Prosecutors say he commanded a military police battalion that raided the village, killing 100 of its Muslim residents and burning down houses.
In other news, the tribunal ruled Wednesday that former Yugoslav Army officer Vladimir Kovacevic, nicknamed "Rambo", is mentally unfit to stand trial.
He was indicted in connection with the bombing of Dubrovnik, but was granted provisional release in 2004.
Criminal proceedings against him could be reinstated if his situation improves.
Also Wednesday, Danish police announced that Bosnian prosecutors have indicted two men on charges they were planning an attack on an undisclosed European country.
Swedish citizen Mirsad Bektasevic and Turkish national Cesur Abdulkadir were arrested in Sarajevo in October following an international operation involving Denmark.

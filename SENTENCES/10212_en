BUCHAREST, Romania -- The 30-day campaign for the 28 November general elections begins Thursday (28 October).
It will be the last time the parliamentary and presidential races will be held together, since under the amended constitution the elections will be split starting in 2007.
President Ion Iliescu went before parliament on Wednesday, assessing the results of his years in office.
Term limits prevent him from seeking re-election.
He is, however, running for the Senate as a candidate of the ruling Social Democratic Party.

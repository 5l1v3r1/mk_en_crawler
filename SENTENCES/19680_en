BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities have confirmed that a third farm in Timis county is infected with pig plague.
All three farms are owned by the US company Smithfield, according to press reports Thursday (August 23rd).
The president of the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, Radu Roatis, said Romania will ask on Friday that the Veterinary Committee of the European Commission extend the deadline for registration of pig farms until the end of the year, in light of efforts to fight the plague.
The EC plans to send a team to evaluate the plague vaccination campaign next month.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs should participate in the November 15th municipal elections, as that vote has nothing to do with Kosovo's status, said both Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith.
"Citizens should get their destiny in their hands and should vote for their representatives," Feith said at a meeting with Thaci outside Pristina on Friday (October 2nd), adding that elections can promote the decentralisation process.
Feith warned that if Serbs do not participate in the vote, they may lose power in their municipalities.
He also urged Belgrade not to interfere.

PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- Turkey should be invited to start accession talks with the EU, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said during a visit to the Czech Republic on Tuesday (31 August).
He urged sceptics to consider the "strategic implications" of pushing the country out of Europe.
"Turkey is a European nation and part of Europe's history.
It is entitled as a member of the Council of Europe and NATO to make an application for membership of the EU," Straw said.
Meanwhile, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen said Tuesday that accession talks with Turkey should start in June 2005.
EU leaders are expected to decide at a summit in December whether to launch the talks.
The decision will be based largely on a European Commission report that will be issued next month.
In other news Tuesday, Ankara announced that 11 members of the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party, now renamed KONGRA-GEL, were killed during three days of clashes with security forces.
Two soldiers were also killed in the fighting near the Iraqi border.

LUXEMBOURG -- EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (October 25th) to ask the European Commission to start assessing Serbia's EU membership application, but at the same time warned that Belgrade's further progress will depend on its full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
"Serbia's assistance in the key matter of the arrest of the two remaining fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic â¦ would be the most convincing proof of Serbia's efforts and co-operation," a joint declaration, quoted by DPA, reads.
Serbia submitted its membership application last December.

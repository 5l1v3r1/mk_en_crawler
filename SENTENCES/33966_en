SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The cantonal court in Sarajevo sentenced a former Bosnian Muslim soldier to 10 years in prison Tuesday (4 November) for his role in the massacre of Croat civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Enes Sakrak, 30, was among troops who killed 30 Croats in the village of Grabovica in September 1993. 
He was arrested in August and subsequently admitted to killing a woman and her four-year-old child. 
A co-defendant has also been arrested. 
Bosnian Muslim wartime Army Chief of Staff Sefer Halilovic is to be tried separately for failing to prevent the massacre.
In other news Tuesday, BiH Deputy Minister for Human Rights and Refugees Ivica Marinovic said the country completed 88 per cent of the property returns set under laws implementing the Dayton Peace Accord. 
Marinovic says he considers the data a good indicator of compliance with monitored reform criteria. 
Such efforts got a financial boost Tuesday, when a donor conference organised by the OSCE raised around 5m euros in grants earmarked for reforms.

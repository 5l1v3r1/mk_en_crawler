SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Xhevat Ademi, a leading official of the Albanian National Democratic Party, called the Associated Press on Sunday (3 November) to complain that he had been arrested by Macedonian police on charges he led a guerrilla group during last year's insurgency. 
He described it as a poor start for the new government, voted in late last week. 
Ademi's party has one seat in parliament and is not a member of the coalition cabinet. 
Prosecutors have issued arrest warrants against several former National Liberation Army leaders, including Ali Ahmeti, accusing them of crimes that were not covered by the amnesty offered under the Ohrid peace accords. 
Though Macedonian police would not comment on Ademi's detention, a spokesman for the interior ministry later confirmed it occurred at the Blato checkpoint on the Macedonian-Albanian border.

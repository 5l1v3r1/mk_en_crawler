ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is trying to summon members of parliament for an extraordinary session to debate the latest developments concerning the border with northern Iraq and the fight against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Parliament began its summer recess on June 3rd, which means the CHP needs the signature of at least 110 MPs to hold an emergency session.
In other news, two of Turkey's main centre right parties, the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the Democrat Party, reportedly agreed on Friday (June 8th) to revive efforts to form a coalition ahead of July 22nd general elections. 
A week ago, they said the effort had failed. 
ANAP even hinted it might not participate in the elections, as it has almost no chance of meeting the 10% threshold.

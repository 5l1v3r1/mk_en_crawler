SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The first bus carrying Macedonians and Serbians who sought asylum in Belgium arrived home Thursday (March 11th).
The group was extradited for violating EU visa-free travel rules.
A wave of Macedonian and Serbian citizens have sought asylum in Belgium and Sweden since the two Balkan countries were given visa-free EU travel in December.
Most of them cited economic reasons for their requests, an argument that authorities in Belgium have consistently rejected.

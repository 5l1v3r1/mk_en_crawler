BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vojislav Kostunica announced Friday night (13 February) that the democratic parties now appear closer to forming a government than to calling new general elections.
His comments followed talks by the democratic bloc on forming a minority government supported either by the Socialists or the Democratic Party (DS).
On Saturday, the main board of G17 Plus voted to support any government, regardless of who else supports it.
Also, despite some opposition from leader Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian Renewal Movement party is expected to enter the government, according to senior official Bojan Dimitrijevic.

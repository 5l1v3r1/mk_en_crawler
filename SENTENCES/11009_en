SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As a candidate for EU membership, Bulgaria is expected to quickly form a stable and strong government, one capable of moving ahead with accession-related reforms, European Commission (EC) spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio said Thursday (28 July). 
He rejected speculation the EC has already decided to delay Bulgaria's EU entry, stressing that Sofia still has time to wrap up reforms necessary for accession in January 2007. 
Since parliamentary elections on 25 June, the winning Socialist Party has been trying to form a coalition government. 
President Georgi Parvanov said Thursday he is now poised to give the mandate to the second place finisher, the ruling Simeon II National Movement.

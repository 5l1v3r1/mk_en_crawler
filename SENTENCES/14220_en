ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said on Monday (12 December) that those who helped top war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina evade justice must also assume their legal responsibility.
In a statement for Croatian Radio, Mesic said it is absolutely necessary to track down Gotovina's supporters.
Last week, the general -- who has been on the run for four years and a half -- was finally detained and brought to the UN tribunal.
In his first appearance Monday, Gotovina pleaded not guilty to charges of war crimes committed against the Croatian Serb population in 1995.

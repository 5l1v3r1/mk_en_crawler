PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- In a change from past practice, UNMIK has decided not to appoint representatives from Kosovo districts where Serb turnout was low during last Saturday's (26 October) local elections. 
After Serbs boycotted the local vote in 2000, former UNMIK chief Bernard Couchner appointed representatives in Serb-dominated areas.

VIENNA, Austria -- Bosnian Army General Jovan Divjak was released Tuesday (March 8th) in Austria after posting a 500,000-euro bail, but can't leave the country until the court decides on his case. 
Divjak was detained on March 3rd at the Vienna airport based on a warrant issued by Serbia. 
He is wanted in connection with a May 1992 attack in Sarajevo against a Yugoslav National Army convoy, which left more than 40 soldiers dead.
In other news Tuesday, a judge in Salzburg decided to extend the detention of former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader by two months, pending extradition. 
Sanader was arrested on December 10th in Austria based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia where he is suspected of abuse of power. 
His extradition hearings were postponed in order to review an analysis submitted by Sanader's defence team, claiming that his human rights have been violated.

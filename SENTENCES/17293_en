SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Police Reform Directorate finished the drafting Friday (December 22nd) of its proposal for the country's police sector restructuring. 
The plan defines the responsibility and authority of all new institutions at the state level. 
However, it spells out the technical criteria for mapping future police regions, rather than specifying the map and regions' borders -- a source of controversy between BiH's entities.
In other news Friday, the Peace Implementation Council's steering board warned BiH authorities against unilateral action to revise or reverse the results of the police certification process conducted by the former UN International Police Task Force from 1996 to 2002. 
The ambassadors of the PIC board member states said they were very concerned by a recent decision of the BiH government to establish a domestic review mechanism for the issue. 
Such a move would violate UN Security Council resolutions and the Dayton Peace Agreement, they said.

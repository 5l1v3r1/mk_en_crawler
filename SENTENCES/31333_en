ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan told a national TV audience Tuesday (29 April) that general elections would take place in November or early next year.
Racan admitted his Social Democratic Party has not decided whether to participate individually in the elections or in a coalition with other ruling parties.
Separately, Racan expressed condolences to the family of Gen Janko Bobetko, who died Tuesday at the age of 84.
"We respected each other even when we did not agree in political matters," Racan told reporters.
In other news, during a visit to Austria on Tuesday, Croatian European Integration Minister Neven Mimica said the country would meet all EU accession conditions before the end of 2006.
He noted that the major problems in accession talks would be related to the return of refugees, co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, and judicial reforms.

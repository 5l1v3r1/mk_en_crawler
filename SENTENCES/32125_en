BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO is set to extend its military presence in Macedonia for another six months because the EU is not ready to replace it, a senior NATO official said Thursday (14 November).
The official added that the alliance would agree in the next couple of days to maintain a reduced force when the mandate of the 700-strong Amber Fox mission expires on 15 December.
The EU wanted to take over the mission with a new Rapid Reaction Force, but that has been held up for two years because of a disagreement between Greece and Turkey.
In other news, the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Croatia met Thursday, and indicated their countries may work together towards NATO membership.
Bulgaria and Romania adopted a similar strategy and appear headed for an invitation next week in Prague.

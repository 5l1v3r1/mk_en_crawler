STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik on Sunday (August 17th) visited with former RS President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving a sentence in a Swedish women's prison after The Hague tribunal convicted her of war crimes against Bosnian Muslims.
During their three-hour conversation, Dodik said he briefed Plavsic on the "progress of RS".
He described her as being in "good physical and mental health" and said she expects Swedish authorities to decide on her latest request for parole by the end of August.
She surrendered to The Hague in 2001, pleaded guilty and received an 11-year sentence for crimes against humanity.

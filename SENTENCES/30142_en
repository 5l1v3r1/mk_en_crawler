ATHENS, Greece -- Pharmacists, lawyers and railway workers launched a strike on Wednesday (January 19th) against austerity measures, including a proposal to open the so-called "closed professions".
Pharmacists and lawyers will strike for three days, while the railway workers' action will last two days, cancelling all train services.
The strikes coincided with the government submitting a draft measure to parliament that would open up dozens of professions that currently benefit from strictly controlled licensing or fixed profit margins.
The bill is part of the government's commitments under the country's 110 billion-euro bailout agreement with the EU and IMF.
It stipulates the liberalisation of around 140 professions, including lawyers, notaries, pharmacists, engineers, architects, builders, drivers and others.
Experts say the liberalisation will create new jobs and boost GDP.

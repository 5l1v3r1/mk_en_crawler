SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski announced on Friday (November 2nd) that Skopje rejects the UN's latest proposal to resolve the longstanding name dispute between Macedonia and Greece.
He said that any name different from the one in its constitution is unacceptable.
The UN's envoy for the talks, Matthew Nimitz, reportedly suggested that Macedonia accept a new name for international use, different from its constitutional name.

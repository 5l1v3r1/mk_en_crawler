BELGRADE, Serbia -- In a record voter turn-out, the Democratic Party (DS) led coalition won Sunday's (January 24th) local elections in Odzaci, Vojvodina, traditionally a stronghold of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS).
Results from the early elections showed that the "For a European Odzaci -Boris Tadic" coalition took 35% of the vote, trouncing the Serbian Progressive Party that got 22%.
Trailing was the small government ally, the Serbian Socialist Party-United Serbia-Party of United Pensioners of Serbia coalition, with 11%, followed by the SRS with 10%.
The Democratic Party of Serbia and G17 plus will also be represented on the municipal council.
The turn was 72%.
Early elections were called after none of the parties represented in the local parliament managed the necessary majority to rule in the May 2008 election.

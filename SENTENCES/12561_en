SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Ambassadors representing NATO member states urged the Macedonian government Wednesday (6 April) to tackle irregularities that surfaced during recent local elections. 
Following a meeting between the foreign diplomats and Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, British Ambassador Robert Dickson said there were concerns in Brussels over findings by international observers who monitored the latest municipal vote. 
He emphasised that the issue could have a decisive impact on Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration bid. 
On Thursday, Buckovski meets with the heads of the Supreme Court, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the interior ministry to discuss legal proceedings against those accused of violations.
In other news, a court in Kumanovo sentenced Hasan Kaliki to ten years in prison Wednesday for being an accomplice in a terrorist act that killed two NATO soldiers in March 2002. 
Two local ethnic Albanians have already been imprisoned.

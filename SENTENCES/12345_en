ANKARA, Turkey -- Opening a two-day visit to Turkey on Tuesday (11 January), the head of the US Central Command, General John Abizaid, asked Ankara to endorse the US use of Incirlik, a key military base in southern Turkey. 
After talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, Abizaid confirmed that Washington wants to use the base to provide logistical support to US troops in Iraq.
In other news Tuesday, officials of the Turkish, US and Iraqi administrations gathered in Ankara to discuss the presence of Kurdish terrorists in northern Iraq. 
They reportedly agreed on enhanced intelligence co-operation.
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Tuesday. 
Putin reaffirmed his country's support for the UN plan to reunify Cyprus, which was approved by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by Greek Cypriots in twin referenda last April.

ATHENS, Greece -- Public sector labour union ADEDY announced plans on Wednesday (November 10th) to hold a strike later this month against the government's austerity measures and job cuts. 
"We are planning strike action late in November, but we are not yet sure whether it will be for 24 hours," ADEDY Secretary-General Ilias Iliopoulos said.

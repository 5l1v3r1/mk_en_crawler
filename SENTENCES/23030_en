TIRANA, Albania -- US Ambassador to Albania John Withers said on Tuesday (June 3rd) that Washington remains committed to an independent investigation of the March 15th explosions at the ammunitions depot in Gerdec. 
During a meeting with Chief Prosecutor Ina Rama, Withers stressed that any attempt to influence the investigation from outside would disappoint Washington. 
"It is a constitutional right of the prosecution to carry out this investigation and not of any government organ," Withers said, adding that to resolve the issue parliament must settle the issue of immunity for members as soon as possible.
Separately Tuesday, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli urged Rama to provide the assembly with additional documents regarding the lifting of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu's immunity. 
He has been implicated in the deadly Gerdec blasts.

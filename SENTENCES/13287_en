TIRANA, Albania -- Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu said on Thursday (26 January) that the continuation of army reforms aimed at bringing Albania into NATO would be a primary task for the ministry this year. 
During a news conference in Tirana, Mediu said the restructuring of the defence sector in the next two years must gain momentum, so the country finally meets the criteria for NATO membership and receives an invitation from the Alliance in 2008. 
Continued participation in international peacekeeping operations is another priority, he added.

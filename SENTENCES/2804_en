A new grant by the United States will help Montenegro fight organised crime, including trafficking. 
Much of the aid, totaling 30,000 euros, will go towards educating and training state prosecutors, with the aim of boosting their capability and efficiency.
An agreement on the grant was signed on 15 July by Montenegro Chief State Prosecutor Vesna Medenica, Principal Officer at the US Consulate in Podgorica Hoyt Yee, and Sam Nazzaro, the justice department's resident legal adviser at the US Embassy in Belgrade.
Permanent training for state prosecutors is a necessity, Medenica said at the signing ceremony, especially in light of the republic's new procedural laws and the institutions that they establish. 
Given this situation, Montenegrin prosecutors have much to gain from studying the experience of others, she added.
Organised crime is a serious problem facing transitional countries, Yee said, noting that it hampers the establishment of a market economy and dissuades foreign investment.
According to Nazzaro, the aid also includes audio and video equipment, vital to a successful fight against criminals and the drug trade. 
In addition, it provides for the appointment of an intermittent legal adviser for Montenegro, who will oversee new training programmes -- as well as the existing ones -- being managed by the US Embassy in Belgrade.
This is not the first time Montenegro has received aid from Washington. 
Recently, the US Embassy sponsored a seminar on human trafficking in Southeast Europe, drawing participants from around the region. 
Another seminar, sponsored by the US Treasury Department, focused on the problem of money laundering. 
Some of the conclusions reached during that seminar later formed the basis for recommending modifications to Montenegro's criminal law.

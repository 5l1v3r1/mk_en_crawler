BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Serbia Michael Polt expressed disappointment Wednesday (June 13th) with the harsh rhetoric some Serbian politicians have used regarding US views on Kosovo's status. 
Polt noted that while it would not affect bilateral relations, the US had never used this kind of language towards Serbia. 
He refused to single out specific individuals or remarks, however.

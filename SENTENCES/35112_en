ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Tuesday (24 February) the government plans to set up a new advisory body, the Council for Economic Policy.
The ministers are expected to approve the line legislation for the council on Wednesday.
Next week, the government and the Council for Competitiveness are separately expected to present 55 economic measures to boost exports.
Sanader said he hopes EU authorities would grant Croatia the status of official candidate in the near term, to support the local economy.
In other news Tuesday, the head of the OSCE mission in Croatia, Peter Semneby, spoke before parliament's foreign policy committee, in a bid to streamline the country's programmes for return of refugees.
He presented the mission's policy priorities and commended local authorities for progress in many areas related to the return of refugees.
But he noted problems with accommodation and creation of a favourable social environment.

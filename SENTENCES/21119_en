SKOPJE, Macedonia -- There are no indications of serious security risks or threats to Macedonia's territorial integrity, President Branko Crvenkovski said on Monday (October 1st) in response to recent statements by Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic. 
On Thursday, the media quoted Tadic as saying that a number of escaped inmates from Kosovo prisons took refuge in Macedonia and were organising attacks on Serbia's southern municipalities. 
One of these prisoners, Burim Basha, told the Pristina-based newspaper Express on Monday that he is hiding in Skopje and had no intention of surrendering.
"These groups and their activities are closely watched ... 
(and) don't pose any threat to security," Crvenkovski said.

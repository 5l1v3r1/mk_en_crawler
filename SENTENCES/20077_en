ZAGREB, Croatia -- The new coalition cabinet being negotiated may include four deputy prime ministers and 16 ministers, compared to the current 12 ministers and two deputy prime ministers, sources close to the process said Monday (December 17th).
President Stipe Mesic gave Prime Minister Ivo Sanader the mandate to form a new cabinet on Saturday, following elections last month.
Sanader says an agreement could be reached by the end of the year, two weeks before the deadline, given the pace of talks among his party, Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS).
One of the most sensitive issues now being discussed is introduction of a controversial protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic.
The HDZ has been cautious regarding the ZERP, because it would anger Italy and Slovenia and likely lead to a stalemate in EU accession negotiations.
The HSS and the HSLS are ardent supporters of the ZERP and advocate a more protectionist policy in agriculture and fishing.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A new party of ethnic Albanians called Albanian Union has been established, local media reported on Sunday (November 28th). 
Its leader, Valjon Belja, who headed the NGO Realiteti, says his party will seek reforms in the political system and the "cantonisation" of the country. 
He says Macedonia could be divided in three cantons -- ethnic Albanian, Macedonian and an ethnically mixed one.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Two top US generals, including the commander of US forces in Iraq, met with the Turkish armed forces' second-in-command on Tuesday (November 20th) to discuss measures against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq. 
The meeting between the deputy chief of the Turkish General Staff, Ergin Saygun; US Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General James Cartwright; and US Commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, was described as a follow-up to talks between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President George W. 
Bush earlier this month.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan, in Brussels for a Turkey-EU Ministerial Troika meeting, criticised some European countries for allowing "short-term political interests" to hinder Turkey's EU integration process -- an apparent reference to French President Nicolas Sarkozy's insistence that Turkey has no place in the EU. 
"The negotiating chapters which are technically ready to be opened should not be subject to discrimination," Babacan added. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Rehn said after the meeting that at least two chapters should be opened by December.

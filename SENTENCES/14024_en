ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry said on Wednesday (14 December) that Turkey would bring Belgium's refusal to extradite a suspected leftist militant to the Council of Europe.
Fehriye Erdalis is accused of complicity in the murder of a Turkish businessman.
Ankara complains that Belgian authorities have failed to prosecute or extradite her.
In other news, Australia has added the Kurdistan Workers Party to its list of terrorist organisations.
That means any involvement in recruitment, training, funding or other form of association with the group is a criminal offence.
Also Wednesday, the European Parliament announced that a five-member delegation led by the rapporteur for Turkey, Camiel Eurlings, would be sent to monitor the trial of Orhan Pamuk, scheduled to begin on Friday.
Pamuk faces criminal charges over remarks concerning mass killings of Armenians in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire.

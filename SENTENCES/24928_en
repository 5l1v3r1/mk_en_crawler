BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic on Tuesday (December 30th) dismissed army chief General Zdravko Ponos, who criticised Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac for lacking a clear defence strategy, media reported. 
"The president has used his constitutional powers to command the army and appoint, dismiss and promote officers," Tadic's office said in a brief statement. 
Ponos' replacement will be his former deputy, General Miloje Miletic, until Tadic names a permanent army chief. 
The statement gave no reason for the dismissal, but media reports suggest a linkage to a conflict between Ponos and Sutanovac, who is an ally of Tadic.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski told UN mediator Matthew Nimetz on Thursday (April 17th) that Macedonia is ready to resume talks aimed at settling its bitter name dispute with Greece. 
"I have been assured at both meetings that state leadership is committed to resuming the negotiations," Nimetz told reporters. 
Though pleased that the government is ready to tackle the issue ahead of early elections, scheduled for June 1st, Nimetz said he has no new proposal to make.
Welcoming German counterpart Horst Koehler to Skopje on Thursday, Crvenkovski told him Macedonia is prepared to compromise regarding the name dispute. 
"We are ready for the sake of the future of this country to pay some price but not any price," Crvenkovski said. 
Delay is not an option either, he said, acknowledging that the longer the dispute drags on, the worse for Macedonia. 
It already cost the country an invitation to NATO membership, earlier this month. 
For his part, Koehler called on Athens to compromise as well. 
Nimetz travels there on Friday to continue his consultations.

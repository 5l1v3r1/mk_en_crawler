BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's Institute for Missing Persons says it will work this year to engage all relevant state institutions in the process of searching for those still missing since the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Institute official Milan Bogdanic said on Thursday (January 3rd) that until now, co-operation among the State Investigation and Protection Agency, prosecutors and police has been unsatisfactory. 
He expressed hope this would change this year.

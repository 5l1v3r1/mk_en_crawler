BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- NATO's commander for Southeast Europe assured Belgrade officials Monday (24 January) that the Alliance is committed to bringing stability and security to Kosovo.
"You have my commitment to continue ...
to work very hard for a safe and secure environment for the people in Kosovo," Admiral Michael G. Mullen told Serbian President Boris Tadic during top-level talks on security, defence refoms and the state union's aspirations to join NATO.
Mullen welcomed the defence reforms that are already under way, but noted that war crimes co-operation remains the key requirement for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.

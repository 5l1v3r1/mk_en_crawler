BUCHAREST, Romania -- Voters will cast ballots on the referendum on the majority voting system and the European Parliament (EP) elections at the same polling stations, though in different areas, if the two events are held on the same day -- November 25th, the government decided on Wednesday (October 31st).
President Traian Basescu had asked that voters be allowed to cast ballots for both in the same location.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu disagrees, saying the referendum and the EP elections are completely separate and should be treated as such.
Interior Minister Cristian David explained that wherever possible, both votes will be organised in the same voting sections, but using different stamps.

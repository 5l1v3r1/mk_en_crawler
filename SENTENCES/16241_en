SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) issued a statement on Tuesday (November 14th) reiterating that any further delay in crucial police reform would have negative consequences on BiH citizens.
The statement stressed that BiH convinced the EU to open talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement by reaching a police reform deal in October 2005.
Republika Srpska has since thwarted further progress on the issue.
Separately Tuesday, BIH chief negotiator with the EU Igor Davidovic said technical negotiations on closing the SAA have entered their final phase.
Dirk Lange, head of the BiH unit of the EU's Western Balkans directorate, agreed that this part of the talks could be completed by year's end.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A man was killed Sunday (18 April) while resisting efforts by Bosnian Serb police to arrest two war crimes indictees in the town of Visegrad.
A police spokesman identified the two suspects as L.M.
and L.S.
and the person killed as L.N.
Reuters reported that the fugitives were cousins Sredoje Lukic and Milan Lukic.
Milan's brother Novica was apparently shot dead by police.
The two suspects were indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for the murders of 150 Muslims in Visegrad in 1992.
Republika Srpska has made no arrests of war crimes indictees to date.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's Foreign Ministry on Sunday (November 16th) denied Greek allegations that a Turkish petroleum company is exploring for oil along the Greek continental shelf in the southern Aegean Sea.
On Saturday, Greece protested the presence of a Norwegian-flagged oil research vessel escorted by a Turkish frigate in an area that, according to Athens, is in Greek territorial waters.
Turkish officials, however, says the research area is under Turkish authority.
Following Greece's protest, the vessel stopped its activities, Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos said.

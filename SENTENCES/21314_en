ANKARA, Turkey -- Direct talks between leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities -- set to begin in June -- are likely the last chance to resolve the decades-old Cyprus problem, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat said on Thursday night (April 24th).
In a speech to the Centre for Eurasian Strategic Studies in Ankara, he said that Turkish Cypriots remain optimistic and would do whatever it takes to reach a solution.
"Once the negotiations begin in late June, it will be very difficult for both sides to stand up and leave the negotiating table," he said, vowing that Turkish Cypriots would keep working to re-unify the divided island.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Transparency International published its annual report on corruption in Romania Wednesday (September 23rd), citing serious problems with parliament's activities. 
Transparency International Romania Director Victor Alistar said parliament has strengthened its control over the government through special commissions, rather than permanent committees. 
Furthermore, it has failed to fulfil its main mission -- that of legislative authority. 
More than 90% of all documents adopted by parliament consist of urgent resolutions, Alistar said. 
The document concluded that from June 2008 to this month, the country has witnessed a "serious aggravation of the public transparency climate, marred by the lack of strategic co-ordination regarding legislative and institutional measures".

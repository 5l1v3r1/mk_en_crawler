BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU on Friday (13 December) announced preparations to replace NATO peacekeepers in Macedonia, and eventually also in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), with troops from its new rapid reaction force.
French President Jacques Chirac said the deployment in Macedonia could happen within weeks, following a decision by Turkey to withdraw its reservations about the EU's use of NATO planning and assets.
The move opened the way for an agreement between the EU and NATO, which would result in the replacement of the alliance's 450-troop mission in Macedonia.
The new NATO mission, Allied Harmony, was inaugurated near Skopje on Saturday.
EU leaders also asked security chief Javier Solana to launch negotiations on the possibility of the EU assuming peacekeeping operations in BiH, gradually reducing the US role so Washington can better fight the war on terrorism.

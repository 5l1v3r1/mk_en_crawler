SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) parliament pulled a bill that would reduce wages for public sector employees from its agenda amid pressure by trade unions.
About 2,000 people rallied in downtown Sarajevo against the bill on Tuesday (February 23rd).
Protestors said the government should consult with the unions before deciding on salary cuts;
doing otherwise breaches the collective bargaining agreement, they argued.
Union head Ismet Bajramovic threatened mass protests this spring if parliament adopts the bill.
Earlier this week, lawmakers postponed a vote on other crucial austerity measures that would curb benefits to war veterans and their families due to the lack of a deal with relevant organisations.
Both measures are part of conditions set by the IMF to disburse the next tranche under a 1.2 billion-euro programme for BiH.

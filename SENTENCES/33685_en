PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic told a local TV station on Sunday (7 September) that he would not testify in the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
"I waged all the battles I could against Milosevic and now he is in a position in The Hague to prove what he thinks he should prove, but without my input." The prime minister said he had declined a request by the tribunal to appear as a witness for the prosecution.
Djukanovic served as prime minister of Montenegro and then as president of the republic during the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s.
Florence Hartmann, the war crimes prosecution spokeswoman, said Djukanovic could be subpoenaed if needed.

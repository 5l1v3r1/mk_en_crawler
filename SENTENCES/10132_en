In a rare statement on Thursday (3 June), chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Croatia was now fully co-operating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"Finally, I have come to a Balkan state that is fully co-operating," del Ponte said in Zagreb.
According to Reuters, it was the first time that the UN prosecutor has given such a positive assessment of Croatia's relations with the ICTY.
Speaking to reporters after her meeting with Justice Minister Vesna Skare Ozbolt, del Ponte said the only open issue is the case of retired General Ante Gotovina, which she described as having "a particular importance".
"The international community is watching us.
I hope we will achieve that we have Gotovina in The Hague soon," del Ponte said.
She also said prosecutors would ask the UN tribunal to transfer several important cases to Croatian courts.
Although she did not give specifics, her spokeswoman had said earlier that retired Generals Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac might be tried in their home country.
Both have been indicted for their alleged roles in atrocities against ethnic Serbs during the September 1993 Croatian Army operation in the Medak Pocket.
It is extremely important for Zagreb to prove that it can hold free trials, del Ponte noted.
On 17 June, a two-day summit begins, at which EU leaders are due to decide whether Croatia is to be granted formal EU candidate status -- a stepping stone for opening accession talks with Brussels.
Croatia is hoping to join the EU in 2007.
The EU has set full co-operation with the ICTY as a key condition for Croatia's bid.
The ICTY is to complete all trials by 2008 and appeals by 2010.
On Thursday, del Ponte said five new indictments relating to war crimes during the 1990s Balkan conflicts would be issued by year's end.

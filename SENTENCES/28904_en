ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serbia will seek the extradition of Sretko Kalinic, a member of the Zemun Clan crime gang, who was arrested in Croatia after being shot by another member of the gang. 
Serbian Justice Minister Snezana Malovic said on Wednesday (June 9th) that Belgrade will submit the request as soon as possible. 
Authorities in Zagreb, however, noted that extradition would require changes to the constitution, as Kalinic has Croatian citizenship. 
He was on the run for seven years before being found wounded in Zagreb's outskirts on Tuesday. 
In 2007, he was convicted of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's murder and sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison. 
Police say Kalinic was shot by fellow Zemun clan member Milos Simovic, who was also sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison. 
Serbian police arrested him early Thursday as he tried to cross the Croatian-Serbian border illegally.

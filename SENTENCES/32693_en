BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said Thursday (19 December) that the UN war crimes tribunal cannot be allowed full access to all archives that might be pertinent to indictee cases.
Svilanovic, who is also the chairman of the Yugoslav council for co-operation on war crimes, asserted that requests for individual documents are decided on a case-by-case basis and full access cannot be granted.
The comments were made in reaction to statements by tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann, who said that Yugoslavia is not doing a good job at co-operating on war crimes.

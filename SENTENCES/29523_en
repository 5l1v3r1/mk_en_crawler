TIRANA, Albania -- The government delivered a report outlining the country's progress in meeting the criteria for visa liberalisation to the European Commission (EC).
Sources within the foreign ministry confirmed on Tuesday (August 31st) that the document was drafted after an evaluation by an EU fact-finding mission to Albania, conducted earlier this summer.
Sources say the process of repatriation is one issue that dominates the report.
The European Parliament will decide whether to lift visa restrictions on Albania at a session this month.
Albania expects the EU interior ministers to offer a positive evaluation of the process in November.

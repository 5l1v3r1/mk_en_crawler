BUCHAREST, Romania -- Bucharest mayor Sorin Oprescu announced on Monday (October 5th) that he will stand for president at the forthcoming elections on November 22nd. 
Oprescu will not seek endorsement by any party, given his past as senior member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). 
He left the party last year, and won the Bucharest city hall election as an independent candidate in June 2008. 
Oprescu has been rumoured to enter the race for a long time, given that he is relatively popular, and may draw votes not only from the PSD, but from a much broader voter base. 
Oprescu has been often compared to Traian Basescu, the president, maintaining a similar, a-man-of-the-people style.
Meanwhile, another presidential candidate -- PSD leader Mircea Geoana -- announced Monday that his party is open to support a no-confidence vote against their former partners in the ruling coalition -- the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL). 
National Liberal Party (PNL) leader Crin Antonescu already announced last week that the party would launch a vote of no confidence against the cabinet.
The PSD left the ruling coalition last week, after President Traian Basescu endorsed the decision of Prime Minister Emil Boc of the PDL to dismiss Interior Minister Dan Nica. 
As a result, PDL's ministers took over temporary the seats left vacant by the PSD.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Members of the National Liberal Party (PNL) are gathering on Friday (March 20th) for a two-day extraordinary congress to elect new leaders. 
Deputy PNL President Crin Antonescu prompted the move by challenging current party President Calin Popescu Tariceanu for failing to join the ruling coalition after the general elections last December. 
The PNL will also select its list of candidates for the European Parliament elections this spring.

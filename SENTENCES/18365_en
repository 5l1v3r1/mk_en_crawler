ATHENS, Greece -- The Acropolis in Athens is closing because of a strike by guards. 
The Greek Union of Keepers of Archaeological Sites announced the walkout on Wednesday (July 11th), demanding more flexible hours. 
It also wants the government to give temporary workers permanent status. 
The union plans to close the Acropolis again during a four-day strike beginning on July 21st. 
Other archaeological sites in Greece would not be affected. 
The planned transfer of massive exhibits to a new Acropolis Museum building began as scheduled on Thursday.
Also Thursday, Bulgarian prosecutors officially asked Greece to return nine 14th-century silver plates that were allegedly smuggled into Greece during the 1990s. 
Bulgaria says the plates are currently displayed in three Greek museums.

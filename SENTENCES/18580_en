OSIJEK, Croatia -- Parliament member Branimir Glavas and other three war crimes indictees have begun a hunger strike, according to the Osijek County Court on Monday (May 7th). 
The four, accused of committing crimes against Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991, have been in custody since mid-April. 
Glavas launched a hunger strike while in custody last autumn, and became so weak the court released him after a month.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Monday (August 3rd) that she expects Slovenia to stop blocking Zagreb's EU accession talks soon.
She added that she hopes discussions she had on Friday with Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor will lead to results.
The two prime ministers agreed on a framework plan to resolve their countries' longstanding border dispute by the end of 2009, but no details were revealed.
Kosor refused to comment on a report by the Nacional weekly suggesting that Croatia would withdraw controversial documents on the bilateral border issue to make Slovenia end its blockade.
Slovenia argues that documents Zagreb has submitted to Brussels, including maps of their disputed common sea and land boundaries, could prejudge a settlement to the border dispute.
Slovenia has been blocking Croatia's accession bid since December.

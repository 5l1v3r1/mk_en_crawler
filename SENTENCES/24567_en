SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic arrived on Thursday (May 7th) for an official visit to Skopje, the first by a Serbian official since Macedonia recognised Kosovo's independence and Belgrade recalled its ambassador to Skopje last October. 
Jeremic is scheduled to meet with outgoing President Branko Crvenkovski -- whose mandate ends in less than a week, Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki. 
Discussions are expected to focus on bilateral co-operation and the possibilities of opening new border checkpoints, as well as regional issues.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Eight people were injured in a shootout late Thursday (July 3rd) in Radusha, a predominantly ethnic Albanian village.
Police spokesman Ivo Kotevski said on Thursday the police suspect political motives.
He added that two of the people, including Besford Aliti -- the 25-year-old son of Rafiz Aliti, a senior official in the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration -- are still in critical condition.
Gunfire wounded one of the suspected attackers as well, whom police arrested in a hospital in Skopje.
Police continue to search for four other suspects, all members of the same family, Kotevski said.

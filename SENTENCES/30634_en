TIRANA, Albania -- OSCE Ambassador in Albania Eugen Wollfarth offered full support to President Bamir Topi's effort to push ahead with plans for the upcoming local elections. 
"Albanian citizens will be able to exercise their right to vote on May 8th," Wollfarth said after meeting with Topi on Monday (February 14th). 
The Central Election Commission is waiting for the opposition Socialist Party, which has already missed one deadline, to nominate its commissioners for the elections. 
The new deadline is Saturday.

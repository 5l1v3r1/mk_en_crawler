SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The multiparty commission established to revise eligible voters' lists holds its first session Monday (23 January).
The cabinet decided to form the panel last week ahead of parliamentary elections later this year.
The opposition says some 100,000 bogus names must be removed from the rolls.
In other news, a new project kicks off Monday aimed at improving municipal services through competition.
The top three agencies providing the best public service to constituents would receive grants and other incentives worth 250,000 euros, 150,000 euros and 100,000 euros from the EC.

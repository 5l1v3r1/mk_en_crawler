TIRANA, Albania -- Albania's new President Bamir Topi met with opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama on Friday (July 27th). 
Talks focused on reforms needed for EU and NATO integration and other key issues. 
Topi and Rama agreed on the need for constructive dialogue between the presidency and all the political parties in the country. 
They also emphasized the significance of judicial and electoral reforms, decentralization of power and other changes.
Meanwhile, protests against electricity and water restrictions in Albania continued on Saturday. 
The Socialist Movement for Integration, which staged the rallies, said the government was to blame and the prime minister should step down. 
In some parts of Tirana, residents have been subject to power cuts of up to six hours a day, with water available for as little as two hours a day.

TIRANA, Albania -- A UN disaster and assessment co-ordination team (UNDAC) is evaluating the situation in Albania where explosions at an ammunition depot recently killed at least 22 people, the UN said in a statement Sunday (March 23rd).
The seven-member team began an assessment of the affected area last week in collaboration with the Albanian government.
Albanian authorities asked the UNDAC to help identify priority needs and co-ordinate their response to the March 15th blasts, triggered during efforts to destroy old military ordnance in the village of Gerdec.
Helping to find the causes of the blasts will be a team of six FBI experts, who will arrive on Wednesday from the United States, following an official request by General Prosecutor Ina Rama.

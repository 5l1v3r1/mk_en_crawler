THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serge Brammertz, chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY), said on Friday (December 17th) that the court considers it likely that war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic is in Serbia. 
He urged authorities in Belgrade to do everything that can be reasonably expected to bring the fugitive to justice.
"It is clear that the key to apprehending Mladic is in Serbia," Brammertz said in an interview with the Novosti daily, adding that there are many weaknesses in the current effort to catch Mladic. 
He said authorities should make it clear that there is nothing heroic about the atrocities Mladic is suspected of participating in, and that supporting him is a form of misguided patriotism.

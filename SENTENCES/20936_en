TIRANA, Albania -- In an interview with Voice of America on Tuesday (September 4th), Edi Rama, leader of Albania's main opposition Socialist Party (SP), made clear that former leader Fatos Nano is no longer part of the party's new programme.
It was Nano who urged SP lawmakers to break ranks and elect Democratic Party official Bamir Topi president in July.
Nano, who has frequently quarrelled with Rama, says he plans to launch a new political movement.

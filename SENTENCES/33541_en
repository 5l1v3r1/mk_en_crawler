NEW YORK, United States -- Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul arrived in New York Sunday (21 September) to participate in this week's UN General Assembly meeting. 
He indicated that the decision to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq would be made by mid-October, adding that the issue would be discussed at length once parliament resumes work early next month. 
On Friday, the National Security Council met for four hours, but failed to reach a decision on the proposed deployment.
On Saturday, meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
He praised Turkey's investment climate, saying obstacles have been removed and foreign entities should not miss out on flourishing investment opportunities in the country.

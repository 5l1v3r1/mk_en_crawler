ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country's four biggest trade unions announced on Thursday (April 29th) that instead of celebrations to mark May 1st, International Labour Day, they are organising protests in some of the biggest cities.
Saturday's protests against economic instability will be held in Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek and Pula.
Demonstrators will urge the government to halt its policy of job cuts.
Organisers have invited students, the unemployed, pensioners and other members of the public to join the action.

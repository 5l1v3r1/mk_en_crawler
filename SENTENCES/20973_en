ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prosecutors in Istanbul filed charges Tuesday (December 4th) against two of the lawyers representing Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan, accusing them of supporting the terrorist group.
Irfan Dundar and Mahmut Sakar are charged with belonging to an illegal organisation, the banned PKK.
The prosecution wants them jailed for up to 15 years.
In March, the two lawyers published the results of an analysis of Ocalan's hair, which they say proves their client is being poisoned.
Their announcement from Rome led to clashes in heavily Kurdish southeastern Turkey.
In other news, Turkish troops killed six PKK fighters near the border with Iraq, according to a report Tuesday.
A Turkish officer also died in the gunfight that began after the terrorists refused to surrender to an army unit Monday.

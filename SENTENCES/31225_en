PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The International Civilian Office (ICO) welcomed on Wednesday (February 2nd) a government decision to postpone a planned increase in public sector salaries.
ICO spokesperson Andy McGuffie said this opens the path to further talks with the IMF to find options to implement hikes later.
"The ICO's interest â¦ was always for respect of law, and for proper procedures.
And of course, respect of principles of good budget management," McGuffie said.
The outgoing government made a campaign promise in early December to raise salaries in the public sector by 30% to 50%, a move affecting about 70,000 workers.

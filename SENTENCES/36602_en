ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament's General Assembly approved on Tuesday (4 May) the constitutional amendments package submitted by the government last week.
A final vote is scheduled for Friday.
The package provides for changes in line with EU regulations, including abolition of the death penalty and annulment of the State Security Courts.
In other news, Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu insisted Tuesday that there are no further threats to next month's NATO summit in Istanbul.
Earlier this week, authorities announced they thwarted a terrorist plot aimed at the summit and arrested nine suspected members of the Iraq-based radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam.

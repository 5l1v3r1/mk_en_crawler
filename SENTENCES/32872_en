THESSALONIKI, Greece -- In an interview with the Thessaloniki-based Epsilon magazine Sunday (1 December), European Commission President Romano Prodi said the EU can no longer delay the accession of Cyprus.
Noting that the Union would prefer to admit the island united, he acknowledged reunification is not likely soon, and that the EU was ready to invite Cyprus divided.
Greece has advocated accession, despite the existing separation between the Greek-inhabited part of the island and the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", and has threatened to block the EU enlargement process altogether if Cyprus is not admitted.

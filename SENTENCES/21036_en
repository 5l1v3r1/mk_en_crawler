ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Three people were injured when a garbage bin exploded in Istanbul on Wednesday (January 2nd). 
The blast occurred in the Kucukcekmece district, near the site of a blast last week that killed a woman. 
A day earlier, police in Istanbul arrested a 25-year-old man as he tried to enter the subway with a backpack full of explosives. 
Turkish media reports suggest he had undergone military training at a terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party camp in northern Iraq. 
Security measures in Istanbul have been stepped up for the Muslim and Christian holidays.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Authorities completed on Tuesday (May 19th) the extradition of a Kosovo citizen, identified only as S.Z., from Switzerland, the first such case handled by local institutions since UNMIK handed over this task to the justice ministry. 
The arrest stemmed from an international warrant issued by Mitrovica's district court.
In other news Tuesday, Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, praised the EU's mission, EULEX, for maintaining "a good security situation" in Kosovo. 
"Our efforts ... 
are already giving positive results," Gallach said.
Also Tuesday, both Bahrain and the Comoro Islands recognised Kosovo as an independent state, bringing the number of official recognitions to 60, media reported. 
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008.

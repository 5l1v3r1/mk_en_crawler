SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite BiH Presidency strongly denounced the violation of UN resolutions by the Bijeljina-based Orao company, which sold weaponry to Iraq.
At a special session Wednesday (26 March) devoted to the Orao affair, the presidency called on the governments of both entities -- Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH (FBiH) -- to intensify investigations of other alleged violations.
Recent reports suggest that companies in FBiH might have also had illegal trade with Iraq.
The presidency also agreed on the need to establish state-level authorities for supervision.
Serb member Mirko Sarovic reiterated that he had no involvement in the Orao affair, amid rumours the international community may remove him from the presidency.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK has still not received any instructions from the UN about transferring power to EULEX, the EU's new police and judicial mission in Kosovo.
UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko told the Serbian news agency Tanjug on Saturday (May 17th) that UNMIK and EULEX represent two separate missions in Kosovo, and that talks are under way between the UN and EU on the future role of their missions.
Separately, EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon told AFP on Friday that the mission has stalled over the lack of a clear political framework.

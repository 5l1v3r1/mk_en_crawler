PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Integrating the Serb minority remains the chief challenge facing Kosovo more than a year after Pristina declared its independence, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said in a report Tuesday (May 12th).
According to the document, Belgrade has channelled substantial funds into Serb municipalities, but with limited results.
Parallel structures, it said, are not able to meet the needs of residents.
The report noted efforts by the Kosovo government and international community to involve Serbs in the Kosovo institutions and to convince them they have a future in an independent Kosovo.

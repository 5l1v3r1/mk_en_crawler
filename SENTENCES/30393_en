BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgaria and Romania probably won't get a "green light" to enter Schengen in March.
This became clear after a meeting of a working group of experts in Brussels on Friday (January 14th) to discuss the two countries' readiness to join the border-free zone.
Bulgaria's biggest problem, according to experts who inspected the country in December, is control on its border with Turkey.
Staff shortages and poor equipment as well as the lack of fixed observation posts are contributing to the problem, they said.
A new EU mission will be sent over to evaluate progress in the situation in March.
On Romania, meanwhile, a decision was taken to further examine the implementation of the Schengen Information System's human interface.
The next meeting of the expert group will probably be held on January 28th.

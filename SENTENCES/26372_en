SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov confirmed on Monday (March 15th) that the government has dropped the idea of raising health insurance contributions. 
Instead, it will back an alternative, by which the state will no longer cover social and health contributions for civil servants, effective April 1st. 
The measure is expected to cut expenses by around 70m euros, which will go towards the health care budget. 
Dyankov added that he personally opposes using part of the health insurance fund's reserve to provide more resources for health care, saying it will add to the budget deficit.

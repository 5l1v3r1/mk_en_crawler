BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Finland, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, described Turkey's offer to open one port and one airport to Greek Cypriot traffic as not enough to comply with obligations under the 2005 extended customs union with the EU. 
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said Friday (December 8th) that he expects the EU Council to endorse the European Commission's recommendation for a partial freeze of Turkey's EU membership talks, during a session this week.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, lobbied for support of the proposal from US President George W. 
Bush and Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, during separate phone conversations Friday.

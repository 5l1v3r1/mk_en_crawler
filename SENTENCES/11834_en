THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb Lieutenant Drago Nikolic, 47, surrendered to the UN tribunal on Thursday (17 March) to face charges in connection with the Srebrenica massacre.
He is the seventh Serb indictee to give himself up to the court since the beginning of January.
Also Thursday, former Bosnian Serb military police commander Mico Stanisic, who later became Republika Srpska's interior minister, pleaded not guilty to allegations that he took part in the extermination, murder and torture of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in the early 1990s.
He surrendered a week ago.
Meanwhile, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said the government would soon freeze the assets of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, one of the tribunal's three most-wanted indictees.

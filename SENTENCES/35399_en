SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic, leader of the Bosnian Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA), ruled out possible changes to the BiH cabinet on Friday (13 February). 
Tihic, who is also a member of the BiH presidency, cited differences among coalition partners. 
The Party for BiH opposed the reshuffle, while the Croatian Democratic Union agreed only on the replacement of Prime Minister Ahmet Hadzipasic, which the SDA rejected.
In other news, SFOR announced Friday that it had released Dusan Tesic, a Bosnian Serb police officer detained in January for suspected links to war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic. 
A second Bosnian Serb policeman, Zeljko Jankovic, remains in custody.

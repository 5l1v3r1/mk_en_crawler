HELSINKI, Finland -- Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, whose country took over the EU's rotating presidency on Saturday (1 July), said the Union must continue with its eastward expansion. 
In a statement clearly geared to several candidates from the Balkans, he said all "European countries which share European values with us and meet all the criteria for membership must have the possibility of joining the Union". 
Vanhanen added, however, that accession talks with Ankara could be halted in the autumn if Ankara fails to open its seaports and airports to traffic from Cyprus.

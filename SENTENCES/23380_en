SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko assumed the post of high representative in BiH on Thursday (March 26th), thus becoming the seventh since 1996.
Inzko replaced Miroslav Lajcak, who left to become foreign minister of Slovakia.
The new high representative said he will follow the priorities set by the international community, namely speeding up reforms necessary for the country's EU integration.
He added that a possible decision to close down the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and transform it into the office of the EU Special Representative will depend on those reforms.
He also said he will not hesitate to use the so-called Bonn powers that allow him to enact laws or dismiss politicians if the need arises.
In other news, BiH Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said Thursday his country will apply for EU candidate status in next November or December.
Alkalaj expressed regret that the EU is now less willing to accept new members because of internal problems.
"It's vital for us not to fall behind," the minister stressed.

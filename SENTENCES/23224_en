SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski warned on Thursday (July 31st) the EU would not schedule a date to start accession negotiations with Macedonia if opposition parties do not return to parliament.
"With such an ineffective parliament and half-democracy in Macedonia, the European Commission will not recommend the start of accession talks," Crvenkovski said.
The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), the Liberal Democratic Party, the New Social Democratic Party and the New Alternative party, all members of the Sun coalition, decided to boycott parliament sessions after the arrest of SDSM Vice President and Strumica Mayor Zoran Zaev.
He allegedly abused his power in a tender for a local shopping mall.
Crvenkovski said he is ready to pardon Zaev and to mediate among political parties to help end the crisis.

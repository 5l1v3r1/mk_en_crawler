SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two of the main political parties in BiH -- the Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) and the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) -- are expected to hold negotiations Monday (15 March), after HDZ announced Friday that it has ended its partnership with SDA.
The two parties, together with the Serb Democratic Party, are members of the coalition government.
HDZ leader Barisa Colak, who is the incumbent state security minister, attributed the split to differences over reforms.
He also accused the SDA of attempting to dominate Croats.
In other news, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) said Saturday that it disapproved of Relja Kovac's new appointment as head of the BiH State Border Service.
The OHR said the appointment was politically motivated.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will brief the EU on progress Croatia has made in regards to war crimes co-operation in early September, the newspaper Vjesnik reported Friday (19 August), citing diplomatic sources.
Crucial to a positive report would be evidence that Croatia is breaking the network supporting war crimes fugitive Ante Gotovina.
Zagreb's failure to hand over Gotovina has led to an ongoing delay in its EU bid.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament endorsed on Friday (January 26th) in the second reading a package of constitutional amendments related to Bulgaria's EU accession.
The changes mainly apply to the judiciary and military.
The presidents of the two supreme courts and the chief prosecutor would no longer have to report to the legislature, thus reducing the opportunity for political intererence.
Compulsory military service, meanwhile, would be replaced by a fully professional army as of 2008.
The changes must be approved by Parliament in the third reading.
The next session is scheduled for Wednesday.

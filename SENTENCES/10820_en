ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer sent a message to US counterpart George W. Bush on Thursday (4 November), congratulating him on his re-election and vowing to support the US-led war on terror, which he said was aimed at "cementing peace and security in a vast geography".
For his part, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the two countries would work together in "the struggle against terrorism, but on behalf of trans-Atlantic co-operation, regional stability and the establishment of harmony between civilisations".
In other news Thursday, parliament passed legislation that would make it easier for non-Muslim associations to register in Turkey.
The new law also sets up a judiciary police force and amends criminal procedure rules.
The amendments address concerns outlined in last month's EU progress report on Turkey.

TIRANA, Albania -- Former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu on Tuesday (August 26th) failed to appear at the prosecutor's office where he was to answer questions regarding the deadly March 15th ammunition explosions in Gerdec.
His lawyer says Mediu was visiting the United States for personal reasons.
The prosecutor postponed the session until September.
In June, Mediu lost his immunity from prosecution after heated debates in parliament.
That allowed prosecutors to investigate his role in the Gerdec blasts, which killed 26 people.
Also Tuesday, the ministry of the environment confirmed at a press conference that water in the area around Gerdec remains contaminated.
The air however, is considered safe.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor will meet with Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor on Friday (September 11th) in Ljubljana to discuss a possible solution to the long-standing bilateral border dispute. 
In an interview Thursday with Austrian radio ORF, Kosor said the row could be resolved by year's end and Croatia could close its EU accession talks by the first half of 2010. 
Local media have speculated that Zagreb will withdraw controversial documents on the border issue to make Slovenia end its blockade of Zagreb's accession bid.

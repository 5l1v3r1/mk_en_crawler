ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) held a summit at the weekend, to plan for next year's parliamentary elections.
Talking to reporters Sunday (3 September), SDP leader Ivica Racan said the meeting resulted in the appointment of election staff and campaign co-ordinators.
He added that the focus would be what SDP would do to ensure better living standards and boost efforts against crime and corruption, rather than solely attacking the incumbent Croatian Democratic Union.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Saturday (April 19th) that he expects Montenegro to recognise Kosovo's independence soon. 
"Montenegro is not being indecisive over the recognition of Kosovo's independence. 
I am convinced this will happen in the near future," Thaci told the MINA news agency. 
He added that the most important goal of Kosovo is to establish good relations with Montenegro. 
Asked about the protests by Montenegrins living in Kosovo over the fact that they were not mentioned in the constitution, Thaci said "Article Three ... 
says that Kosovo is a multi-ethnic society, made up of Albanians and other communities. 
This means the constitution treats all communities living in Kosovo equally." (Makfax, Mina, BBC - 19/04/08)

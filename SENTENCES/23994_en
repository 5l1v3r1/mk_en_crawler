TIRANA, Albania -- The newly adopted lustration law, passed by parliament last month, is causing problems, local media reported on Sunday (January 18th).
The law requires all officials to undergo investigation to determine whether they co-operated with the secret police during the communist regime.
The main opposition Socialist Party is threatening to challenge the bill before the Constitutional Court, while the ruling Democratic Party (DP) says any such ruling would amount to a conflict of interest.
On Sunday, DP lawmaker Aldo Bumci defended the bill, saying it complies with the principle of legal ethics, which applies in all European constitutions.
But on Friday, Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary-General Terry Davis said the lustration law does not fully comply with the CoE standards of democracy.

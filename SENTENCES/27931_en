ATHENS, Greece -- Thousands of public workers staged a fresh protest in Athens on Friday (November 19th) after the government announced a final 2011 budget draft envisioning additional tax hikes and state cost cuts.
The crowd of workers in the local administration and the public electricity company marched to the interior and environment ministries' buildings in the capital, chanting slogans against the austerity measures, which are expected to result in at least 10,000 job cuts in the public sector.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece celebrated its "Okhi" holiday on Sunday (October 28th). 
In 1940, Greek General Ioannis Metaxas responded to an Italian ultimatum -- demanding that Greece allow Italian forces to use its territory for military operations -- with the word "okhi" ("no" in Greek). 
Italy then attacked Greece. 
Many Greek peasants joined the army, fighting for months and eventually pushing the Italians back.

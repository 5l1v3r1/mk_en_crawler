BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government on Tuesday (15 November) adopted a draft resolution that opposes independence for Kosovo.
The document calls for a compromise with the ethnic Albanian majority during the upcoming status talks, while terming the province an "inalienable" part of Serbia.
President Boris Tadic defended the stance Tuesday during talks in Moscow.
He warned that Kosovo demands for full independence could lead to destabilisation.
In other news, a new poll finds the Serbian public is changing its attitudes towards fugitive war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic.
The survey by Prime Communication agency found that 51.1 per cent of those polled believe that Karadzic should be extradited to The Hague, while 48.9 per cent say that he should not be arrested.
More than 70 per cent said Karadzic should turn himself in.

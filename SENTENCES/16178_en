ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said on Wednesday (17 May) that the murder of a top administrative judge, Mustafa Yucel Ozbilgin, and the wounding of several other Council of State members was a direct attack against secularism and the republic.
Democracy and the secular character of the state are irreversible, he added.
Police say a 28-year-old lawyer opened fire Wednesday in retaliation for a court decision upholding a ban on Islamic scarves in secular establishments.
Opposition leader Deniz Baykal called the killings an attack against the Turkish Constitution.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also denounced the attack.

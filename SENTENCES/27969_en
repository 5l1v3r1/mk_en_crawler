TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi on Tuesday (May 18th) again urged both the government and the opposition to demonstrate the willingness to resolve the ongoing political stalemate. 
His comment follows a week of speculation that an agreement to end the stalemate had been suggested and then rejected by the sides. 
Topi stressed that the key to success is political dialogue. 
He reiterated that the legal framework is in place, starting with the Constitutional Court and ending with the Venice Commission. 
Members and supporters of the opposition Socialist Party have camped along Tirana's main boulevard since April 30th, staging a hunger strike. 
They are demanding transparency regarding the June 2009 elections, which they argue were marred by numerous violations. 
The government denies the claims.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias said on Thursday (October 1st) that he will not accept any mediation or strict timeframes for reunifying the divided island. 
Speaking at a military parade in Nicosia, marking the 49th anniversary of the country's independence, Christofias said this message "goes to every direction, including to the UN secretariat". 
Asked to comment on a statement by Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, who said that the delay in talks opens a window for mediation, Christofias said that Talat could instead avoid delays.

ATHENS, Greece -- The country's two biggest trade unions, GSEE and ADEDY A, are staging a 24-hour strike Tuesday (May 15th), involving employees in the state and municipal administration, schools, public transportation in Athens, the national flag carrier Olympic Airlines, and the media.
They are seeking compensation over the so-called pension funds' affair, involving the sale of allegedly overpriced bonds by the Labour Ministry to state pension funds.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In the November referendum on the controversial power decentralisation law package, Macedonia faces the last and most difficult phase in implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, President Branko Crvenkovski said Thursday (30 September). 
During an international conference in Skopje, he rejected the claims of some parties and politicians that a successful referendum will lead to new fighting, saying the government would not allow it.
On Friday meanwhile, European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi was in Skopje to present the lengthy EC questionnaire. 
It covers the political and economic criteria for EU membership as well as questions related to domestic legislation.

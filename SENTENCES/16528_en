ANKARA, Turkey -- The government announced on Thursday (11 May) that it is preparing to pass new legislation aimed at harmonising the military's judicial system with EU standards. 
Capital punishment will be banned, even in wartime. 
Capital punishment during peacetime was abolished in 2002, as a move towards EU membership. 
In 2004, a constitutional amendment was approved in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. 
The new legislation adds restrictions to military courts prosecuting civilians. 
Certain privileges enjoyed by military courts will be removed, in accordance with EU standards.
In other news, another bomb was thrown at the office of Cumhuriyet, an opposition newspaper, in Istanbul on Thursday. 
No casualties were reported. 
It was the third attack in a week against the paper.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro wants to be admitted to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said during a meeting with British Minister for Europe Denis MacShane in London on Wednesday (21 April).
Labus said membership in the programme "would significantly stabilise political tensions and help countries draw nearer to the EU".
Belgrade hopes to enter the initiative, considered a key step towards NATO integration, during the June summit in Istanbul.
However, its record on war crimes co-operation is seen as a major obstacle.

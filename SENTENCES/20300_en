ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's largest business group, the Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD), is urging the government to speed up the reform process and keep the EU membership bid afloat, despite opposition from certain EU countries. 
At a session Thursday (December 13th), TUSIAD chairperson Arzuhan Dogan YalcÄ±ndag warned, "We have almost dropped the EU project off the table." It was the association's strongest statement to the government in months.
Economy Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Nazim Ekren responded by urging the TUSIAD to be more aggressive in fighting the shadow economy. 
He proposed the signing of a protocol by representatives of the public and private sectors and civil society organisations stipulating that the government will ease their tax burdens in exchange for efforts to reduce the size of the grey area.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Gjorge Ivanov voiced expectations on Tuesday (October 6th) that the process of resolving the long-standing name dispute with Greece will receive a new impetus, given the new government in Athens. 
He said a compromise is possible, if the process continues under the auspices of UN resolutions and talks focus only on the name, and not on the Macedonian identity and language. 
Ivanov added any compromise shouldn't "be offensive" to either Macedonia or Greece.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Foreign Minister Milan Rocen said on Tuesday (June 1st) that Montenegro has not received an extradition request from Bangkok regarding former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
Nor, Rocen said, have Thai authorities sent any documents or evidence regarding the case.
He was responding to media reports suggesting Bangkok has asked Podgorica to arrest Shinawatra.
He holds a Montenegrin passport and is suspected of involvement in recent anti-government street protests in Bangkok that left more than 80 people dead.

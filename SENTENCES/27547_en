ANKARA, Turkey -- Chief of General Staff, General Ilker Basbug, handed over his post to Land Forces Commander General Isik Kosaner at a ceremony Friday (August 27th).
Basbug is to retire on Monday.
Kosaner, known as a quiet and hard-line secularist, will hold the post for the next three years.
"The Turkish Armed Forces have always taken sides and will take sides in defending the unitary state and secularism," Kosaner said during the ceremony.

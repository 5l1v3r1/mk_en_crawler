TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), said on Wednesday (15 February) that the DP is willing to consult with all political parties, including the main opposition Socialist Party, about next year's presidential elections.
Analysts say he is implying the possible nomination of another candidate with broad political support of the kind Alfred Moisiu received in 2002.

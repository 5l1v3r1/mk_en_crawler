SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Seven high-level military officials demanded on Saturday (March 7th) that local authorities oppose arrest warrants issued by Belgrade for 19 people in BiH over alleged war crimes in Sarajevo. 
The officials said some renowned names were among those 19, which could lead to regional destabilisation. 
On February 26th, Serbia's interior ministry confirmed the warrants stemmed from 1992 war crimes.

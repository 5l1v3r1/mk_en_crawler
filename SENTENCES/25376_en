ATHENS, Greece -- President Karolos Papoulias declined his Macedonian counterpart's invitation for a visit on Tuesday (December 22nd), saying such a trip would be possible only after the name dispute between the two countries is resolved. 
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov had extended the invitation early last month. 
In his response Tuesday, Papoulias wrote "I do not wish to suggest what would be in the interest of your countryâ€¦ [but] a solution to the name issue will prove beneficial for the legitimate aspirations of your people."
"I ought to highlight that the longer it takes for a solution, the longer the accession course of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia towards the EU will remain pending," the Greek head of state added.(Makfax, A1, MIA, ANA-MPA - 22/12/09)

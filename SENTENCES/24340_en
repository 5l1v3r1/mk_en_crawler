BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed disappointment on Wednesday (March 11th) that although Macedonia had been an EU candidate for three years, it had not yet launched accession negotiations. 
Speaking at a session of the European Parliament on Croatia, Turkey and Macedonia's EU aspirations, Rehn pointed out that a key prerequisite for launching talks was implementing international standards for free and fair elections. 
"This is a core requirement. 
The presidential and municipal elections in March and April will be a moment of truth," Rehn said.
He also commented on Croatia and Turkey's EU talks. 
"From a general perspective, accession negotiations with Croatia have generally been going well. 
This is why the Commission proposed in November 2008 an indicative road map to reach the final stage of accession negotiations by the end of 2009, provided Croatia fulfils the conditions. 
Unfortunately, accession negotiations with Croatia are now stalled because of the border issue [with Slovenia]," Rehn said. 
He added that Croatia should make more effort in several key areas, such as judicial and administrative reform and its fight against corruption and organised crime.
Commenting on Turkey's progress, Rehn said the negotiating process had been opened on ten of the 35 chapters, with negotiators closing one of them. 
He expressed hope that the EU Council would give a green light this year to open and close more chapters if Ankara implemented the necessary reforms in key areas.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The international community on Friday (March 9th) welcomed the meeting between Prime Minister and VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski and Ali Ahmeti, the head of the main ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
According to a joint statement issued by the EU, OSCE, NATO and US envoys in Skopje, the meeting represented an important step toward confidence building.
The Western envoys also encouraged all political formations in Macedonia to continue efforts for a viable political dialogue.
Also on Friday, EU envoy Erwan Fouere again urged VMRO-DPMNE and DUI to reach an agreement on the list of laws that should be adopted under the so-called Badinter principle.
Such laws require approval by a majority of minority party deputies in order to be adopted by Parliament.

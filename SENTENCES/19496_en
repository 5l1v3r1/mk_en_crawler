SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, who resigned at the beginning of the month, promised on Saturday (November 24th) to convene the country's Council of Ministers (CoM) shortly, but declined to name an exact date. 
Last week, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak criticised Spiric because the CoM has not met since October 16th. 
Spiric says it is not clear under which rules the cabinet should operate, a reference to changes Lajcak imposed recently to the quorum laws governing votes by the CoM and the BiH parliament. 
Those rule changes prompted Spiric to resign. 
He says they would only further complicate the work of the state-level cabinet.

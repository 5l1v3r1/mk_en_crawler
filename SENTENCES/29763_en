ATHENS, Greece -- Rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) on Tuesday (March 29th) cut Greece's credit rating by two notches from BB+ to BB-, citing concerns the country may be forced to seek more bailout money, apart from the 110 billion euros it received from the IMF and the EU in May 2010. 
S&P says the government is struggling to meet the targets under the bailout loan. 
Prime Minister George Papandreou reacted, saying the austerity measures are working and no additional rescue funds would be necessary. 
The Finance Ministry slammed S&P's move as "unbalanced and unjust". 
Greece has repeatedly criticised the policy of rating agencies as biased
Meanwhile, a wave of fresh strikes against the government-imposed austerity measures continued on Wednesday with teachers and professors joining the action. 
Hospital workers and doctors are protesting health care spending cuts. 
Public transport in Athens plans stoppages and the Hellenic Bar Association announced that its workers will stay off the job through Friday, protesting a government proposal to open the sector to foreign competition. 
The two biggest labour unions, GSEE and ADEDY, are organising a 24-hour general strike Thursday that will paralyse the entire country.

ATHENS, Greece -- Protesting farmers blocked on Saturday (January 16th) several sections of highways in the country in a protest demanding secure subsidies, guaranteed buy-out prices of their produce, lower production costs and freeze of their bank credits. 
Blockades were set up 90km and 120km north of Athens, as well as 70km and 140km south of Thessaloniki. 
Trade unions said they would block border checkpoints with Bulgaria and Macedonia on Monday.

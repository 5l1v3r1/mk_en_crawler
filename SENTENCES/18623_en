BUCHAREST, Romania -- A court has granted parole to the leader of a Romanian miners' revolt, which led to the toppling of the country's first post-communist government.
Miron Cozma was serving a ten-year sentence for leading thousands of miners into Bucharest, where they seized buildings, including parliament.
Three people were killed and dozens injured during three days in which miners beat up supporters of the reformist government.
Cozma led several other similar raids on the capital.
His sentence was due to end in ten months.

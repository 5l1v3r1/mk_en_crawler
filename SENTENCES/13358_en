PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK Police Commissioner Kai Vittrup said Thursday (30 March) that the police arrested two ethnic Albanian teenagers, both under 18, in a stabbing case in Mitrovica. 
Miloslav Ilincic, a 19-year-old Kosovo Serb, was injured in the 28 March attack. 
Vittrup said the incident happened when a fight broke out after an argument. 
Ethnicity was not a motive, he added.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko on Tuesday (December 15th) downplayed concerns about Republika Srpska (RS) holding a referendum on his decision to extend the mandate of foreign judges and prosecutors working in BiH's Court. 
In an interview with Dnevni Avaz, Inzko said he is convinced that RS will not organise any referendum and insisted his actions were neutral, moderate and only aimed at reinstating the rule of law. 
Under Inzko's decision, foreign judges and prosecutors will continue to work only on war crimes cases until 2012, while those in charge of corruption, organised crime and terrorism will become advisers to domestic staff. 
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has said his entity's parliament will reject Inzko's resolution and may approve a referendum on it.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Serbian court on Friday (15 July) convicted four former Serbian paramilitary militia members for the murders of 16 Muslims in 1992. 
The victims, including one woman, were taken off a bus in Serbia as they travelled to work in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
They were tortured and then executed. 
No bodies have been recovered, but the authorities based their case on photos taken by the militiamen. 
Two of the defendants were given 10 and 20 years in prison, respectively. 
The other two, Milan Lukic and Oliver Krsmanovic, were tried in absentia and received 20-year sentences. 
Lukic is also one of the UN tribunal's most wanted suspects.

ST PETERSBURG, Russia -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who also serves as European Council president, dismissed allegations by Russia on Saturday (31 May) that a "Chinese Wall" was being built around the EU. 
At the EU-Russia summit in St Petersburg, Russian President Vladimir Putin complained about the strictness of the Schengen system. 
In response, Simitis said the issue of free movement was directly linked to security. 
He added that major problems with drugs and human trafficking must be resolved before restrictions on free movement could be lifted.

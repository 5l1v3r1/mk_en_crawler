PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Jean Caddy, the top police and judiciary official at the UN mission in Pristina, told the local assembly on Thursday (23 January) that crime rates in the province dropped significantly in 2002.
According to the UN, there were 68 murders last year, compared to 245 in 2000, and the figures showed a strong decline in ethnically-motivated hate crimes.
The UN mission did, however, report a rising trend in "mafia style" crimes such as bombings and contract killings.
"We will fight organised crime, but we cannot fight these crimes if we do not have witnesses, and witnesses need protection.
So we will work on protecting witnesses", Caddy told lawmakers.

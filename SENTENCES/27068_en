ATHENS, Greece -- An appeals court cleared on Thursday (December 3rd) three suspected members of the terrorist group Revolutionary People's Struggle, known as ELA, citing insufficient evidence.
The court overturned the 2004 convictions of Christos Tsigaridas, Irene Athanasaki, and Angeletos Kanas, all of whom received 25-year sentences for membership in a terrorist organisation.
A fourth defendant -- Costas Agipiou -- died of cancer during the 13-month appeal.
The four were arrested ahead of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
The far-left ELA had been blamed for two murders and several attempted murders and bombings between 1975 and 1995, including numerous attacks against US targets.

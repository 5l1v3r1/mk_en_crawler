ZAGREB, Croatia -- Twelve candidates will compete in the December 27th presidential elections, the State Electoral Commission announced on Wednesday (November 18th).
Five of them are backed by parties and seven are running as independents.
"We received 21 candidacies, of which 12 are valid," Commission President Branko Hrvatin said.
Campaigning formally begins Thursday and will end on December 25th.
Should no candidate win more than 50% of the votes, there will be a run-off on January 10th.
Incumbent President Stipe Mesic is wrapping up his second term and cannot seek re-election.

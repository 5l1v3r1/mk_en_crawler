SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Almost 6,000 demobilised soldiers in BiH will get assistance from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to find new civilian jobs, according to IOM spokesman Haris Kaljanac.
Thousands of former BiH army members have applied for aid under one such programme.
IOM has already helped about 900 ex-soldiers.
The organisation is in the process of assisting nearly 2,300 others who need to transition to civilian life and find work.
A total of 12,000 soldiers left the military last year after staff downsizing.

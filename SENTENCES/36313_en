SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR plans to reduce troop strength next month by 500, bringing the level to 7,000, according to SFOR spokesman Captain Robert Lapreze. 
On Tuesday (25 May), he said the reduction is a result of two factors -- the increased role of local authorities in providing a "secure and safe environment" and NATO's ability "to reinforce SFOR if required".
Also Tuesday, a spokesman for the Office of the High Representative said Republika Srpska (RS) must demonstrate a dramatic change in its attitude towards the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. 
Vedran Persic said that unless RS "delivers results instead of excuses" it is putting BiH's future in Europe at risk.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The international NGO International Crisis Group (ICG) has urged both Ankara and the EU to break out of the "downward spiral" in negotiations on Turkey's EU accession, Turkish media reported.
In its annual report Monday (December 15th), the ICG warns the current deadlock could jeopardise the whole negotiating process.
The report says technical talks on Turkey's accession are going slowly and could reach a dead-end in autumn 2009, when there will be no new negotiating chapters left to open.
In other news, Turkish officials announced on Sunday they will introduce new "smart" IDs in 2010.
The smart cards apply high security measures against the risks of copy and fraud.
Personal information is hidden in the chip of the identity card with private codes.

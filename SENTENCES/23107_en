ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested 505 people during a May Day rally in Istanbul on Thursday (May 1st) marred by clashes between security forces and protesters.
Eight people were slightly injured.
The rally took place despite a ban on holding it in Istanbul's main square, Taksim.
Trade unions decided against marching to the square in light of the strong police presence.
A group of demonstrators who had tried to reach Taksim earlier in the day found the way blocked by water cannons and tear gas.
In other news, the chairman of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), Nurettin Demirtas, resigned from his post Thursday.
Police arrested him in November for allegedly presenting a phony disability report to avoid mandatory military service.
Two days ago, the court released him only so he could begin his military training.
DTP leaders now plan to elect a temporary chairman.
One possible candidate is Demirtas' brother, Selahattin.

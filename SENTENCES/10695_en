BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Local media reported on Tuesday (7 September) that Serbian police have launched an investigation against former senior Yugoslav official Goran Milinovic.
As chief of staff to the Serbian prime minister, he is suspected of destroying 160 documents generated by the joint command of the Serbian police and the Yugoslav Army in Kosovo in 1998.
In other news, the suspected mastermind of the murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic told a court in Belgrade on Tuesday that he and the late Serbian prime minister were on good terms and he had no reason to seek his removal.
Milorad "Legija" Lukovic insisted that Djindjic had never meant to extradite him or any member of his special police unit to The Hague.

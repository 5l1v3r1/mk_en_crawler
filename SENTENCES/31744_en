SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN war crimes tribunal president Claude Jorda and chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will travel to Sarajevo next week to negotiate the transfer of cases to BiH courts.
The Hague tribunal is trying to wrap up its proceedings by 2010 and has been allowing the courts to handle some of the less important cases.
Meanwhile, a Serbian official told the media that former President Milan Milutinovic could be extradited to The Hague within several days, as Belgrade comes close to reaching an agreement with the tribunal over the terms of his surrender.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Serbia must pay 3,000 euros to each of 30 police officers from Kosovo, local media reported on Thursday (November 11th). 
Belgrade was found to have violated a government decision under which employees serving in Kosovo are entitled to double salaries. 
Furthermore, Serbia must pay court costs and interest that has accrued on the back pay. 
The police officers had sought 10,000 euros each.

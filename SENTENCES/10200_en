BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu has signed a new law on general elections, according to a statement from his office Saturday (25 September). 
The law, passed by parliament and confirmed by the Constitutional Court earlier this month, aroused strong criticism from the opposition because of a provision that would enable the president to run on the ruling Social Democratic Party's lists in the 28 November parliamentary elections. 
According to the opposition, the president should remain non-partisan while in office.

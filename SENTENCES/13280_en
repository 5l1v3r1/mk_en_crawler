VIENNA, Austria -- The Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, Erhard Busek, said on Friday (26 August) that the resolution of problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo is essential to the EU integration process in the Balkans.
He boiled it down to two issues, saying BiH must become a self-sustainable state and Kosovo's final status must be resolved.
Regarding Serbia-Montenegro's future, Busek said it should be the citizens who determine the federal union's fate -- Montenegro hopes to hold a referendum on independence next year.

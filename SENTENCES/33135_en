LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg -- EU security chief Javier Solana praised the Greek presidency of the EU at a press conference Monday (16 June).
He stressed that Greece has managed to handle several problems "from the war in Iraq to the enlargement of the EU".
He singled out Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and Prime Minister Costas Simitis for special credit.
Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou meanwhile said on Tuesday that he believes the major achievement of Greece's EU presidency was creation of the EU rapid reaction force and its deployment in Macedonia.

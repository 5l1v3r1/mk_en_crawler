BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Official results based on 85 per cent of the votes confirmed there will be a second round in the Serbian presidential elections. 
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica won 31 per cent of the votes Sunday (29 September), while Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus received 27 per cent. 
Nearly 23 per cent went to ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj. 
Turnout was just 56 per cent. 
Final results are expected Tuesday.
In other news, Belgrade's Supreme Military Court has indicted former Deputy Serbian Prime Minister Momcilo Perisic for espionage. 
He was arrested in March, along with two other Serbian officials and a US diplomat. 
The diplomat was later released but the two other officials were charged with revealing state secrets. 
Perisic, who could face up to 15 years in prison, was charged with passing military documents to the United States.

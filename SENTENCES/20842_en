SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR Major General Ignacio Martin Villalain and the chief of the BiH Armed Forces Joint Staff, Lieutenant General Sifet Podzic, signed a letter of understanding Thursday (March 6th) formally transferring responsibility for weapons storage sites from EUFOR to the BiH army.
Podzic told reporters the transfer is proof of the army's growing maturity and said a Partnership for Peace member country should be responsible for the management and administration of its defence structures.
For his part, Villalain praised the progress of defence reforms in BiH.

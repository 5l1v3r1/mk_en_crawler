ANKARA, Turkey -- A top Turkish Army general, Yasar Buyukanit, has dismissed allegations that the military might have ordered the bombing of a bookstore earlier this month that led to unrest in the country's troubled southeast.
In an interview in Wednesday's (23 November) edition of the Hurriyet, Buyukanit insisted the army has always acted in accordance to the law.
Also Wednesday, parliament decided to establish a 12-member commission to investigate the incident, which took place in the Hakkari province town of Semdinli.
Separately, Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu ordered that Erdogan Gurbuz be removed as governor of Hakkari.
Ayhan Nasuhbeyoglu was given the post instead, in a bid to ease tensions there.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU and several human rights organisations expressed concern Wednesday (June 25th) over alleged violations of human rights and cases of torture in Turkey. 
Government reforms have had a positive impact, but reports of torture and inhumane treatment persist, said Ulrike Hauer, undersecretary of the EU delegation of the European Commission in Ankara. 
Human rights organisations say the number of torture complaints in Turkey climbed from 222 in 2006 to 310 in 2007.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu said Thursday (26 June) that the country would have a professional army by 2007.
It would consist of 90,000 soldiers and will be established in line with NATO standards.
He said Romanian defence experts believe mandatory military service would no longer be required, as the new concept envisions the transformation from a recruitment-based army into an army of skilled and well-trained professionals.
The concept also envisions expanded security duties for the interior ministry and the intelligence services.

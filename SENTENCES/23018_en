PRISTINA, Kosovo -- In a report titled "Four Years Later" published on Thursday (July 3rd), the OSCE criticised Kosovo's judiciary for its handling of cases stemming from the March 2004 riots. 
The report noted continued difficulties in securing witness statements, widespread failure to sentence alleged perpetrators and long delays in proceedings. 
According to the report, courts in many cases did not account for an ethnic motive as an aggravating factor. 
Tim Guldimann, head of the OSCE Mission noted "Deeds cannot be undone, but proper legal action must follow." Nineteen people were killed and over 900 injured in the riots sparked throughout Kosovo by two ethnically-motivated incidents.
In other news Thursday, President Fatmir Sejdiu signed a decree to establish a Kosovo embassy in Turkey. 
Embassies have been decreed in nine other countries, but it is not clear when exactly they will open.

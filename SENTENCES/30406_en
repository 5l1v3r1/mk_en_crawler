BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) leader Tomislav Nikolic said on Thursday (March 17th) that a possible change of government in his country would not damage Serbia's EU integration bid. 
Nikolic was speaking to reporters after meeting with EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele in Brussels. 
Nikolic said that the SNS will resume its calls for early elections after the European Commission delivers its opinion on Serbia's request for EU candidate status in October.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu will not appoint a technocrat as a prime minister after the general elections Sunday (November 30th), according to media reports Tuesday. 
"Only a politician should have the responsibility to lead the country in times of global economic crisis," Basescu told a press conference. 
He said he plans to appoint a politician who would implement Romania's national development plan for 2007-2013, which the European Commission (EC) approved. 
Basescu underscored the need for a strong, effective government with a clear economic programme, given the global financial crisis. 
The priorities should be introducing the single European currency in 2014 and lifting the EC's monitoring of Romania's justice system, Basescu said.

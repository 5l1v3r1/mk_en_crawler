BUCHAREST, Romania -- More than 5,000 people joined a rally in Bucharest on Tuesday (September 28th), the third demonstration in a week against the government's cost-cutting measures. 
The banner-waving protestors gathered outside the government building and headed to the ministries of labour and economy. 
They demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Emil Boc and his team for deciding to cut public sector salaries by 25%, as of July 1st. 
Later in the day, union representatives met with Boc to discuss the situation. 
The two sides agreed to meet again next week.

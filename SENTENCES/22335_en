ATHENS, Greece -- Two prosecutors investigating an improper real estate deal between the state and the Monastery of Vatopedi have resigned, media reported on Wednesday (October 15th).
Prosecutors Ilias Koliousis and Eleni Sotiropoulou said they uncovered evidence connecting the case to two deputy ministers.
However, their superior allegedly blocked their attempt to refer the investigation to parliament, the only body that has the right to strip ministers of their immunity.
The government rejected their resignations and ordered them to pursue the investigation.
Last month, Merchant Marine Minister George Voulgarakis resigned over his alleged involvement in the real estate deal.

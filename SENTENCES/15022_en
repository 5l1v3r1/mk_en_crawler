PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi resigned on Wednesday (1 March) after less than a year on the job, in what he described as a bid to preserve the ruling coalition's majority. 
It was reported, however, that he had been ousted by his own Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) party, which was unhappy with the government's performance. 
The AAK has nominated Agim Ceku, 45, the chief of the Kosovo Protection Force and a former KLA commander, to succeed Kosumi.
Meanwhile, the Democratic League of Kosovo (DLK) has decided to replace Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci. 
DLK Vice President Kole Berisha has been nominated to succeed him.

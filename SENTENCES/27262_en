PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier and Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi agreed on Monday (August 31st) that a solution should be found to enable Albanians to return to their properties.
Zannier expressed concern over the situation, saying that from the UN perspective, displaced people have a fundamental right to return to their homes.
"Therefore, we need to talk to all relevant stakeholders in order to make sure that security of returnees is not endangered," Zannier said.
On Monday, residents of an Albanian neighbourhood in the northern part of divided Mitrovica were barred by EULEX police from entering their properties or continuing reconstruction of their homes.
Local Serbs are staging daily protests against the return of Albanians.

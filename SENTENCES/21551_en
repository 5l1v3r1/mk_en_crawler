SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH's newest party is eager to build a multiethnic society, its leaders said to AFP on Saturday (March 24th). 
"We have to remove manipulators from the political scene, focus on citizens' lives and accelerate integration into the European Union," said Bojan Bajic, the leader of Our Party, which was established last month. 
He expressed confidence BiH could move beyond nationalism and ethnic prejudices. 
Bajic has so far managed to attract 3,000 members from all religions and all parts of BiH.
Danis Tanovic, BiH's Oscar-winning director and one of the party's cofounders, explained he returned to BiH after 10 years abroad because he believes change is possible. 
"I cannot accept that children are in separate kindergartens depending on the religious affiliation of their parents ... 
that they wait for five months to have their tonsils removed," Tanovic said.
The party hopes that its proposal of a new united alternative for BiH will attract 50% of the voters who boycotted previous polls. 
However, many analysts doubt Our Party can cross the entry threshold. 
Its first challenge will be the local elections in BiH on October 5th.

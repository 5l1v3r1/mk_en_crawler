SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Defence Council approved on Wednesday (8 January) a national position on defence and military issues for the first round of talks on Bulgaria's accession to NATO. 
The talks will be held Friday at NATO headquarters in Brussels, with round two a month later. 
Officials say the Council decided that a strategic defence review needs to be completed before the end of negotiations and that its conclusions should serve as the basis for evaluating the structure of the country's armed forces.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police in Banja Luka announced on Thursday (September 9th) the arrests of two war crimes suspects. 
Ljubisa Vranjes, 42, and Mladen Milic, 45, were detained in connection with crimes committed against civilians in the Kotor-Varos municipality during the 1992-1995 conflict.
In other news, BiH's Missing Persons Institute announced on Wednesday that the remains of about 250 people -- likely Muslims who disappeared during the conflict -- have been recovered from the Perucac Lake, in eastern BiH. 
Experts are still looking for 824 people reported missing in the Visegrad region, where Muslims are believed to have been killed by Serb forces early on. 
The Perucac, a reservoir on the Drina River, marks the border between Serbia and BiH.

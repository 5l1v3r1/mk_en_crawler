DUBROVNIK, Croatia -- State and government leaders, along with representatives of the international community, gathered in Dubrovnik Friday (July 6th) for a two-day regional summit. 
Speaking at the event, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer cited Euro-Atlantic integration and a fast resolution to the Kosovo status issue as the major factors for stability. 
"Only Euro-Atlantic integration offers the framework to make the enormous achievements of this region truly irreversible," he said, calling on countries that aspire to NATO membership to fulfil the needed reforms.
De Hoop Scheffer also warned against further delays in the Kosovo status settlement process. 
He said a UN Security Council decision based on former envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status plan would enhance stability.
Addressing summit participants Saturday, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Serbia should be included in the next waves of EU and NATO enlargement. 
He also said it was in Europe's interest for the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia â to receive a NATO membership invitation next year.

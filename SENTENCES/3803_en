Kosovo's negotiating team will attend the next session of talks led by the EU-US-Russia troika, a leading member of the group said on Sunday (August 19th).
"The Unity Group's presence at the August 30th meeting has been confirmed but there is not yet an official invitation," Hashim Thaci told Radio Free Europe.
"The aim of this meeting is to reiterate our stance," he added.
Independence is non-negotiable, and dividing Kosovo is out of the question, Thaci said.
Former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence remains the best option on the table, he said.
Amid mounting frustration in Kosovo over the delay in resolving the province's status, the province's ethnic Albanian leadership has been calling for calm.
"The current political situation and the objective we aim to reach calls for self-discipline," Prime Minister Agim Ceku said last week.
He insisted that independence will be the end result, and said the forthcoming period should be used to get ready.
"We must channel this fatigue and frustration into constructive work," he said.
Similar remarks came from Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, who vowed that the Kosovo Albanian side will not accept any option other than sovereignty.
"From the beginning of the process, we made clear that independence is non-negotiable," he said.
"However, we call on citizens to be calm and to wait through the next 120 days."
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo said conditions were peaceful, and that the mission is determined to guarantee security for everyone.
"KFOR is prepared for everything that might happen," Colonel Michael Knop said.
He said there are no signs suggesting an increase in violence.
KFOR is conducting checks on a daily basis and is working together with the Kosovo Police Service (KPS), UNMIK and multinational task forces, he added.

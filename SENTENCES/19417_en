SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The State Investigation and Protection Agency arrested three Bosnian Serbs suspected of war crimes in 1992.
Mirko "Spiro" Pekez, Ljupko Savic and Mirko "Mile" Pekez were apprehended on Tuesday (October 30th) in the Jajce region, in central BiH.
The three are suspected of involvement in the killing of 23 Bosnian Muslims and injuring four others there in September 1992.
Also Tuesday, the Serbian Security Intelligence Agency spent hours questioning Darko Mladic, son of fugitive Ratko Mladic.
His arrest is a last condition Serbia must meet for the UN war crimes tribunal to confirm full co-operation, clearing the way for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

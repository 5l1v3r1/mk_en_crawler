BUCHAREST, Romania -- All files from the Communist-era security service Securitate must be submitted by the current intelligence structures to the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives by the end of the year, under an agreement reached by President Traian Basescu and the heads of the three agencies on Tuesday (October 10th).
Basescu insists that Romania fully resolve issues related to the archives before it joins the EU in January.
In other news Tuesday, the senior government partner National Liberal Party expelled former leader Theodor Stolojan from the party.
He had announced plans to launch an effort to reform the party.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament on Friday (20 February) approved a controversial bill on administrative division of the country. 
Critics say the measure, which envisions reducing the number of municipalities from 123 to 71, would result in ethnic federalisation. 
The NGO World Macedonian Congress says it will launch a petition drive Monday to collect the 150,000 signatures necessary to hold of national referendum on the measure. 
Several municipalities have rejected the law in separate referendums over the past few months.
In other news, Slovenian Defence Minister Anton Grizold arrives Monday on a two-day visit to Macedonia to discuss bilateral co-operation, as well as Slovenia's experience in preparing for NATO membership.

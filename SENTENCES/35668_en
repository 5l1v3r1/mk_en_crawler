TETOVO, Macedonia -- Foreign experts attending a forum in Tetovo on Tuesday (6 April) said Macedonia and Croatia would probably be ready to join the EU between 2010 and 2012, followed by the other countries of the Western Balkans, which would likely join between 2012 and 2014.
Speakers outlined three critical conditions that must be met to speed up accession:
intensifying the fight against organised crime, guaranteeing efficient and independent judiciaries and preserving established borders.
In other news, a team of Macedonian and Albanian environmentalists will inspect the waters of Lake Ohrid.
There are concerns that chromium may be leaking from a mine on the Albanian side.

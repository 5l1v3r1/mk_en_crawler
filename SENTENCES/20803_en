PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The ruling parties and the opposition in Montenegro concluded negotiations Friday (October 5th) on the country's new constitution.
The opposition is expected to announce its final position shortly.
In part, the parties agreed that the official language will be Montenegrin, while Serbian, Bosniak, Albanian and Croatian will be acceptable in official use.
The constitution will also specify that anyone with dual citizenship as of June 3rd 2006 -- the day Montenegro declared independence from its union with Serbia -- will retain their citizenship.

TIRANA, Albania -- Central Election Commission (CEC) chairman Ilirjan Celibashi rejected on Tuesday (15 March) the possibility of resigning under pressure from the opposition. 
Sali Berisha, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, has called on Celibashi to step down, accusing him of serving the interests of the ruling Socialist Party. 
DP criticised the CEC chairman for the recent decision to provide data from the national register of voters to the ministry of local power and decentralisation. 
Celibashi says electronic copies containing the information went also to political parties interested in running in the next parliamentary elections.

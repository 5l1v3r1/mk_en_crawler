SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Authorities moved one step closer towards the establishment of a single economy in the country on Thursday (7 November), signing an inter-entity agreement on a single oil derivatives market. 
The document, signed by representatives of the two BiH entities as well as the Brcko District Administration, envisions the harmonisation of tariffs on oil derivatives throughout the entire territory. 
The international community's Office of the High Representative pressed for the deal after recent turmoil over oil prices and taxes threatened relations with the IMF. 
The agreement takes effect immediately.

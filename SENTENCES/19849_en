ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament failed to elect the country's next president in its first round of voting on Monday (August 20th).
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), collected 341 votes in the 550-seat chamber, just 26 short of the two-thirds majority he needed.
The other two candidates, Sabahattin Cakmakoglu from the Nationalist Action Party and Tayfun Icli from the Democratic Left Party, won 70 and 13 votes respectively.
The Republican People's Party, which controls the largest opposition faction in the legislature boycotted the vote.
A second round will be held Friday.
Analysts say Gul's best chance of winning is in the third round, when only a simple majority will be required.
Speaking after Monday's vote, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the military to stay out of politics.
"If we believe in democracy, we should not involve the Turkish military in politics.
For us they are sacred, but they have their place, and the politics has another place," Erdogan stated.
He also vowed that, once elected president, Gul will "cut all connections with our party.
From this moment on, he will be president of the Turkish republic".

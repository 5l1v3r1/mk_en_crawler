BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In an interview published Sunday (20 November), Serbian President Boris Tadic said Belgrade must finally resolve the issue of fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic.
"Either Mladic is not in Serbia, or he should turn himself in or be arrested.
Something must be done.
There is no more reason why the citizens of Serbia, Republika Srpska (RS) and BiH should suffer because of that issue," Tadic told the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine.
On Friday, meanwhile, the Serbia-Montenegro Defense Ministry issued a statement denying reports that members of the military were sheltering Mladic.
The move came after RS officials accused the Serbia-Montenegro military, as well as elements of the entity's own army, of protecting the fugitive.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro's Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic -- who also chairs the national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal -- said Friday that The Hague-based court has decided to grant a provisional release to former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff General Nebojsa Pavkovic.
The defendant will be allowed to wait in Serbia until the start of his trial.
Pavkovic surrendered to the tribunal in April.
He faces charges in connection with war crimes committed in Kosovo during the 1999 conflict.

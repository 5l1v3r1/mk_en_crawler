PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegro expects to become an official member of OSCE Wednesday (21 June), following last week's decision by the international organisation's Permanent Council on the country's accession. 
The Balkan country, which gained its independence via a referendum on 21 May, will be the organisation's 56th member. 
According to a government statement, the country is also due to be admitted as a member of the UN by 28 June.
On Tuesday, the Montenegrin cabinet decided to establish a national defence ministry, since the previous federal union one no longer exists. 
The ruling authorises Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic to act as a defence minister until parliamentary elections are held this autumn and a new government is formed.

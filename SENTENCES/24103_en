ANKARA, Turkey -- Investigators have found a skull, burnt clothes and bones during excavations in southeast Turkey, media reported on Friday (March 13th). 
The investigation is aimed at determining the fate of Kurds who went missing during clashes with Turkish security forces in the 1990s. 
An estimated 40,000 people have died since the beginning of the conflict between the Kurdistan Workers' Party and the Turkish Army in 1984, when the group began battling authorities in southeast Turkey.

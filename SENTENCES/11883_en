ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader asked EU member states Thursday (16 June) not to slow the enlargement process because of the recent rejection of the proposed EU Constitution by French and Dutch voters.
During the traditional meeting of the European Peoples' Party preceding the EU summit, Sanader said that while it is understandable for the EU to focus on more pressing problems, the enlargement process could continue in parallel.

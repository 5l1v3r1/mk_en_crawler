SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Deputy Security Minister Mijo Kresic announced on Sunday (April 29th) that his ministry is prepared to draft a new law aimed at combating extremism.
The bill would envision, among other things, a ban on all organisations that promote extremist or radical ideas.
He also said that following the adoption of a state strategy for fighting terrorism, the government is working on action plans to implement the strategy.
BiH authorities already have banned several humanitarian organisations that appear on a UN list of suspected terrorism financiers.

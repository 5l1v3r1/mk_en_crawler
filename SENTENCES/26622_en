PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Lawmakers will not discuss the EULEX-Belgrade protocol on police co-operation, Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said on Tuesday (September 8th), adding that no request for a debate has been submitted.
Pristina insists Kosovo should have been consulted about the agreement and should sign it as well.
Separately Tuesday, British Ambassador to Kosovo Andy Sparkes denied that the protocol would violate Kosovo's sovereignty.
"This protocol would help EULEX's work to prevent organised crime and any other crime, especially in the north," Sparkes said.

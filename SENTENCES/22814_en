TIRANA, Albania -- After receiving invitations to join NATO last month, Albania and Croatia are working together to agree on moves that will help them advance to full membership. 
On a visit to Tirana Monday (May 5th), Croatian Parliamentary Speaker Luka Bebic proposed to his Albanian counterpart Jozefina Topalli that they send a letter to the parliaments of NATO's 26 member countries regarding Albania's and Croatia's accession aspirations. 
"This will help us move faster towards ratification of the agreement and to receive full membership," Topalli said. 
Bebic said that they could improve relations between the two countries and "speed-up the ratification of the agreement".

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government secured conditional support for the new constitution, following a meeting with the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) on Thursday (September 23rd). 
According to statements by Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek and BDP co-chairman Selahattin Demirtas, the government and the BDP agreed on the need to start work on a new constitution immediately, while continuing dialogue within the process. 
At the same time, Cicek pointed out that BDP's conditional support should be considered only a first step in talks with the party. 
Both sides agreed that public support for a new constitution became evident after 58% voted in favour of reforms in a referendum on September 12th. 
Cicek conceded that the current constitution puts constraints on demands tabled by the BDP with regard to basic rights. 
The next step would be seeking common ground, both in terms of a new constitution and ways to end violence in southeast Turkey, where clashes between the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party and security forces continue to claim lives.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Trying to stave off political crisis, Central Bank Governor Mladjan Dinkic is urging that the candidate with fewer votes in Sunday's (13 October) run-off presidential election immediately back the winner if turnout dips below the required 50 per cent. 
Dinkic stressed Tuesday that if no president is elected, Serbia would plunge into deep political crisis, which should be avoided at all costs. 
In the first round, Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica narrowly defeated Deputy Prime Miroljub Labus. 
Dinkic is one of Labus' strongest supporters.

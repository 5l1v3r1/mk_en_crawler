SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government submitted answers Tuesday (10 May) to 189 more questions from the European Commission regarding Macedonia's application for official EU candidate status.
Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska said the additional information refers mostly to economic criteria and 29 chapters of European legislation.
The next round of negotiations between the government and the EC takes place in Brussels on 31 May.
Also Tuesday, the government decided to issue bail guarantees for two Macedonian war crimes indictees -- former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and former security official Johan Tarculovski -- until their trial before the UN war crimes tribunal begins.
The formal letter offering state guarantees will be sent to The Hague within days.

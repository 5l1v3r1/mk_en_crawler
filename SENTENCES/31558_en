BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A Belgrade court issued another arrest warrant for Slobodan Milosevic's wife after she failed twice to appear for trial in a case of alleged abuse of power, court officials said Friday (18 April). 
The district court also ordered an unspecified period of detention for Mirjana Markovic, sought by police for questioning in connection with the 2000 slaying of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic. 
Court officials said Markovic was charged with inciting state officials to abuse their position, and that she did not show up Thursday for the start of the trial. 
It was the second time Markovic disobeyed the order, the court said. 
She is believed to be in Russia, where she fled in February.

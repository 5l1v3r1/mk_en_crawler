SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government decided on Thursday (April 16th) to allocate nearly 5m euros to address the waste crisis and its environmental impact in Sofia, media reported. 
The funds will pay for workers to remove rubbish and to wash down streets, sidewalks, and bus stops. 
Last week, the cabinet officially declared an emergency situation in Sofia. 
The streets have lain under rubbish for several weeks since the city council cancelled an agreement with the trash hauler.

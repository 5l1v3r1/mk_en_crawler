ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted Wednesday (October 17th) to allow the government to conduct military operations against terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases in Iraq. 
Before the vote, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told lawmakers that the decision would not trigger an immediate incursion. 
Though Turkey has 60,000 troops near the Iraqi border, few experts believe it will launch a full-scale invasion. 
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki phoned Erdogan on Wednesday, assuring him that Baghdad is serious about dealing with the PKK threat to Turkey. 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh, a Kurd, warned that any incursion would inflict irreparable damage on bilateral relations, and would destabilise the entire region.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer phoned Turkish President Abdullah Gul and urged restraint after Wednesday's vote in parliament. 
US President George W. 
Bush sent a similar message. 
But Syrian President Bashar Assad, who arrived in Ankara on Wednesday, said Turkey has a legitimate right to stage a cross-border offensive.

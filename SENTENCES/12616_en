TIRANA, Albania -- The leaders of both major parties -- Fatos Nano of the ruling Socialist Party (SP) and Sali Berisha of the opposition Democratic Party (DP) -- are claiming victory in Sunday's (3 July) parliamentary elections. 
Addressing a crowd of supporters in Tirana, Berisha said the DP had won a "profound" victory, triumphing in the majority of the country's 100 constituencies. 
At the same time, incumbent Prime Minister Nano said the Socialists won about 71 of the 100 seats in the 140-member parliament that will be assigned via direct ballots. 
Exit polls suggest the DP ended up with about 35 per cent of support, compared to 34 per cent for SP.
The Central Election Commission's is to present the first official results late Monday. 
Voter turnout was estimated at 56 per cent. 
The vote is considered a key test of the democratisation process and an indication of Albania's readiness to progress further towards EU and NATO membership.

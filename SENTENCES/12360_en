THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj surrendered to the UN tribunal on Wednesday (9 March).
A UN spokesman confirmed that the former KLA commander was in the custody of the international court but refused to provide details.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan welcomed Haradinaj's decision to resign and hand himself over, describing it as a "good example of co-operation".
The specific charges against him have not been announced.
Lahi Brahimaj and Idriz Balaj, whose names reportedly appear on the same indictment, surrendered to the tribunal with Haradinaj.
The situation in Kosovo remained calm following the indictments.
A group of students held a silent vigil in Pristina but there were no reports of violence or unrest.
In other news, former Yugoslav Army Chief of General Staff Momcilo Perisic appeared before the UN tribunal on Wednesday to plead not guilty to charges of murder, persecution and attacks on civilians in Sarajevo, Srebrenica and Zagreb between 1993 and 1995.
He surrendered to The Hague on Monday.

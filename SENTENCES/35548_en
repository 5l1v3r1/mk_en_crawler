ANKARA, Turkey -- The Court of Appeals freed four jailed Kurdish politicians, including leading human rights activist Leyla Zana, on Wednesday (9 June).
The move coincided with the start of Kurdish language broadcasts on state-run radio and television.
Zana, winner of the European Parliament's 1995 Sakharov Prize, and her co-defendants are former MPs.
They were convicted over their membership in the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party and served ten years in prison.
The European Court of Human Rights had condemned the sentences, arguing that the politicians had not received a fair trial.
The EU welcomed their release.
"Today's decision is a sign that the implementation of political reforms, which Turkey has been introducing in the past two years, is gaining ground," said Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen.

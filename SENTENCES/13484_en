BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Turkey to focus on meeting set reforms that would eventually bring the country into the EU, in a speech to members of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee in Brussels Wednesday (23 November). 
Rehn said the time for celebrations is over and the country must now implement promised measures, including those related to Cyprus.

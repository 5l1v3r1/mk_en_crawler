SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski said Saturday (14 May) that the UN envoy in the ongoing name dispute with Greece, Matthew Nimitz, will visit Skopje this week. 
According to Crvenkovski, the talks will focus on agreeing on a timetable for UN-mediated negotiations in the coming months.
Separately, Nikola Gruevski, leader of the main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, called for a referendum on the country's constitutional name by the end of this year. 
Gruevski believes that a referendum would reaffirm the public's desire to keep the name "Republic of Macedonia".
In other news, Macedonian Justice Minister Meri Mladenovska-Gjorgievska said Friday that the ministry has started work on adjusting the country's election legislation. 
Amendments would seek to harmonise the laws in line with international standards and ensure fair and democratic voting.

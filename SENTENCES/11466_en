BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Nine people, including three Bulgarians, were killed Thursday (21 April) when a commercial helicopter went down north of Baghdad, according to US military sources, who suspect it was shot down.
The helicopter was flying between the Iraqi capital and the northern city of Tikrit when it crashed.
The Russian-made MI-8 carried a crew of three -- thought to be Bulgarians -- and six passengers, the sources said.

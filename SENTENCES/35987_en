ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic said Wednesday (31 December) that the good showing by nationalists in Serbia's parliamentary elections would boost his country's bid for EU membership, as it highlights its status as the region's democratic leader. 
"I believe that Croatia will gain even more credibility and accelerate its approach to the EU," he said. 
He added that Croatia would serve as encouragement to other Balkan nations as it makes progress towards EU membership. 
Croatia applied for EU membership in February and is hoping to receive official candidate status this year.

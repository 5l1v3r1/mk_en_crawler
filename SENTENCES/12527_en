THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The former Yugoslav Army chief of staff surrendered to the UN tribunal on Monday (7 March) to stand trial for atrocities committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo between 1993 and 1998. 
General Momcilo Perisic has been indicted on 13 counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war. 
Prosecutors contend that he was aware of plans by Bosnian Serb commanders to engage in a campaign of "persecution, forcible transfer and killings" of Muslims in Srebrenica, but failed to stop them. 
Perisic will also be held accountable for attacks on civilians in Zagreb and Sarajevo. 
A preliminary hearing is expected later in the week. 
In Belgrade, Serbian State Administration Minister Zoran Loncar said he expects all Hague indictees currently on Serbian territory to surrender to the UN tribunal.
Also Monday, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte told Reuters that Serbian authorities know the exact whereabouts of Ratko Mladic and can arrest him "in hours". 
She said Mladic still enjoys the protection of former senior military officers, but added that support for him has waned since the 2003 murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

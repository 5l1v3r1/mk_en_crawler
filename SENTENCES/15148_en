STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament's (EP) vote on future Bulgarian and Romanian Commissioners will take place on 4 January, an EP panel decided on Thursday (28 September). 
Each country will submit at least three nominees to European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso, who will then choose one from each. 
After they are endorsed, the new commissioners will serve until October 2008, when the term of the current commission expires.

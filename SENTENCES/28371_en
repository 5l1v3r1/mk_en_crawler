TIRANA, Albania -- Police announced on Sunday (August 15th) the surrender of a young man accused of a deadly hit and run traffic accident late Thursday that sparked interethnic tensions.
Witnesses say Ilir Muka, a 20 year old from Vlora, deliberately ran over Aristid Guma, 35, a member of the Greek minority in Himara, who was heading home on his motorbike after arguing with Muka and a carload of other young men, several of whom were later arrested.
After the incident, about 100 members of the Greek minority blocked the national road for 14 hours Friday, causing havoc and miles of queues for tourists.
Muka's family says the incident was a car accident and that the issue should not be politicised.
However, representatives of the Greek minority and the Orthodox Church say it could affect ties between the Albanian majority and the Greek minority.
Greece's main opposition New Democracy party sent a letter to European Commission in Brussels asking the Albanian government to clarify the situation, saying that "when minorities' rights are violated, they affect the European perspective of Albania." (BBC, Lajmifundit, Shekulli - 16/08/10;

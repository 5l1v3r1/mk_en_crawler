BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Tuesday (11 November) that there would be 13 more indictments against citizens of Serbia-Montenegro.
She said that once all have been issued, local courts would be allowed to take over some of the cases.
She added, however, that Belgrade's co-operation has deteriorated since the recent indictments of four police and army generals.
In other news, a new poll suggests low voter turnout may once again doom Sunday's presidential election in Serbia.
Twice last year, elections were invalidated because fewer than 50 per cent of voters went to the polls.
Also Tuesday, representatives from the OSCE and the Council of Europe submitted to the OSCE presidency a report on Montenegro's human trafficking record.
An investigation began last year, after a young Moldavian woman accused state officials of involvement in human trafficking.

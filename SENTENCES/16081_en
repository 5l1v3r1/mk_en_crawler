BELGRADE, Serbia -- Ruzica Djindjic, the widow of assassinated Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, said on Thursday (November 16th) that she is ready to serve as the country's next premier.
She was responding to a reporter's question after the main opposition Democratic Party (DS) -- previously led by Zoran Djindjic -- implied it might nominate a woman prime minister if it wins the January 21st parliamentary elections.
She did not rule out the possibility of co-operating with the Democratic Party of Serbia and the Liberal Democratic Party, a former DS faction which formed a coalition with other small parties to surpass the 5% election threshold.

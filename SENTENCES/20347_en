ATHENS, Greece -- Phoned-in bomb threats prompted officials to evacuate an underground subway station in Athens Monday night (October 15th) and the ministry of employment Monday morning.
Nothing was found at either location.
Late on Sunday, another threat prompted a plane travelling from the island of Kos to Amsterdam with 288 passengers onboard to make an emergency landing.
After a search of the plane, it flew on to The Netherlands.
Police say a Greek man who had been barred from boarding the flight is suspected of phoning in the threat.

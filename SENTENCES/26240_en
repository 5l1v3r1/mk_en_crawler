PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Officials confirmed on Wednesday (March 17th) that ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is a Montenegrin citizen and is currently in the country. 
Media reported late that week that Shinawatra was spotted in the town of Budva. 
Though he is wanted by authorities in his country, where he was sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for corruption, Montenegrin police say they have no reason to arrest him. 
Shinawatra was ousted in a 2006 military coup amid accusations of corruption and abuse of power. 
He was granted Montenegrin citizenship and a passport last year.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described the NATO summit in Istanbul as a huge success and a key step towards NATO's transformation.
After the summit ended Tuesday (29 June), he said the country had been a successful host, mingling Islamic culture with Western European democracy and mixing together traditionalism and modernism.
In other news, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul reiterated on Wednesday that the country has met all criteria for opening EU accession talks.
Turkey hopes to receive a specific date for launching negotiations in December.
Also Wednesday, a Turkish court began hearing testimony in the trial of 69 suspects charged with involvement in last year's suicide bombings in Istanbul, which have been blamed on al-Qaeda.
Thirteen suspects, including two women who allegedly played minor roles in the attacks, were taken to the court to testify.
Ten of them agreed to take the stand, while three refused.

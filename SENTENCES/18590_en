ANKARA, Turkey -- A fourth child hospitalised in Turkey with bird flu-like symptoms has tested negative for the disease, the Health Ministry announced on Sunday (February 11th).
Three other children from the southeastern Batman village of Bogazkoy were cleared on Saturday and released from hospital.
But according to media reports, more cases may be pending:
three people -- two adults and one child, were admitted to hospital in the Batman province with suspicious symptoms.
They are said to have had contact with birds.
Late last week, Turkey's government confirmed that the dangerous H5N1 strain of the virus has re-emerged.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament is to start discussing the 2010 budget bill Monday (January 11th), in hopes of a vote by week's end, as pledged to the IMF.
Thus far, parliamentary committees have largely ignored the government's draft, adding amendment after amendment.
Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu has threatened to resign if these various amendments are not dropped.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou met with his Canadian counterpart Stephen Harper in Athens on Saturday (May 28th), visiting parliament and attending a roundtable of business delegations from the two countries.
They discussed bilateral relations, economic developments -- including the situation in the Eurozone -- and Greece's efforts to deal with its financial woes.
"We have every confidence that our Greek hosts here and our European friends will continue to deal with the matters so the global economy can continue to grow," Harper said.

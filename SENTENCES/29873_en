SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Sunday (February 27th) that authorities are prepared to hold early elections despite "bluffing" on the part of the opposition SDSM.
He also accused SDSM leader Branko Crvenkovski of pressuring State Election Commission President Aleksandar Novakovski to resign.
Novakovski, who was nominated by the opposition, stepped down last week.
Gruevski reiterated that most of the demands set by the opposition to return to parliament are achievable but stressed again he cannot interfere in the A1 TV case, as the opposition insists.
The accounts of the popular TV channel were blocked in late January as part of a tax fraud investigation against ten companies registered at A1's address.
The move triggered a parliamentary boycott by some opposition parties led by SDSM, who claimed the decision was politically motivated.

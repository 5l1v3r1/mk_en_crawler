SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ivan Kostov, a former prime minister and leader of the rightist Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB), announced on Wednesday (August 22nd) that his party seeks the resignations of Minister of State Policy for Disasters and Accidents Emel Etem and Minister of Agriculture and Foods Nihat Kabi. 
The DSB blames them for soaring food prices and inadequate grain supplies. 
According to Kostov, Etem is responsible for the grain crisis, while corruption and incompetence in Kabi's ministry have led to the worst inflation since 1997.

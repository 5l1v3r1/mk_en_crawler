ATHENS, Greece -- Anti-terror police announced on Thursday (January 27th) they have arrested a young man suspected in a series of parcel bombings in November. 
The suspect, 22, was detained in Athens on Wednesday, carrying weapons and a fake ID card. 
The militant group Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire has taken responsibility for the bombs, which were sent to embassies across Europe in the end of last year.
Meanwhile, an envelope containing bullets and a letter was discovered at Greece's Embassy in Madrid on Thursday. 
The Greek Consulate in Barcelona received a similar letter Wednesday.
In other news, two small explosions hit Athens early Thursday. 
No injuries were reported, only minor material damage. 
One occurred near a municipality building in the central district of Zografou; the other was in front of a fast-food restaurant.

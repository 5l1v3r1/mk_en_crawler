BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Constitutional Court on Thursday (April 22nd) ruled out the possibility of extending the functions of the National Integrity Agency (ANI) by an emergency decree. 
The ANI is a key anti-corruption institution, responsible for monitoring the assets of senior officials and identifying conflicts of interests. 
Last week, the Constitutional Court ruled the agency has acted beyond its scope as an investigative body and has not observed the principle of "innocent until proven guilty". 
When the government announced it could restore these powers through an emergency decree, the Constitutional Court on Thursday rejected this option as incompatible with its ruling.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday voiced concern about the possibility of weakening the ANI's role. 
After talks in Brussels with Romanian President Traian Basescu, Barroso said that "the agency needs a firm legal basis to guarantee full independence and the ability to conduct proper investigations." Basescu assured him that the agency will be able to function properly.

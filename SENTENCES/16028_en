BELGRADE, Serbia -- Croatia will be the greatest supporter of Serbia's accession to the EU, Croatian president Stipe Mesic said in an interview broadcast on Belgrade's Pink TV Tuesday (October 17th). 
He said EU enlargement could not be complete until Southeast Europe is fully integrated. 
Entire countries should not be held responsible for the war crimes of individuals, Mesic said, adding that regional judiciaries must co-operate to close that chapter in history.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling coalition decided on Wednesday (December 6th) that elections for Bulgaria's European Parliament members would be held by mid-May.
The agreement was reached during a meeting of leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, NMS-II and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.
They also decided that party tickets should contain candidates for all 18 seats awarded to Bulgaria.
Later Wednesday, the former leader of the small opposition rightist Union of Democratic Forces, Nadezhda Mihailova, called on right-wing parties to unite and form a common ticket of their own.

WASHINGTON, United States -- State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said on Tuesday (13 June) that the United States recognises Montenegro as an independent and sovereign state and will consider establishing diplomatic relations with it.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has sent a letter to the government of Montenegro congratulating it on the "peaceful and democratic" referendum on independence held last month.
The statement came shortly after the EU and several countries, including Croatia and Macedonia, recognised Montenegro's independence.
Also Tuesday, the finance ministers and central bank governors of Montenegro and Serbia met in Belgrade to discuss post-referendum membership in international finance institutions.
The talks are to continue next week.

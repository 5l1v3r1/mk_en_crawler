TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission (EC) announced on Monday (March 9th) it would grant 60.9m euros to Albania as part of its pre-accession partnership. 
The funds will finance 24 projects in administrative reform, education and rural infrastructure, in order to bring Albania closer to EU membership.
EC Ambassador to Tirana Helmuth Lohan and Albanian EU Integration Minister Majlinda Bregu also signed an agreement worth 3.1m euros to help Albania rebuild a village near Gerdec, damaged in the deadly munition blast a year ago. 
The funds will finance the reconstruction of a school, water supply and sewage system. 
Opposition parties plan to commemorate victims of the tragedy Sunday.
In other news Monday, President Bamir Topi submitted his application for a new electronic ID card and called on others to follow his example. 
He noted the new identity documents would enable citizens to vote in the June parliamentary elections and would make travel to EU countries easier. 
Separately, Interior Minister Bujar Nishani rejected claims by opposition parties that the process for issuing new ID cards had failed. 
He said that all those who applied in February could expect their cards now.

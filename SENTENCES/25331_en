THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY) on Friday (February 26th) rejected a request by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to postpone his trial, ruling the proceedings will start next week after he makes his opening statements. 
Karadzic, who is conducting his own defence, has agreed to present his initial arguments early next week. 
But he has requested the rest of the trial to be delayed until June 17th, insisting he needs more time to prepare his defence. 
Marko Sladojevic, legal advisor of Karadzic, said Friday's decision would be appealed. 
The trial of the former Bosnian Serb leader began on October 27th but was suspended until March, due to his refusal to attend the sessions.

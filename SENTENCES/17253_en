NEW YORK, United States -- Russian Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin denied a report Tuesday (May 29th) that Moscow and Washington have hammered out an agreement on a new UN resolution regarding Kosovo. 
"That information is untrue. 
The current situation is as it was yesterday and the day before, nothing has changed," Churkin was quoted as saying.
On Monday, the Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List reported that Russia, the United States and the EU had reached a compromise regarding Kosovo's future status. 
The paper said Russia would not veto a UN resolution on Kosovo as long as Brussels and Washington accepted a two-year moratorium on UN membership for Kosovo, allowed Russian soldiers to help guard Serb enclaves in Kosovo, and kept NATO from offering membership to Ukraine and Georgia next year.
Meanwhile, in separate remarks Tuesday, UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker told Radio Free Europe that a decision on Kosovo is weeks, not months away. 
At the same time, he acknowledged the need for further reforms.

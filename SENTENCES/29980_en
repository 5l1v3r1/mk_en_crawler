ANKARA, Turkey -- Popular artist Bedri Baykam and his assistant were attacked and stabbed in Istanbul on Monday (April 18th) after participating in a meeting to protest the destruction of a controversial monument in the eastern city of Kars.
The monument is dedicated to Turkish-Armenian friendship.
Baycam and his assistant are in hospital in stable condition.
Their unidentified attacker surrendered to police later in the day, explaining his move was prompted by Baycam allegedly offending him.
The monument in question spurred political controversy after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Kars earlier this year and described the monument as "monstrous" and called for it to be torn down.
Demolition began last weekend.

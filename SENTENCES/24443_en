ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian government will accept European Commission (EC) mediation on the border issue with Slovenia, President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader agreed at a meeting with members of the parties in parliament on Monday (March 9th). 
However, Croatia will insist that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) arbitrate and that the EC help craft a proposal to the ICJ. 
In addition, the EC mediation group -- which Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari will lead -- could also help the two countries draft proposals aimed at resolving other issues involving navigation and fisheries in the Adriatic.
Zagreb's insistence on using EC mediation as a means to eventual ICJ arbitration does not sit well with Ljubljana. 
On Monday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said "At first glance, Croatia's position seems to decrease the possibility for mediation." (Tanjug, B92, STA, HRT, HINA - 09/03/09)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's top international envoy, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, is hinting that the Office of the High Representative's (OHR) mandate may be extended, due to delays in the Kosovo status settlement process. 
In an interview in Monday's (January 22nd) edition of Dnevni avaz, Schwarz-Schilling said plans to close OHR and transform it into an EU Special Representative's office in mid-2007 were based on an earlier timetable, in which the UN proposal for Kosovo's status was to be released in November 2006. 
The proposal is now slated for release in early February.

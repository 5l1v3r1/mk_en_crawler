BUCHAREST, Romania -- Public workers will walk off their jobs in March to protest reduced salaries, union representative Sebastian Oprescu warned on Thursday (February 25th). 
He said that a demonstration will be organised in April in Bucharest while a general strike is expected by mid-May. 
Oprescu said as many as 500,000 public servants could join the general strike if the government fails to respect collective labour agreements and continues with wage-cutting measures. 
Oprescu also voiced concern over a recent statement by the Labour Ministry that it will not implement a range of collective labour agreements this year. 
In a bid to cut spending, the government says it must trim the public workforce. 
Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu has said more than 100,000 jobs will be cut over the next four years.

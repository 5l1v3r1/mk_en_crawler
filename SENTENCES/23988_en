PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) supports President Fatmir Sejdiu's decision to hold local elections this year, saying it is legitimate, PDK spokesperson Blerand Stavileci said on Sunday (January 18th). 
EU Special Representative Pieter Feith has confirmed the decision fully complies with Kosovo's constitution.
Separately Sunday, the leader of the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj, was in Mitrovica, where he said talks on resolving technical issues with Serbia should not begin before Kosovo takes "possession" of the north. 
He said Pristina officials must present this as a condition for beginning any such talks.

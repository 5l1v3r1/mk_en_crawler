ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou on Friday (April 23rd) asked for the activation of an EU/IMF aid mechanism totalling 45 billion euros. 
In a televised address, Papandreou said that it is "a matter of national and pressing necessity" to request the aid. 
The announcement comes a day after the EU's statistical service, Eurostat, revised figures for Greece's 2009 deficit from 12.9% to 13.6%of GDP, prompting the credit rating agency Moody's to downgrade Greece's credit rating.

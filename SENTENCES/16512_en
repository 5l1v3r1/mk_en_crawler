LUXEMBOURG -- The EU foreign ministers approved an action plan Monday (10 April) to establish a possible EU police mission in Kosovo after its final status is determined. 
The document, adopted during the ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, envisions the establishment of an EU planning team, which would prepare for a smooth transition between UNMIK and the proposed EU crisis management operation. 
A 30-member EU planning team would gradually deploy in Kosovo from late April until early September. 
The mission itself is expected to begin deployment in January.
In other news Monday, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen urged Serbia to stop its boycott policy in Kosovo and encourage local Serbs to participate in provincial institutions. 
Addressing a workshop in Pristina, Jessen-Petersen voiced deep concern over the current situation, saying that while the international community works to lay the foundation for the return of Kosovo Serbs, Belgrade is working in the opposite direction.

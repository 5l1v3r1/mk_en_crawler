TESLIC, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic said Sunday (6 July) that constitutional changes would not occur in the near future.
Commenting on a recent proposal by the Bosniak member of the presidency, Sulejman Tihic, Ivanic said the government is focused on economic reforms and would not move discussion of the constitution onto the daily agenda.
Discussion at this stage could be harmful, he suggested.

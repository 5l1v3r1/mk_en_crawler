NICOSIA, Cyprus -- UN Special Envoy for Cyprus Alexander Downer has called on Cypriot leaders to build on the current momentum in ongoing reunification talks, local media reported on Saturday (January 10th). 
After a meeting Friday with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias, Downer said he opposes establishing "artificial deadlines" for completing the talks and warned such deadlines can only trigger a crisis. 
He also stressed a future solution should come from Cypriots rather than from "foreigners". 
"This is not a process that will be owned by the UN or the international community," he said.
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are meeting Monday in their 15th round of direct reunification talks since negotiations began in September.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling coalition partners may renominate Ognyan Gerdzhikov to the post of parliament speaker, according to statements the parties released Monday (14 February).
Opposition MPs removed Gerdzhikov in a joint vote earlier this month in what was widely seen as a warning to the government, rather than an attack on Gerdzhikov personally.
The coalition partners, including the newest member, New Time, were expected to discuss the issue Tuesday.

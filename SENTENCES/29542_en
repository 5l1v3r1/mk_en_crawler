SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A mixed commission of local and international experts should be established to investigate the June 2009 general election process in Albania and end the ongoing political stalemate, Party of European Socialists' President Poul Rasmussen said on Wednesday (March 31st) in Sarajevo. 
"Full transparency and a commission ... 
should end this crisis," Rasmussen told a congress of left-wing parties. 
Albania's Socialist Party (SP) recently ended a complete boycott of parliament staged for months over the government's refusal to open ballot boxes and investigate the contested elections. 
However, the party has said it will only attend parliamentary sessions related to the transparency of elections, skipping the rest.

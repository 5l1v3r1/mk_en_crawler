ATHENS, Greece -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was in Athens on Thursday (October 21st) as part of preparations for the Alliance's Lisbon summit on November 19th-20th.
He had separate meetings with Prime Minister George Papandreou, Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas and Defence Minister Evangelos Venizelos.
Afterwards, Droutsas said that NATO's new strategic concept generally meets Greece's demands "mainly as regards the collective defence and the unanimity rule in decision making".
Rasmussen thanked Greece for its dedication and co-operation, but at the same time, said he hoped hurdles posed to EU-NATO co-operation by the Cypriot issue could be removed.

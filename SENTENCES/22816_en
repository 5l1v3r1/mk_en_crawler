ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot said on Thursday (November 6th) that if Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo want to join the EU, they must overcome their most serious problems -- organised crime and corruption.
Barrot's comment came during a meeting in Zagreb of interior and justice ministers from countries in Southeast Europe and EU representatives.
He stressed that these countries should make judicial systems and the work of police more effective, promising the EU will recognise such efforts.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The police arrested 20 drug dealers on Friday (August 8th) who were part of a large-scale operation in Split in which more than 6kg of heroin were seized.
Police officers in collaboration with the Office for the Prevention of Corruption and Organised Crime have been following the group for more than a month.
Besides heroin, the police also found 10kg of a paracetamol-caffeine mixture, which is added to the drug to increase its weight.
This was the second drug dealers' group busted by the police in Split in less than a week.

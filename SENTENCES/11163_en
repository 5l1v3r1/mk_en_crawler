BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church issued a statement Friday (25 March) condemning recent incidents involving anti-Semitism and urging the government to do more to prevent such incidents in the future. 
The statement followed the appearance of hate messages against the Jewish community, pro-Western human rights groups and a liberal broadcaster.
On Saturday, a Serb Orthodox Church delegation kicked off a visit to the United States that will focus on issues related to Kosovo. 
Serb religious leaders are meeting with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York on Monday. 
They will then head to Washington for talks with top officials.

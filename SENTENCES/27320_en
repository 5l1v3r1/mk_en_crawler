ANKARA, Turkey -- The rightist Motherland Party (ANAP) and the Democratic Party (DP) decided at a congress Saturday (October 31st) to merge into a single political bloc. 
The ANAP, established in 1983 by Turgut Ozal, becomes the DP, which was originally established that same year by Suleyman Demirel under the name Dogru Yol, or True Path Party.

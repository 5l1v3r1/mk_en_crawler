SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Outgoing UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has sent a letter to Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, calling again for a positive resolution of the case involving five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor. 
The six are under a death sentence for allegedly infecting over 400 children with HIV in Libya. 
According to Libyan media reports, Annan expressed sympathy for the families of the infected children and stressed the international community's commitment to helping them. 
At the same time, he expressed the shock felt worldwide over the verdict, reiterating the UN's firm stance again the death penalty.
Separately, the Union of Arab Associations in Bulgaria issued a statement Wednesday (December 27th), explicitly rejecting the death sentences, particularly the use of torture to elicit "confessions".

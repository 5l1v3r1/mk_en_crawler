MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown worked Thursday (17 April) to shore up financing for the city of Mostar.
Under decisions issued by Ashdown, the Federation of BiH's two power utilities should allocate funds to Mostar, making monthly payments directly to the city's administration.
These revenues will make up about half the budget, which might otherwise face collapse.
In other news, World Bank resident representative to BiH Joseph Ingram said the Bank would continue providing assistance for the rebuilding of Mostar.
He visited the city Thursday with Deputy High Representative Donald Hays and the BiH presidency's Croat member, Dragan Covic.

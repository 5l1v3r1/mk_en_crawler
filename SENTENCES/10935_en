TIRANA, Albania -- The Dutch EU presidency released a statement Thursday (30 September) expressing concern over the slow pace of reforms in Albania, particularly those related to elections.
The statement was in response to a report outgoing OSCE Presence head, Ambassador Osmo Lipponen, presented to the OSCE Permanent Council on Thursday.
In the report, Lipponen criticised the political parties for the deadlock within the bipartisan electoral commission.
The Dutch presidency pointed out that the 2005 elections would be decisive for Albania's aspirations to join the EU and its progress in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Authorities on Friday (7 January) extradited Yahya Murat Demirel, the nephew of former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, to Turkey, as Ankara had requested.
Bulgarian border police detained Yahya Demirel two weeks ago, and said he had forged identity documents.
He is charged with embezzlement and damaging the Turkish state in the amount of 900m euros as a co-owner of the bankrupt Egebank.
In other news, the Bulgarian government endorsed draft amendments to the law on classified information Thursday and forwarded them to parliament for approval.
But representatives of the right-wing opposition protest the cabinet's decision, warning that the situation could lead to the illegal destruction of secret documents.

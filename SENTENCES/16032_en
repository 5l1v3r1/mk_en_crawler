SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev requested on Monday (17 July) that the High Judicial Council (HJC) lift the immunity of Sofia deputy appeals prosecutor Nikolay Ganchev, for alleged links to crime bosses. 
Velchev insisted that the HJC decide the matter at its next session, Wednesday. 
He also again called for the resignations or dismissals of two other prosecutors, Lyulin Matev and Zdravko Yordanov, following a recent internal investigation.
In other news Monday, the Sofia Municipal Election Commission rejected a request by the rightist opposition Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) to relieve Sofia Mayor Boyko Borissov of his duties. 
DSB says he continued to serve on the boards of two trading companies in violation of the law on local government law. 
The election commission says Borissov has provided documents that refute those claims.

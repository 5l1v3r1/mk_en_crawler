ATHENS, Greece -- President Karolos Papoulias says that his country, together with EU newcomers Bulgaria and Romania, create a Balkan "nucleus" that can play an important role in the Union's decision-making process. 
Such a role would be comparable to that of the Baltic States, he explained. 
Interviews with Papoulias were published in the Greek and Bulgarian press at the weekend, ahead of his visits to Sofia and Bucharest this week. 
He stressed that the three neighbouring countries could work together on various EU programmes and implement projects of mutual interest in key sectors, such as energy. 
Papoulias also reiterated Greek support for the European prospects of Turkey and Macedonia, should both meet their commitments to the EU.

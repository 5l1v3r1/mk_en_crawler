ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb Medical Faculty selected seven physicians Tuesday (19 November) to examine indicted Gen Janko Bobetko, at the request of the Zagreb county court. 
The local court began investigating after the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague indicted the retired army chief of staff for war crimes committed during the Serbian-Croatian war in 1991-1995. 
The exam will determine whether Bobetko's frail health could withstand travel to The Hague. 
An alternative might be questioning him in Zagreb.
In other news, two international lawyers at The Hague want former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic set free for one year, the Danish daily  Dagen reported Wednesday. 
The newspaper says lawyers Steven Kay of Britain and Branislav Tapuskovic of Serbia recommended in a confidential document submitted to the tribunal's judges that Milosevic be freed for a year to regain his health and prepare his defence. 
Milosevic, who is battling high blood pressure and exhaustion, refuses to accept counsel.

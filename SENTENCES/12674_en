SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister-designate Vlado Buckovski said Sunday (5 December) that the leaders of two ethnic Albanian political parties plan to visit the village of Kondovo, where paramilitary groups have reportedly been active.
Ali Ahmeti, of the Democratic Union of Integration, and Menduh Thaci, deputy leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians, say they will clarify the situation in the village, located just west of Skopje.
Buckovski says Kondovo is an isolated case that will not lead to renewed violence.
In other news, it was announced that the UNDP plans to extend approximately $33m in assistance to Macedonia over the next four years.
An official said the funds would be designated mainly for projects involving decentralisation and the development of local self-government.

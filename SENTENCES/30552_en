PRISTINA, Kosovo -- European Commission (EC) Director for the Western Balkans Pierre Mirel visited Mitrovica on Tuesday (May 10th), stressing the importance of Kosovo-Serbia discussions, which he says will help resolve concrete issues.
He also said that both the EU integration process and the visa liberalisation process should be perceived as more than one-time deals.
"This is a long term process;
it cannot be expected for the problems to be resolved at once," Mirel stressed.
Meanwhile, three members of the European Parliament (EP) -- Ulrike Lunacek, Tanja Fajon and Hannes Swoboda -- have sent a letter to Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter, whose country holds the EU rotating presidency, requesting the immediate start of the visa liberalisation process for Kosovo.
They urged him to inform the EU member states about this issue prior to Thursday's meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Pristina-based daily Express reported on Wednesday.

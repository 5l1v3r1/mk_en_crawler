BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's highest court decided on Tuesday (January 23rd) to grant provisional release to a senior US investment banker, a Bulgarian consultant, and two Romanian officials. 
The banker, Vadim Benyatov of Credit Suisse First Boston Europe's London office, faces charges of commercial espionage. 
Prosecutors say Stamen Stancev, a Bulgarian consultant working for the bank, headed a conspiracy to obtain secret documents, which were passed on to foreign firms bidding to participate in the privatisation of Romanian state-owned assets.
The two Romanians detained in the case are the former head of the state privatisation department, Dorinel Mucea, and the former adviser at the Ministry of Communications, Mihai Donciu. 
All four have been told not to leave Romania for 30 days. 
They were arrested in November.

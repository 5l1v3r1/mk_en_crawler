THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will visit the Balkans and Brussels next week, according to a statement released Wednesday (22 March).
It said she will travel to Banja Luka and Belgrade on 29 March to discuss the cases of indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
Subsequently, she will visit Brussels on 31 March to present a report to the EU on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia-Montenegro's level of co-operation.
Meanwhile, Serbian President Boris Tadic said on national TV that authorities are asking the international community to give Belgrade "a flexible deadline" for the arrest and extradition of Mladic.
The EU has warned Belgrade that unless Mladic is handed over before the next round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks, scheduled for 5 April, negotiations would be interrupted.
At The Hague on Wednesday, the only person jailed for life by the international war crimes tribunal had his sentence cut on appeal to 40 years.
Milomir Stakic, the 44-year-old former mayor of Prijedor in northern BiH, was held responsible for notorious detention camps set up there in 1992.
The appeals court said the original sentence was inappropriate.

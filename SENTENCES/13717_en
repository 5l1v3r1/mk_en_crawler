BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer met with Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski in Brussels on Wednesday (22 March), to discuss parliamentary elections in the Balkan country later this year.
The NATO chief also praised the progress achieved by Skopje thus far, particularly in terms of police reform and boosting the presence of minorities in state administration.
Buckovski, in turn, reiterated that Skopje hopes to get an invitation to join NATO in 2008.
In Skopje, meanwhile, construction officially began on a new US embassy.
US Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic said it would be a symbol of friendship, partnership and shared democratic values.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The second round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations between Serbia-Montenegro and the EU will begin in Belgrade on Wednesday (5 April).
Human rights, minority rights and implementation of political criteria are expected to dominate the agenda.
Holding this round of SAA talks had been conditioned on the arrest of top war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, but last week the EU decided to extend the deadline.

NEUM, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH government, together with the international community, will work on resolving the chief problems of the Roma population in BiH over the next four years, says Slobodan Nagradzic, the country's deputy minister for human rights and refugees.
Speaking Thursday (22 May) at a roundtable in Neum, Nagradzic said authorities at all levels should address the problems experienced by Roma people in the fields of education, housing and employment.
In other news, Macedonian police are trying to contain about 600 Roma refugees from Kosovo, who have already spent four days at the Macedonian-Greek border, seeking asylum.
Greek authorities repeatedly have refused to allow them to enter the country.
The refugees fled Kosovo in 1999 and do not want to return, citing safety concerns.

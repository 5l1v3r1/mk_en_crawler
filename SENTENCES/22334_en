BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO wants a fast resolution of the name dispute between Skopje and Athens, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told Macedonian Prime Minster Nikola Gruevski at a meeting Wednesday (October 15th).
"We want a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible, in order ...
to welcome Macedonia as a member," NATO spokesman James Appathurai told journalists later.
Macedonia is willing to compromise, said Gruevski, but he insisted on preserving Macedonia's "identity and dignity".
He acknowledged that the dispute remains the main obstacle to NATO and EU membership.
Gruevski also met with EU security chief Javier Solana, stressing that, as Macedonia has fulfilled all technical prerequisites, it expects an EU decision on implementing a visa-free regime next year.
Gruevski also met with US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker, who reiterated his country's support for Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration.
Meanwhile in Skopje, President Branko Crvenkovski said replacing the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with Republic of Macedonia-Skopje would be a "fair settlement".
This was a proposal UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz made before NATO's April summit in Bucharest, where Greece vetoed Macedonia's membership bid.
Crvenkovski and Gruevski will meet on Thursday to try to reach a joint stance on the name issue.
Both have concerns with Nimetz's latest proposal, unveiled last week.

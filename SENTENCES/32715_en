BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- In a surprise move Tuesday (17 December), the Yugoslav Parliament ratified the Dayton peace accord seven years after it was adopted.
The motion was backed by 75 of 138 deputies in the lower house.
The rest abstained.
The upper house, the Chamber of Republics, voted on the peace deal two months ago.
"By ratifying the Dayton accord we are sending a clear message from this parliament that we respect our obligations", Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic told the house before the vote.
He added that parliament's decision signals respect for the integrity and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

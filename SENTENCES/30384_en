ATHENS, Greece -- EU President Herman van Rompuy arrives in Athens on Tuesday (April 12th) for talks with President Karolos Papoulias and Prime Minister George Papandreou. 
He will also deliver a speech at the National Bank of Greece. 
Speaking to Kathimerini Monday, van Rompuy said that recent speculations about restructuring Greece's debt are rather "academic" and should not distract the government from its reform agenda. 
"Greece has only been implementing its programme for ten months and we have to allow time for the reforms to bring results," van Rompuy said.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Romanian President Traian Basescu kicked off a two-day visit to Washington Tuesday (8 March), with the aim of strengthening the US-Romanian strategic partnership at the political, military and economic levels.
Basescu met on Tuesday with leading NATO lobbyist Bruce Jackson.
They discussed security in the Black Sea region as well as the consolidation of democracies in that area.
Jackson noted that, given their admission to NATO and their expected entry into the EU in 2007, Romania and Bulgaria have become the success stories of Southeast Europe and the Black Sea region.
Basescu meets with US counterpart George W. Bush on Wednesday.

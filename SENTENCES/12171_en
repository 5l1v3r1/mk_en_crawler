SPLIT, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic reiterated Saturday (12 March) the government's position that EU accession talks should begin Thursday, as planned. 
During a visit to Split, Grabar-Kitarovic said the only obstacle is retired General Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's most-wanted indictees. 
EU officials have said Zagreb's failure to arrest and extradite him could jeopardise the start of the talks.
Also Friday, the OSCE Mission in Croatia voiced concern over the latest draft changes to the election law. 
Critics say the amendments could undermine the voting rights of many citizens, especially minorities.

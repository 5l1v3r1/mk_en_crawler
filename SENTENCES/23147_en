BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu summoned representatives of all parties in parliament Tuesday (July 1st) to discuss how to confront rising prices and limit their effect on the public's purchasing power. 
At the meeting, Basescu urged the parties to "show the utmost responsibility" in finding a solution to ease the effects of hikes in food and fuel prices, caused mostly by external factors. 
He also warned against imposing any populist solutions in light of the upcoming general elections this autumn. 
He says these remedies could adversely affect Romania's medium- and long-term prospects.

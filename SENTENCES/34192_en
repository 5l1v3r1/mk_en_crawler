PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Wednesday (9 July), Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic denied he was involved in an underworld deal to smuggle cigarettes into Italy, insisting the transaction was legitimate. 
Djukanovic's remarks came on the heels of highly publicised reports that an Italian investigating magistrate had issued a warrant for his arrest. 
An Italian judge subsequently nixed the warrant because Djukanovic enjoys immunity from prosecution. 
Italian investigators say cigarettes bought from the United States were shipped to Montenegro for storage after passing through Slovenia and Cyprus. 
The cargo was then allegedly smuggled into Italy using speedboats.

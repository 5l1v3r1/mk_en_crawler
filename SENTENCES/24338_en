BUCHAREST, Romania -- Around 6,000 Roman Catholics marched in Bucharest on Sunday (July 12th) to protest the planned construction of a high-rise office building next to a 19th century cathedral, media reported.
Protesters submitted a petition to the government saying the 19-storey building will threaten the foundations of the nearby St. Iosif's Cathedral.
In June, a Bucharest court approved construction of the "Cathedral Plaza" office building, despite concerns raised by the Roman Catholic Church, members of the European Parliament and US State Department.
The Church accused project developers of failing to obtain appropriate permits before starting construction in 2006.

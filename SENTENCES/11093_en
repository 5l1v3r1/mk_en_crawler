SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The OSCE mission that observed Sunday's (27 March) runoff local elections said Monday that the vote did not meet OSCE or Council of Europe standards. 
"Serious violations were again noted on election day in a number of areas of the country, including some where gross irregularities were observed" during the first round on 13 March, said Julian Peel Yates, head of the mission. 
During a news conference in Skopje, he criticised the government for failing to address problems that emerged during round one. 
Preliminary results show the ruling coalition won in 35 municipalities, but lost to the opposition in 18, including Skopje, Bitola and Prilep. 
Ali Ahmeti's ethnic Albanian Democratic Union of Integration won control of ten municipalities.

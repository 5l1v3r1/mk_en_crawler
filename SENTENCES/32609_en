SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and his federal counterpart from Serbia-Montenegro, Goran Svilanovic, signed an agreement Friday (28 February) to stimulate trans-border infrastructure development.
In particular, the document envisions a rail and motor highway between Sofia and Nis.
The project, part of pan-European Transport Corridor 10, aims to link the Balkans with Western Europe.
The sides agreed to quickly present results of feasibility studies to the Stability Pact, which oversees the corridor implementation, as well as to donors that would finance the project.

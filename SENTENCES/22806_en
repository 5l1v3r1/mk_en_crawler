SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A court in Sarajevo on Thursday (November 6th) sentenced a former Serb military police officer to seven years in prison for his role in the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
It convicted Mladen Blagojevic, 37, of willingly taking part in persecuting the civilian Bosnian Muslim population with a goal of committing inhuman acts. 
Three other suspected war criminals, Zdravko Bozic, Zeljko Zaric and Zoran Zivanovic, won acquittal on all charges and their release. 
The United States deported Blagojevic and Bozic in 2006, after authorities there found they received permanent residence permits based on falsified information about their past.

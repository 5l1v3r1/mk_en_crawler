ANKARA, Turkey -- Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres says Turkey could play an important role in the Middle East peace process, as it is both modern and Muslim.
During a visit Thursday (12 February), Peres said those attributes make Turkey an important potential member of the EU, as the Union could then play a more active role in the Middle East.
In other news Thursday, Amnesty International called on Turkey to do more to ensure human rights are protected, citing disparities between legal reforms and "facts on the field".

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (April 8th) turned down Radovan Karadzic's request to suspend his trial.
The former Bosnian Serb leader claimed a fair trial is impossible, as the court has already accepted thousands of items of evidence from earlier cases and testimony by witnesses without giving him the chance to cross examine them.
"The chamber is not satisfied that there has been any violation of the accused's right to a fair trial," the tribunal said in statement, adding that Karadzic will have the time he needs to present his own evidence.
The trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday.
Charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 BiH conflict, Karadzic has repeatedly sought to delay the trial.

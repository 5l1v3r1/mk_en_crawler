BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic announced on Tuesday (November 16th) that negotiations on a government reshuffle will start in January. 
Separately, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said that an evaluation will be conducted over the next couple of months in order to determine specific aspects of the reshuffle. 
Environment Minister Oliver Dulic backs the idea, hinting that it will improve the image of the current government before the 2012 parliamentary elections. 
Two of the remaining four parties in the ruling coalition, G17 plus and the Socialist Party of Serbia, say they are prepared to consider cutting the number of ministries in order to make public administration more efficient.

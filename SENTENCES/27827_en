STRASBOURG, France -- A meeting in Strasbourg between representatives of the Albanian government and the opposition has ended without any progress. 
Facilitated by European Parliament officials and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, leaders held a six-hour discussion that ran from dinner through late into the night Thursday (May 20th). 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha and opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama were given two more weeks to find a compromise, Fuele said afterwards. 
He and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton expressed their concern in a joint statement, which read in part, "Albania stands at a crucial moment on its path towards EU integration." (Top Channel, Shekulli, Klan, Ora News, News 24 - 21/05/10)

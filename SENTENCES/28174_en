ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic has authorised the extradition of Zemun Clan member Sretko Kalinic to Serbia, ministry spokesperson Vesna Dovranic confirmed on Tuesday (August 17th). 
Last week, Kalinic said he will not appeal the decision. 
Thus, he will become the first Croatian citizen to be extradited based on an agreement recently signed between Zagreb and Belgrade. 
Kalinic was arrested in Croatia in June after being shot by a fellow gang member. 
In 2007, he was sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison for the March 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Executive Committee of the Inter-European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development agreed Friday (2 July) to send a letter to Libyan authorities supporting the Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death earlier this year for allegedly infecting 400 children with HIV. 
Members of the Bulgarian Parliament attended the session in Brussels and presented Sofia's case.
Also Friday, Bulgaria and Romania signed agreements on two joint projects involving tourism and transport. 
The first concerns the drafting of a joint strategy to develop tourism between the cities of Giurgiu and Rousse. 
The second establishes a ferry connection between Zimnicea and Svishtov.

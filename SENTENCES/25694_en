SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Political directors of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board did not discuss transitioning the Office of the High Representative (OHR) into an office of the EU Special Representative, as the necessary preconditions have not been met.
The EU member states of the PIC Steering Board also stressed that BiH's EU membership application cannot be considered as long as the OHR exists.
The Steering Board wrapped up its two-day meeting in Sarajevo on Thursday (November 19th).
Afterwards, High Representative Valentin Inzko told reporters that the only concrete progress registered recently stems from work by an OHR team that is cataloguing state property.
That inventory should be completed in two to three weeks, he added.
Inzko said that the PIC Steering Board praised the progress BiH has made in meeting the criteria for visa liberalisation and encouraged the country to continue these efforts.

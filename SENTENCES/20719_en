ANKARA, Turkey -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn says Turkey should strengthen legislation guaranteeing the freedom of religion and expression. 
"I expect that (Turkish President Abdullah Gul) leads the transformation process and will ensure that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of Turkey," he told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag on Sunday (October 7th). 
In an interview with Turkish television NTVMSNBC on Saturday, Rehn said it was unacceptable that writers who criticise the Turkish identity are brought to trial. 
He was referring to Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code that makes insulting "Turkishness" a crime.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia can enter the EU when it meets the accession criteria, says Johannes Laitenberger, the spokesman for European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
Laitenberger was responding on Monday (October 1st) to a letter from Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, who urged all EU members to grant Serbia EU candidate status during Slovenia's EU presidency, during the second half of 2008.
Serbia's prospects were discussed this week during a meeting between EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
Laitenberger added that although Serbia had progressed well in talks on its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, the tribunal's opinion about whether Serbia has started to co-operate effectively would be decisive.

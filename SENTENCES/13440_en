SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government approved on Thursday (22 December) changes to the judiciary act, introducing greater transparency in appointing magistrates and prosecutors. 
The new rules would open the process to additional monitoring by the justice ministry, which would be able to better supervise procedures. 
Justice Minister Georgi Petkanov said the decision is just the first step towards the adoption of entirely new legislation covering the judicial system, in line with EU requirements.

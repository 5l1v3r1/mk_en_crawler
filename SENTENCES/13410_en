SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Thursday (25 August) endorsed the country's new penal code, amended to meet EU accession obligations. 
The draft changes, prepared by the former NMS-II-led administration, were approved almost unanimously by the 250-member legislature. 
Only the right-wing Democrats for Strong Bulgaria voted against the code, claiming the changes are purely cosmetic and would not address issues related to organised crime. 
Hours later, reputed crime boss Georgi Iliev, 39, was gunned down outside a club he owned in the resort of Slunchev Bryag. 
It was described as the latest in a string of mafia-style hits over the past few years.
In other news, the distribution of district governors' seats among the partners in the new ruling coalition -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), NMS-II and the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) -- is stirring controversy. 
A number of BSP and NMS-II municipal branches as well as other parties in several cities have objected to the idea of appointing governors from MRF in mainly Bulgarian-populated towns. 
In the Black Sea city of Varna, protests were held Thursday by NGOs backed by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party (SP) will recommend on Monday (November 26th) some changes to the country's draft budget for 2008, which was submitted to parliament a week ago, SP official Valentina Leskaj said on Sunday.
She says the recommendations came from specialists who emphasised the need for a better distribution of government funds across various sectors, especially in the judicial and healthcare systems.
A week ago, the opposition rejected the budget, claiming it will impoverish Albanians.

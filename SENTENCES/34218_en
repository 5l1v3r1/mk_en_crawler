BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Defence Minister Boris Tadic said Sunday (6 July) that the federal army is not protecting war criminals. 
He acknowledged that the army had previously been in contact with former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic, but only before the adoption of the law on co-operation with the war crimes tribunal. 
He added that the country would drop its charges against NATO immediately after Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina drop similar charges against Serbia.

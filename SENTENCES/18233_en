ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police and the Office for Combating Corruption and Organised Crime (USKOK) have smashed an international human trafficking ring, according to an announcement Wednesday (April 11th).
The ring is believed to have operated since mid-2005, taking immigrants towards Western Europe.
Some 39 people were arrested, with more sought.
An USKOK official says a huge amount of heroin was also seized during the investigation, aided by prosecutors from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia.

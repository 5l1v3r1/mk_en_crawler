NEW YORK, United States -- In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Wednesday (22 September), the chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) presidency called for the arrest of Radovan Karadzic and "thousands" of other alleged war criminals.
Sulejman Tihic told world leaders that suspects who remain at large pose a threat to regional stability and are often linked to organised crime.
He added that if UN mechanisms were more efficient during the 1990s, aggression against BiH might have been averted.
On Tuesday, Tihic met with US President George W. Bush, who reiterated his country's support for BiH and its efforts to join Euro-Atlantic structures.

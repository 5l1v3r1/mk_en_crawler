SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Customs officials seized 35.5kg of heroin Monday (January 5th) in a car with Dutch plates whose driver allegedly planned to cross into Serbia and continue to Western Europe. 
Authorities arrested the driver, a Turkish national, after confiscating the drugs in his possession at the Kalotina checkpoint on the Bulgarian-Serbian border. 
Police seized a total of 1.1 tonnes of heroin in Bulgaria last year.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Interior Ministry confirmed Sunday (23 March) the Zemun clan planned and executed the 12 March murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
The ministry said a thorough, joint investigation by police and the state security services determined the clan is responsible, adding more than 1,000 people have been arrested and some 3,000 detained.
Also on Sunday, newly appointed Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Boris Tadic denied that former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic enjoys protection from the national army.
He added that the army has no knowledge of any war crimes suspects being in the country, despite claims to the contrary by prosecutors at The Hague.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The return of Montenegrin representatives to Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal depends on the outcome of a meeting of the state union's leadership, according to Montenegrin Deputy Foreign Minister and council member Predrag Boskovic. 
In an interview in Tuesdayâ€™s (19 October) Belgrade daily Novosti, Boskovic says Podgorica would decide on the issue if talks called by Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic with the presidents and prime ministers of the two republics result in a firm agreement on the European perspective of the state union.
In other news, a delegation from the Serbia-Montenegro Defence Ministry is spending five days in the United States.

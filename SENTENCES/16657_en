PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Outgoing Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic on Tuesday (November 7th) dismissed Serbian criticism of Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku's visit last week to Podgorica.
Officials in Belgrade accused Montenegro of virtually recognising Kosovo as an independent state by welcoming the leader of the provincial government.
But Djukanovic said the future status of the province was not discussed.
"Whatever Kosovo becomes in the future, it borders Montenegro," he said.
Djukanovic steps down as prime minister Wednesday, and will be succeeded by Justice Minister Zeljko Sturanovic.

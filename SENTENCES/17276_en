BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu opened talks Monday (May 28th) with all the parties in Parliament, except for the nationalist Greater Romania Party. 
The main focus is on changing electoral legislation, introducing a majority voting system and forming a stable majority in government. 
Basescu returned to the presidency last Thursday, after voters rejected a move to impeach him.
After Monday's discussions, the leader of Basescu's Democratic Party (PD), Emil Boc, said his party wants early general elections this October. 
It also plans a no-confidence motion against the current minority government of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, head of the National Liberal Party. 
The prime minister, Boc said, should assume responsibility for the failed impeachment referendum against Basescu. 
For his part, Tariceanu described the consultations as a sign that the ongoing political crisis could be overcome.
A third key player, Mircea Geoana, chairman of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, said Romania needs a stable and efficient cabinet and the time for early elections has passed.

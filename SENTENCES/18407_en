ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb County Court's out-of-court panel announced on Monday (December 11th) that it decided to abolish a recent ruling by the court's investigating judge to suspend the trial against parliament member Branimir Glavas.
He is accused of war crimes against ethnic Serbian civilians in Osijek in 1991.
After he was detained, he staged a 37-day hunger strike.
Citing his deteriorated health, the investigative judge decided to release him from custody and adjourn the trial.
That prompted the appeal by prosecutors to the out of-court panel.
In other news, the board of the national Croatian Radio Television (HRT) company said on Tuesday that it would hold an urgent meeting to discuss the case of three journalists and an editor, suspended from the HRT Information Programme for broadcasting a controversial video clip of a speech President Stipe Mesic made in the early 1990s.
HRT's management cited violations of internal regulations and unprofessional conduct.
The Croatian Journalists' Association and the Reporters Without Borders NGO say the firings amount to censorship and demanded the journalists be given their jobs back.
In the speech, Mesic seemed to glorify the Nazi-style Ustashe regime that ran Croatia during WWII.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Detroit Pistons forward Mehmet Okur is among the top Turkish athletes, community leaders and artists who will carry the Olympic torch through the streets of Istanbul on Tuesday (6 July). 
He left Turkey in 2001 to play basketball in the United States and became the first Turk to play on an NBA title team. 
Also carrying the torch will be Naim Suleymanoglu, the Bulgarian-born Turkish weightlifter who won a record three gold medals in three successive Olympics.

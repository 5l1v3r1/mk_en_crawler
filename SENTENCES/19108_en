SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU envoy to Skopje, Erwan Fouere, again urged the country's political parties on Wednesday (February 28th) to agree on a list of laws, due to be adopted under the so-called Badinter principle. 
Stipulated in the Ohrid Peace Accords, the principle acknowledges that some types of bills require approval by a specified minimum of minority party deputies in Parliament. 
Fouere says compiling such a list would help resolve the deadlock between the ruling VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition and the ethnic Albanian opposition Democratic Union for Integration. 
It has been boycotting Parliament for weeks, accusing VMRO-DPMNE of violating of the Badinter-related legislative requirements.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- European Parliament member and rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, says it is time for the EU to set a date to launch accession talks date for Macedonia, local media reported on Thursday (September 30th). 
In an interview with NTV, she also voiced hope that Skopje and Athens, through UN mediation, will resolve their long-standing name row. 
Fajon stressed that the EU's policy is not to intervene in bilateral disputes, rather, to assist in finding a solution.

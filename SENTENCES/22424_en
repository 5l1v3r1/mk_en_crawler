ANKARA, Turkey -- The military says Turkish troops have killed 22 members of the terrorist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) over the last five days in an operation in the southeast near the Iraqi border. 
On Monday (July 14th), the military said two Turkish troops and three PKK fighters died in clashes in Sirnak province. 
Turkish jets struck PKK bases there and in the eastern province of Hakkari for hours. 
A group of 40 PKK militants attempting to cross the border came under fire from F-16s, according to the daily Sabah. 
After the bombings, the army launched an artillery salvo and reportedly seized a large number of weapons and explosives from the PKK bases.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Turbo-folk diva Svetlana Ceca Raznatovic has accepted a plea bargain with prosecutors in which she would plead guilty to embezzlement charges in exchange for a year in prison and a fine of 1.5m euros, local media reported on Monday (April 11th). 
The year would likely be spent in home detention rather than behind bars. 
Ceca was charged with misappropriating millions of euros while trading football players from the Obilic club she headed to foreign clubs.

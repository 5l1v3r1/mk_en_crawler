SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Court of BiH ruled Saturday (24 January) that three former Croatian officials -- Ante Jelavic, Miroslav Prce and Miroslav Rupcic -- may be held for 30 days.
They were detained last week and accused of having links to organised crime.
Officials deny allegations that excessive force was used during the arrests.
In other news, more than 70 per cent turnout was reported for Sunday's referendum in Mostar's three predominantly Croat-populated municipalities.
At issue is a proposed city reorganisation.
Officials say 99 per cent supported the idea of one municipality and one election unit.

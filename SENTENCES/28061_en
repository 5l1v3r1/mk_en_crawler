ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) submitted a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor on Wednesday (October 20th).
The motion was supported by 58 lawmakers from the SDP and other opposition parties.
The opposition blames Kosor for the decline in living standards, the economic contraction, as well as a rising unemployment rate, foreign debt and budget deficit.
The vote is to take place within 30 days and requires the support of at least 77 of parliament's 153 members.
It has little chance of succeeding, as the government currently has the support of 83 members.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said Sunday (18 April) that the Serbian government must be reshuffled. 
He said his G17 Plus party would insist on changes in executive power and would like to see the Democratic Party join the government after the presidential elections. 
"This would in effect become a majority government and would lead to far greater political stability in Serbia as well as support for reforms the present government is implementing," said Dinkic, adding that foreign investors would applaud such changes.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos arrived Sunday (25 May) in Athens for a three-day visit. 
He will meet with Greek President Constantinos Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister Costas Simitis, the first direct meeting of Greek and Cypriot leaders since the Turkish Cypriot regime decided to lift travel restrictions on the island a month ago. 
The Greek Cypriot government has commended the move but says it does not resolve underlining problems.

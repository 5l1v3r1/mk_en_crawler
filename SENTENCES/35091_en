ANKARA, Turkey -- The government on Sunday (27 June) rejected the demands of militants in Iraq threatening to behead three Turkish hostages, as NATO leaders gather in Istanbul.
Militants loyal to suspected al-Qaeda ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi said in a statement to Al Jazeera television on Saturday that the three hostages would be executed within 72 hours unless Turks stopped working with US-led forces in Iraq.
Zarqawi's group beheaded a South Korean hostage last week.
"Turkey has been fighting terrorist activity for more than 20 years," Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters in Istanbul.
"They demand many things.
We never consider them with seriousness."
In other news, the EU summit in Dublin ended Saturday with US President George W. Bush calling for the start of accession talks with Turkey.
"As Turkey meets the EU standards for membership, the EU should begin talks that will lead to full membership for Turkey," he said.

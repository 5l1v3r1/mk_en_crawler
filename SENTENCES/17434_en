ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer denied plans Friday (April 20th) to enter politics after his term expires on May 16th, saying the idea hadn't occurred to him.
Asked to comment on what kind of successor he would favour, Sezer said he would approve what the media would approve.
Recently though, Sezer and Chief of General Staff Yasar Buyukanit have made several comments insisting the next president should be loyal to secular principles.
Their statements implied disapproval of a bid by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, known for his Islamic beliefs.
He is expected to announce whether he plans to run on Wednesday.

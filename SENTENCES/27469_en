TEHRAN, Iran -- Vice-President Hamid Baghaei on Sunday (August 29th) denied making comments about the 1915 killing of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.
"We are rejecting the news reports attributed to me in some media outlets," Baghaei said.
His comments came after Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu demanded a personal explanation from the Iranian official, who was quoted as saying last week that "a hundred years ago, the Ottoman Empire committed genocide against a certain number of Armenians." Shortly after that, the Iranian Embassy in Ankara issued a statement explaining that Baghaei's words were wrongly reflected by some media.

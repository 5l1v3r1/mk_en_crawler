BELGRADE, Serbia -- A group of anarchists calling itself Crni Ilija claimed responsibility Tuesday (August 25th) for an attack on the Greek Embassy in Belgrade hours earlier. 
A group of young people had thrown two Molotov cocktails at the building, breaking a window and causing slight fire damage.
In a statement e-mailed to local media, the anarchists called for the release of Thodoris Iliopoulos, who was arrested in Greece last December. 
He allegedly threw an explosive device during a demonstration against the police killing of a teenager earlier that month. 
Iliopoulos, who insists he is innocent, launched a hunger strike last month to protest his continued detention.

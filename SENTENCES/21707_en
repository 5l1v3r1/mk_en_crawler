PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN Security Council discussed the quarterly report on Kosovo, presented by UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker on Monday (April 21st). 
While the debate focused on reducing UNMIK's role in the newly independent country, Serbia's upcoming elections and achievements made by local institutions, it seemed to underscore the deep divisions in positions held by Security Council members. 
The US and British ambassadors criticised Serbia's decision to hold local elections in Kosovo, warning it "would not be helpful". 
But Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin insisted that "Serbs have every right to conduct their parliamentary and municipal elections when they see fit."
Serbian President Boris Tadic attended the debate, as did Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who was making his first such appearance since his country declared independence on February 17th.

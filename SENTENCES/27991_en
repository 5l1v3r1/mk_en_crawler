BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) urged the Serbian and Macedonian governments Thursday (October 21st) to prevent the abuse of visa-free travel by their citizens. 
"The Serbian and Macedonian authorities should do this together with the EC and member-countries of the EU, and it is with this aim that the high officials of Belgium and the EC have travelled to Belgrade and Skopje," EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs Cecilia Malstrom said in an official press release. 
Earlier this year, visa-free travel unleashed a wave of asylum seekers who cited economic hardships, but were later sent home. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic says Serb authorities are working closely with EU member states that have seen a rise in asylum seekers.

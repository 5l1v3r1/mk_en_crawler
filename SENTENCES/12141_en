PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Visiting Pristina on Friday (13 May), NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said there would be a review of standards for Kosovo only if there is further progress on implementation.
The NATO chief said his visit, along with members of the North Atlantic Council, was aimed at reaffirming the Pact's continued political commitment to Kosovo, as well as assessing the fulfilment of internationally set standards.
He cited some encouraging signs, including the cautious resumption of the Pristina-Belgrade dialogue and new Serb readiness to participate in local institutions.
De Hoop Scheffer stressed that efforts should be stepped up to protect minorities and in the decentralisation process.
He added that future political talks between Pristina and Belgrade should extend beyond technical matters.

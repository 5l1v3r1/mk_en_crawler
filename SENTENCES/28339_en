SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry confirmed on Friday (May 14th) that another big weapons stash -- including munitions and explosives -- was seized in an operation in Novo Selo late Thursday.
Four people were arrested.
The interior ministry says they appear to be linked to a group of four killed in a police shootout near Radusa and Rasce, by the Macedonian-Kosovo border, early Wednesday.
That case also involved suspected weapons trafficking.

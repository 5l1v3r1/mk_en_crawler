SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- For the first time, a court in Republika Srpska (RS) has handed down a war crimes conviction against Bosnian Serbs. 
Former police officers Dragan Radakovic and Drasko Krndija were sentenced to 20 years in prison for murdering six Muslims, including two women, in the northwestern town of Prijedor in March 1994. 
A third indictee, Radoslav Knezevic, received a 15-year sentence. 
One of the men, Krndija, is still at large and was tried in absentia. 
The court's ruling was issued at a session Thursday (17 November).
Meanwhile, police in the Federation of BiH said Friday that two more suspects were apprehended in connection with an alleged terrorist plot. 
A Swedish citizen, a Turk and a Bosnian were arrested in October on suspicion of conspiring to attack international targets. 
The Bosnian has since been released.

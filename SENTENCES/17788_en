BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday (March 22nd) to suspend the corruption trial of former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, after defence lawyers challenged the legality of the case.
"The court acknowledged the claim of unconstitutionality â¦ and decided to send the case to the Constitutional Court for review," a spokesman for the Supreme Court said.
Nastase is charged with blackmail and with accepting 1.4m euros in bribes, when he was the speaker of the lower chamber.
He says the charges are politically motivated.
His wife faces separate charges.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government has allocated 300,000 euros for the reconstruction of Albanian houses in the Serb-dominated northern part of Mitrovica.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci acknowledged on Thursday (September 3rd) that local institutions faced a challenging situation as a group of Serbs have prevented reconstruction efforts for days.
He added that the government will support the return of all displaced persons.
"No extremist, despite its nationality, can take away anyone's right to return and enjoy life in a new independent Kosovo," Thaci said.
The statement followed a week of incidents in the northern part of the divided town.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) has started to collect money in the Serb-dominated town of Strpce, which was hit by power cuts last month because of unpaid bills, local media reported on Friday (July 31st).
KEK workers are collecting the agreed amount of 26 euros per household through seven field teams escorted by Kosovo police.
The agreement on payment was signed by the government-appointed mayor, Stanko Jakovlevic.
Electricity supplies to the region are expected to be fully restored once residents pay 70% of what is owed.

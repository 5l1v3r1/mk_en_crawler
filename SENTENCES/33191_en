DUBLIN, Ireland -- Croatia will meet all conditions for joining the EU by the end of 2006, according to Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan, who spoke to reporters on Saturday (14 June) during a visit to Ireland. 
Racan was responding to a statement earlier in the day by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who said Croatia might close negotiations in 2008 or 2009 on joining the EU.
Also Saturday, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski visited Croatia. 
He vowed to back the country's EU and NATO aspirations, which he described as "a path that Poland has already taken".

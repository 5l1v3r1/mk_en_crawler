BELGRADE, Serbia -- Presidential elections will probably be postponed to 2008, local media reported, citing a statement Monday (October 15th) by Nada Kolundzija of the Democratic Party.
She says her party agrees with its partner in the ruling coalition, the Serbian Democratic Party (DPS), led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
The DPS argues that elections should not coincide with the final phase of the Kosovo status talks, which are scheduled to end on December 10th.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Six people were injured by a strong explosion at a workshop in the resort of Antalya on Saturday (February 28th).
Two of the injured are in critical condition.
According to the initial investigation, a gas leak sparked the blast, which badly damaged a nearby building and a passing taxi cab.
In other news, investigators are still working to determine what caused a Turkish Airlines 737 to crash near Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.
Analysis of the flight data and voice recorders continues, with preliminary results expected this week.
At a press conference Friday, the Turkish Pilots Association suggested it may have been the result of strong turbulence, brought on the passing of a larger plane as the Turkish airliner made its landing approach.

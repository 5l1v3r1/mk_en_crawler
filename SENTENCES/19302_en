Belgrade, Serbia -- Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said on Tuesday (August 28th) that if Belgrade and Pristina agree on the partition of Kosovo, his government would support the solution, as should the UN Security Council. 
Verhagen visited Belgrade and Pristina on Tuesday (August 28th) and became the first EU country foreign minister to say that a possible division of Kosovo into a Serb-dominated and an Albanian-dominated part is acceptable. 
Belgrade and Pristina, however, have both said they oppose partition.
After his meeting with Verhagen, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo would be illegal, invalid and dangerous. 
Former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari, who has recommended supervised independence, also warned Kosovo against declaring independence now.

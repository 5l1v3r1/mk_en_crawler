NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Police Chief Iacovos Papacostas resigned on Thursday (June 18th) after the completion of an investigation into last year's escape of a notorious criminal.
The probe, by the public prosecutor's office, concluded the escape was facilitated by corrupt police officers.
Antonis Kitas, known as "Al Capone", fled a private hospital in Nicosia in December.
He was serving a life sentence for the brutal rape and murder of two foreigners in 1994.
On Friday, Attorney General Petros Clerides said prosecutors will file criminal charges against six police officers and prison guards in connection with the escape.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry says it is watching with concern the election-related unrest in neighbouring Moldova. 
Thousands of protesters stormed the parliament and presidential headquarters in Chisinau on Tuesday (April 7th) to challenge the legitimacy of the Communist Party's win in Sunday's parliamentary elections. 
Romania urged both authorities and protesters in Moldova to refrain from violence and provocation. 
Its statement noted that violence against state institutions is unacceptable but stressed the importance of respecting the "inalienable right of assembly". 
The ministry expressed hope the incidents would not hamper Moldova's European integration prospects. 
Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin accuses Bucharest of encouraging the unrest and says Romania's ambassador is no longer welcome in his country. 
Opposition leaders say protests will continue.

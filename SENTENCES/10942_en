ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan described terrorism as the "worst calamity for humanity" during a speech to the nation Friday (29 July) broadcast on all domestic TV channels. 
He again called for mutual will and a "sincere" approach in fighting international terrorism, saying terrorists strike indiscriminately, not based on language, religion, nation, race or country. 
He added that the government is working to overcome social and economic problems that could be "nourishing" terrorism. 
Also Friday, Istanbul Deputy Police Chief Sammaz Demirtas said Turkish security services expect that al-Qaida will strike the country again. 
He added that 1,000 Turks are under some form of surveillance for suspected ties to the terrorist organisation.
In other news Friday, Turkey signed an accord extending its customs union with the EU to Cyprus and other new EU members -- a key step towards opening membership talks with the bloc -- but stressed its signature was not recognition of the Cypriot government.

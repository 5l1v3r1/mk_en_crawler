ATHENS, Greece -- Archaeologists have found evidence on a Greek island of what may be the oldest sea voyages by humans, the culture ministry announced on Monday (January 3rd).
Experts from Greece and the United States have discovered primitive axes and other tools believed to be 130,000 and 700,000 years old, in shelters on the island of Crete, which is about 40 miles off the mainland.
It has been separated from it for about 5 million years, so, according to the scientists, whoever made the tools must have travelled to the island by sea.
"The results of the survey not only provide evidence of sea voyages in the Mediterranean tens of thousands of years earlier than we were aware of so far, but also change our understanding of early hominids' cognitive abilities," the ministry said in a statement.

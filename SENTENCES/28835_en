ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament approved on Thursday (July 8th) a major overhaul of the country's pension system, which cuts benefits and raises the retirement age. 
The bill was passed by a vote of 157-134, as an estimated 12,000 protestors demonstrated outside. 
"This is a major reform â¦ In one stroke, we are putting the system on a viable path and safeguarding future pensions," Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said. 
The bill raises the retirement age to 65 for everyone and will also make it easier for companies to fire workers.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met on Thursday (November 23rd) with Hungarian counterpart Ferenc Gyurcsany, who told him Macedonia's goal of joining NATO in 2008 is realistic. 
However, Gyurcsany added, significant reforms must be implemented, especially those related to Macedonia's other goal of EU integration. 
The officials also discussed Macedonia's new economic reforms, particularly selected tax cuts and efforts to create a free trade zone aimed at attracting more foreign investment.
Also Thursday, Macedonia launched its first Special Operations Regiment. 
The new unit is part of the defence reform strategy, aimed at creating a mobile, well-trained professional army.

TIRANA, Albania -- Two weeks after receiving an invitation to join NATO, the government established a negotiating group Wednesday (April 16th) that will lead the effort to make that membership a reality. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha predicted that with continuing reforms, Albania will join the Alliance sooner than expected. 
"There should not even be a single issue from our side that will postpone this historic process," he said.
In other news Wednesday, Albania signed four financial agreements with the European Commission aimed at boosting cross-border development. 
Regions that will profit most are near the borders with Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia.
Also Wednesday, parliament's legislative committee approved a series of proposed changes to the constitution. 
One would limit the term of the country's chief prosecutor to five years. 
Another would change the electoral system from a mix of majority and proportional systems to a regional proportional system. 
A third would place oversight of the Central Elections Commission under the Election Code rather than under the constitution. 
The changes move next to the full parliament for consideration.

ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds of students affiliated with the Communist Party gathered outside the parliament building Monday (March 21st) to protest the government's support for the NATO-led operation in Libya.
The protestors carried anti-government banners and shouted slogans against the bombings, torching the EU's flag before the demonstration began.
A similar scene unfolded on the island of Crete, where protestors marched to the Souda Bay naval base that provides command and logistics support to US and NATO-led operations.

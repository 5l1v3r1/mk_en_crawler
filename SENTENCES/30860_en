PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Ending supervised independence depends on the progress of the Kosovo government and of the International Civilian Office's (ICO) implementation of the Ahtisaari Package, International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith said on Thursday (May 5th). 
The Ahtisaari Package will be implemented across Kosovo by fully respecting the country's territorial integrity, Feith said after meeting with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. 
Both officials agreed that Kosovo institutions should continue their consolidation in order for the supervised independence process to be completed.

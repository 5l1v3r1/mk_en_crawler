BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday (February 13th) called on Serbs living in Kosovo to stay there, despite the expected declaration of independence by the breakaway province. 
"For the Serbian government, each Serb in Kosovo is a full citizen of Serbia and it is our duty to do everything possible to guarantee normal living conditions for our compatriots," he told Tanjug.
Meanwhile, Reuters reported Wednesday that barricades have appeared on roads in the northern part of Kosovo predominantly populated by Serbs. 
The so-called "new faces", or Serb security force staff, have been deployed in Mitrovica and on the bridge over the Ibar River.

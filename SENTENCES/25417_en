SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government announced on Thursday (March 25th) plans to cut the salaries of state employees, in light of the global economic crisis. 
"When everybody suffers, everybody has got to suffer," Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said after a cabinet meeting.
Also Thursday, parliament finally adopted changes to the penal prosecution code, a benchmark in the European Commission's co-operation and verification mechanism. 
The amendments aim to facilitate court proceedings, but not everyone is onboard. 
Lawmakers with the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms walked out in protest.

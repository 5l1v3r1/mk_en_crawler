There are no indications that there will be any changes in our approach to Kosovo," Kay told a press conference after the new Kosovo Security Force became effective at midnight on Tuesday.

In other news, those challenging President Fatmir Sejdiu's decision not to hold elections this year can forward their complaints to parliament. 
According to media reports Thursday, Assembly Secretary General Ismet Krasniqi said his secretariat will receive appeals intended for the constitutional court until the court's own secretariat is established. 
Sejdiu wants to hold the next general elections in 2011, which the opposition says is totalitarian.

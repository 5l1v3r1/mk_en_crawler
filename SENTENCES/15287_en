TIRANA, Albania -- A parliamentary session Friday (28 July) was suspended after debate over the election of a new Central Election Commission (CEC) member escalated into confrontation among ruling party and opposition MPs. 
The incident came after the parliamentary committee on legal affairs approved a CEC candidate endorsed by the ruling majority, rather than the opposition Socialist Movement for Integration's candidate. 
The opposition says the move violated a previous agreement.
Verbal arguments reportedly turned into shoving matches, and opposition lawmakers atttempted to prevent voting on the nomination by blocking the parliamentary hall. 
They remained there until late evening, even though Parliamentary Speaker Jozefina Topalli ordered the electricity in the building to be switched off.

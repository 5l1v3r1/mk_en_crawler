PRISTINA, Kosovo -- NATO Commander of the Allied Joint Force Command in Naples, US Admiral Mark Fitzgerald, said on Tuesday (December 15th) in Pristina that 2009 has been a successful year for Kosovo.
"Two rounds of successful elections, security continues to improve, and the Kosovo Security Force is now functional," Fitzgerald said after making his last visit to KFOR troops this year.
Their numbers will be reduced in January from 14,000 to 10,000.
Commenting on the recent opening of a military base in southern Serbia, near the border with Kosovo, Fitzgerald said it represents no threat to Kosovo.

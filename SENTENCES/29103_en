SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic was acquitted on Friday (November 5th) of charges of crimes against humanity committed in 1992 in Bosanska Krupa.
Two fellow former Bosnian Serb officials -- Mladen Drljaca and Jovan Ostojic -- were also declared not guilty due to lack of evidence.
The three were charged with involvement in the organised expulsion and imprisonment of non-Serb civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Prosecutors vow to appeal the acquittals.

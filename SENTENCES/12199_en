PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic kicks off a landmark visit to Kosovo on Sunday (13 February), following an agreement with the UN. 
He is to tour several Serb enclaves and meet with UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen. 
It was not clear whether Tadic would see any of the province's ethnic Albanian leaders during his two-day visit. 
UN police and KFOR said they planned no additional security measures, but a spokesman for the peacekeepers said KFOR would monitor the president's movements and intervene if there is unrest.

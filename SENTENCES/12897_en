ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey introduced a new currency on Saturday (1 January) ending an era when most basic products cost a million lira or more.
One new lira is equivalent to 1m of the old notes.
The transition went smoothly, with only a five-minute interruption of ATM services.
The old currency will remain legal tender until the end of 2005.
The mayor of Istanbul, meanwhile, cancelled all New Year's festivities in the city out of respect for the hundreds of thousands of people killed in the Asian earthquake and tsunami disaster.
A number of popular singers had been scheduled to perform in Istanbul's Taksim Square.
In other news, Turkish media reported on Monday that two Turkish nationals suspected of having links to the al-Qaeda terrorist network have been extradited from Pakistan.
The two, identified as Mehmet Yilmaz and Mahmut Kaplan, were arrested there last summer.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament elected Dusko Markovic, head of the National Security Agency (ANB), as a minister without portfolio on Friday (July 30th). 
He will be working mainly in areas of national security and issues related to the EU and NATO. 
Markovic will be replaced at the ANB by Vladan Jokovic, who has been at the agency since the end of the 1990s. 
His nomination, however, is only advisory, as the actual decision rests with the prime minister.

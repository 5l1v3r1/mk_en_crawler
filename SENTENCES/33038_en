SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government asked parliament Thursday (22 May) to approve the deployment of troops to Iraq.
The cabinet plans to send a 500-strong battalion, following a request from the United States last month to take part in post-war reconstruction.
President Georgi Parvanov said then that it was the country's moral and political duty to respond to the request.

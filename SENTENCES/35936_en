SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria will begin rotating its battalion in Iraq on Thursday (15 January).
At a ceremony Wednesday in Kazanluk, Army Chief of General Staff Nikola Kolev said 62 of the 480 soldiers have asked to leave the unit, following the 27 December suicide bombing in Karbala, which killed five servicemen and wounded more than 60.
There were more than 100 volunteers for the new vacancies, according to Kolev.
On Tuesday, the government raised pay for the troops.
In other news, Bulgarian Finance Minister Milen Velchev and his Turkish counterpart Kemal Unakitan met Wednesday about bilateral relations and joint projects.
They discussed planned measures to facilitate border crossings at Kapitan Andreevo checkpoints on the Bulgarian-Turkish border, as well as construction of a new checkpoint near Lesnovo.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Peace Implementation Council will meet on October 30th regarding sanctions it plans to impose, following the failure of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) politicians to agree on police reform.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak met with the six-member Contact Group in Brussels on Monday (October 15th), acknowledging the setback over the past year could not be ignored.
He says most of the blame falls on RS political leaders, whom he says ended up ignoring three EU principles approved early on in the process.
In Luxembourg on Monday, the EU foreign ministers wrapped up their meeting with a statement of full support for Lajcak and his efforts to introduce reforms in BiH.
The EU Council also reiterated that a police reform agreement in line with the three EU principles remains a key requirement for BiH to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

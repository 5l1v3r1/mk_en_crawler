BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Eurozone members and the IMF announced on Sunday (May 2nd) they have agreed on a 110 billion-euro aid package for Greece over the next three years. 
The EU will provide 80 billion euros of it, while the rest will come from the IMF. 
The first tranche is to be released before May 19th, when Greece is to make its next debt repayment. 
The deal must still be approved by some parliaments in eurozone member countries and by the IMF. 
In return for the aid, Greece must implement sweeping austerity measures, including scrapping bonuses for public employees, banning increases in public sector salaries and pensions for at least three years, increasing the VAT rate from 21% to 23%, raising fuel, alcohol and tobacco taxes by 10% and taxing illegal construction. 
The goal is to raise 30 billion euros over the next three years, to bring the country's ballooning budget deficit back under the European threshold of 3% of GDP.

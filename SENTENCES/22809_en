TIRANA, Albania -- Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Thursday (November 6th) that the European Commission's (EC) report on Albania's progress criticises the country for the high level of corruption.
That contradicts the positive spin the government had offered.
"Prime Minister [Sali Berisha] is incompetent, but he continues to mention success when in reality he is being criticised," said Rama.
On Wednesday, the EC published its annual report on the progress of Western Balkan countries on their road to EU accession, saying Albania has advanced in key reforms and has played a constructive role for peace in the region.
Transparency International (TI) also questioned the government's interpretation of the progress report.
TI says Albania is interpreting the report from a different perspective and including speculation in its interpretation.

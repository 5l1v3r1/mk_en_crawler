ZAGREB, Croatia -- Visiting Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis hailed Croatia's progress Monday (January 15th) and said the country could serve as an example to the rest of the region in terms of Euro-Atlantic integration.
His comment followed talks with Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader in Zagreb.
Sanader praised the "friendship and support" between the two countries.
He thanked Athens for backing Croatia's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member in 2008.
While in Zagreb, Karamanlis also pledged that his government is determined to eradicate terrorism.
He vowed the Greek authorities would be "uncompromising and ruthless", and called for "seriousness, responsibility and above all unity".
His comments came a few days after a rocket attack on the US Embassy in Athens.
Later on Monday, Karamanlis travelled to Ljubljana, where he attended a reception marking Slovenia's entry into the Eurozone.
Tuesday, he wrapped up his tour of the region with a trip to Belgrade.

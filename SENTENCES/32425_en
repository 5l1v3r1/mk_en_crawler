BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte visited the grave of slain Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic on Friday (21 March), bringing flowers and lighting a candle. 
Afterwards, at a seminar in Belgrade, she called Djindjic "a crucial force in co-operation" with the tribunal. 
Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said the "real reason for the assassination of Zoran Djindjic is the wish of those who are suspected or indicted by The Hague-based tribunal to protect themselves from arrest." Justice Minister Vladan Batic was quoted as saying some 1,000 suspected mafia members are in custody, though the actual assassins remain at large.
Also Friday, EU leaders attending a summit in Brussels signalled their readiness to provide additional assistance requested by Belgrade. 
Details are expected during a meeting of the foreign ministers next month.

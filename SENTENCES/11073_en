LUXEMBOURG -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte insisted Tuesday (26 April) that fugitive Ante Gotovina is in Croatia. 
Addressing members of the EU assessment task force on Croatian co-operation with the UN tribunal at its first meeting in Luxembourg, she took issue with Croatian government claims that the former general is beyond the reach of authorities. 
The task force also heard from Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who again said the government is unaware of Gotovina's whereabouts. 
The EU postponed entry talks with Croatia in March, citing Zagreb's failure to arrest him.
In other news Tuesday, the OSCE Mission to Zagreb presented a report that acknowledged progress in the conduct of war crimes trials in Croatia. 
According to the document, the odds of Serb defendants receiving a fair trial have improved recently, though additional efforts were encouraged.

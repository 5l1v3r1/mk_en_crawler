ZAGREB, Croatia -- State chief prosecutor Mladen Bajic said Thursday (14 October) that the crime rate in the country increased by three per cent in 2003, compared to 2002.
While downplaying the increase, he voiced concern over the growing rate of unsolved crimes, most involving property.
He noted, however, that drug-related crime seems to be falling.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase announced Saturday (28 February) that he will reshuffle his cabinet to create three "superminister" posts. 
The new officials will be tasked with co-ordinating efforts in various sectors in the closing stages of EU accession. 
Economy Minister Dan Ioan Popescu will be in charge of all economic questions; Interior Minister Ion Rus will oversee all social and administrative issues; and Ioan Talpes, the president's advisor on domestic security, will have responsibility for issues relating to European integration, justice and defence.
In other news, the European Commission announced that it would launch an investigation into how EU funds were spent in Romania's Suceava region. 
The move came after two local officials were found to have awarded 275,000 euros in contracts to their spouses.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic began consultations Monday (October 9th) with the parliamentary parties, aimed at naming a new prime minister-designate and forming a new government.
After Vujanovic gives the mandate to a premier-designate, parliament has 60 days to vote on his or her proposal for a new cabinet.
Last week, leaders of the Democratic Party of Socialists, which won the September 10th parliamentary elections, suggested the party would make Justice Minister Zeljko Sturanovic its prime minister-designate.

ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament voted on Friday (19 March) to elect a woman as speaker for the first time in history. 
Anna Psarouda-Benaki, a 63-year-old lawyer and member of the New Democracy Party, ran unopposed for the post. 
Women took 35 seats in elections earlier this month.
In other news, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis assured parliament on Saturday that preparations for the Olympics would be completed in time. 
He made these remarks shortly after organisers abandoned plans to build a roof over the Olympic swimming pool. 
He also reiterated his government's resolve to make the Games as secure as possible in the wake of the Madrid terrorist attacks.

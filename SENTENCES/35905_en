ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Assistant Interior Minister Josko Moric appeared as a witness Saturday (17 January) before The Hague war crimes tribunal, testifying that Croatia had neither planned nor covered up war crimes in the country.
Moric handed over documents aimed at clearing Croatian authorities, documents Moric says UN investigators had not seen before.
In related news, Croatian Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt said the UN tribunal reacted positively to government plans to establish a specialised department for co-operation with The Hague.
Meanwhile, the EU's ambassadors to Croatia met in Zagreb on Friday to discuss the country's political and EU accession reforms, including efforts to co-operate with the tribunal.On Sunday, however, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Croatia's bid to join the Union in 2007 looked too ambitious.
In an interview for the German <I>SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung </I>, he cautioned that the target date set by Croatian authorities could result in serious disappointment.

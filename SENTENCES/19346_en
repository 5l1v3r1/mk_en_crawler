ZAGREB, Croatia -- Concerned that accession talks with the EU could be blocked because of Croatia's protected environmental fishing zone in the Adriatic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader reiterated on Monday (February 25th) that his government wants multilateral talks including all affected parties -- Italy, Slovenia, Croatia and the European Commission.
"We have been waiting for two months for an answer to my proposal for a quadrilateral meeting during which we would outline certain solutions," Sanader told national radio.
He says it seems the parties are avoiding it.

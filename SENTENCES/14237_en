SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The cabinet approved a draft agreement Thursday (12 January) to alleviate the visa regime with neighbouring Macedonia. 
A similar accord was approved for Serbia-Montenegro a week ago. 
Under the agreements, once Bulgaria enters the EU and becomes an outer border of the Union, Macedonian and Serbia-Montenego citizens will be allowed to enter without visas for a short stay of 90 days or less.
In other news, Bulgaria is poised to assume command of the first ever-peacekeeping mission by the South-Eastern Europe Brigade to Afghanistan. 
The troops are due to leave for Kabul from Romania on Monday. 
Their mission will last for six months.

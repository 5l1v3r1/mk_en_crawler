BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The liberalisation of BiH's visa regime with the EU depends on the ability of local authority to meet the requirements, says Osman Topcagic, head of the BiH directorate for EU integration.
In an interview published in the Banja Luka daily Nezavisne Novine on Monday (May 19th), Topcagic said the EU would present the roadmap for liberalisation of the visa regime in a week.
BiH will need to meet certain benchmarks in the fields of personal document security, border management, and illegal migration, Topcagic explained.

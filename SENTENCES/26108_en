ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government approved a revised version of its anti-corruption plan on Thursday (March 18th), cutting the number of measures, but expanding the number of panels and ministries implementing them. 
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor says the revision emphasises monitoring proper implementation of funds made available through various grants, and says the plan will also focus on greater transparency in the financing of political parties. 
Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic noted that the revised plan was developed in co-operation with the European Commission.

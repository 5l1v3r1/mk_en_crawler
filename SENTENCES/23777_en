ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Friday (December 19th) that an internet campaign to apologise for the "Armenian genocide" will harm Turkey.
"This is a sensitive issue for Turkey.
There is a negotiation process going on [with Armenia] ...
This kind of debate is of no use to anyone, especially at a time when talks continue and it may harm the negotiation process," Babacan said.
The controversial campaign was launched in mid-December by a group of Turkish intellectuals and academics.
More than 5,000 people support it, including President Abdullah Gul.

ATHENS, Greece -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Sunday (8 June) that Greece is making satisfactory progress in preparations for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
IOC inspector Denis Oswald says he hopes work on a key football stadium and a project for a glass-metal roof at the main Olympics stadium would not run into "unexpected problems".
In other news, Greece's highest administrative court has cancelled the construction of a village planned to house 4,000 of the 20,000 journalists expected to cover the Olympics.
AP reports the decision also froze a housing unit for security personnel.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Justice Minister Anton Stankov said Monday (21 October) that he would fully support constitutional changes that affect the judicial system. 
The right-wing opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) has presented several amendments, and wants 24 changes adopted before next year's local elections. 
Apart from administrative decentralisation, UDF is proposing fewer seats in parliament, reduced immunity for prosecutors, and limited military authority for the presidency. 
Stankov says he believes that the ruling coalition will also back some of the proposals.

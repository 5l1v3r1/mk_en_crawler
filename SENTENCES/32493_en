ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister-designate Recep Tayyip Erdogan has no plans to set up his new government Friday (14 March), according to local television reports.
The reports quoted Erdogan as saying he still has not completed his list of ministers.
The United States and nervous investors have been urging the rapid establishment of his government so parliament can vote again on the US request to deploy troops on Turkish territory.
Erdogan had earlier said he might visit the president Friday to submit his cabinet.
On Thursday, meanwhile, parliament decided to hold an extraordinary session over the weekend to debate the new government's platform.It remains unclear whether lawmakers will vote on the government motion to allow the US troops.
While Erdogan supports it, lawmakers from his Justice and Development Party have said that they would prefer to act following the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on Iraq.
In other news, Turkey's Constitutional Court has banned the country's most popular Kurdish party, accusing it of links to extremists.
It also banned 46 leading members of the People's Democracy Party from politics.
The ban lasts five years.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown told reporters Friday (25 February) that the country is ready to hold war crimes trials on its own.
A new War Crimes Council is due to open in Sarajevo on 9 March, with UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte expected to attend the inauguration ceremony.
While praising BiH for having passed a "significant milestone on the road to sovereign statehood", Ashdown reiterated his call to Republika Srpska authorities to demonstrate full co-operation with the tribunal.

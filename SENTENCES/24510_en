BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Thursday (May 7th) urged all member states to complete the process of enlargement and accept Southeast European countries within their ranks.
"Let's finish the job in Southeast Europe ...
as the principles of freedom and democracy, respect for human rights and freedoms that the EU is founded on, demand of us," Rehn said in a speech to mark May 9th, Europe Day.
He stressed that the Western Balkan countries -- Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina -- are constantly progressing on the road towards the EU.
Brussels expects that Turkey will also fulfil the necessary reforms, he added.
"Compared to other regions of the world, Southeast Europe enjoys relative political stability, and its European perspective is responsible for that," Rehn said.

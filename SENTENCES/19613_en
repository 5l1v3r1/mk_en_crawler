TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi signed a decree Friday (March 21st) approving the resignation of Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, following the series of deadly blasts at an ammunitions depot in Gerdec on March 15th. 
Mediu is a member of the second largest government coalition party, the Republican Party. 
He is being replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Gazmend Oketa of the Democratic Party. 
The Republican Party says it's freezing its participation in the government until those actually responsible for the tragedy are identified.

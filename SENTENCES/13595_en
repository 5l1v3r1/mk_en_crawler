ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Istanbul's Sisli court has dropped its case against Turkey's most prominent writer, Orhan Pamuk.
He had been charged with insulting the Turkish national character by referring to the killings of Armenians during World War I. The case raised concerns in the EU about freedom of speech in Turkey.
The justice ministry sent a letter to the court saying that it did not have the authority under the new Criminal Code to authorise the writer's trial.
The court reportedly dropped the case on the ministry's recommendation.
The trial was to resume on 7 February.
In other news, Tajik President Emomali Rahmonov wrapped up a visit to Turkey on Sunday.
The trip resulted in an agreement to enhance bilateral co-operation in the political and economic sectors.

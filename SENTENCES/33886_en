ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey plays a very important role in the stability of Europe and the world, EU security chief Javier Solana said Thursday (13 November), adding that its role is clear even now, before the country begins negotiations for EU membership.
In an interview for the local TV channel TRT 2, Solana stressed that while finding a solution to the Cyprus dispute would benefit all sides, it is not a political prerequisite for launching EU membership negotiations with Turkey.

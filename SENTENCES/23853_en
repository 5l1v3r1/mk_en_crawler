TIRANA, Albania -- Police arrested 16 people across the country Saturday (April 18th) and charged them with "computer fraud".
The operation targeted a ring whose members were cloning pay-per-view digital TV platforms.
Police began investigating the group in Tirana in October and later broadened the probe to other major cities where there was similar trading of pirated products.
Digital TV has been gaining popularity in Albania since 2004.
Three domestic operators provide it.

ANKARA, Turkey -- US Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Saturday (September 4th) that Washington does not plan to use Turkish territory to pull out heavy equipment and weapons from Iraq. 
"We do not transport weapons through Turkey, nor do we plan to in the future," Mullen said at press conference in Ankara.
On Friday, Mullen met with Turkey's new Chief of the General Staff, General Isik Kosaner, and Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul. 
On Saturday he held talks with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Mullen's official visit began shortly after US President Barack Obama announced the end of US combat operations in Iraq.

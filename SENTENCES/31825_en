ANKARA, Turkey -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell met Turkish leaders on Wednesday (2 April) to discuss closer co-operation between the two countries in addressing the conflict in Iraq.
Ankara agreed to let the United States use its territory to re-supply its troops in northern Iraq.
On a separate matter, Powell said there was no need for a deployment of Turkish forces in Iraq, noting that a mechanism has been established to address problems that may arise in the region.
Ankara is worried there could be moves to create a Kurdish state in northern Iraq, which it says would revive armed Kurdish separatism in southeastern Turkey.
Powell assured Turkish officials that the situation in northern Iraq is under control.

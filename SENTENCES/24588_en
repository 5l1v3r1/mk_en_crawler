ATHENS, Greece -- Several thousand people gathered in Athens and the second largest city, Thessaloniki, on Tuesday (July 7th) to protest xenophobia and racism, media reported. 
Protesters denounced government plans to toughen measures against illegal immigration, and recent police operations that targeted illegal immigrants. 
But clashes erupted, with some protesters lobbing Molotov cocktails at police. 
They responded with tear gas and flash grenades. 
Beefed up measures against illegal immigrants include longer detentions: 12 months, instead of three. 
New detention centres may be established at old military bases across the country.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's leaders met on Thursday (March 11th) to discuss a variety of constitutional amendments, such as adjusting the formula used to choose State Judicial Council members. 
Currently, the council has 15 members -- eight are elected by judges, three by parliament and two are nominated by the president. 
After the meeting, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said other proposed changes would be to eliminate the justice ministry's representation in the council and to shorten the council members' terms, currently six years. 
Gruevski said the aim of the proposed amendments is to boost judicial independence and efficiency.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev is on a daylong working visit to Brussels on Monday (29 August), his first official trip abroad since assuming office this month. 
Stanishev will meet with European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and other EC members to assure them that the new government will compensate for any delays in reforms caused by the slow formation of a new cabinet following the June elections.
Also Monday, the new US ambassador to Bulgaria, John Ross Beyrle, assumed his official duties. 
He succeeds James Pardew in the post.

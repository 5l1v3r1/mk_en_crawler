SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Tripartite Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic announced on Tuesday (March 17th) that he would write to the presidents of countries worldwide, seeking support for BiH's non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council, which the council will approve or reject by year's end.
"It is an obligation of everyone in BiH to make efforts on this road, regardless of their personal opinion on the matter," Radmanovic said.

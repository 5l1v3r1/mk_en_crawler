ATHENS, Greece -- The Ministry of Citizens Protection announced on Monday (October 26th) a 600,000-euro reward for information leading to the arrest of three anarchists suspected of a series of bank robberies in 2006. 
The announcement came amid the new government's vow to eradicate local anarchist and radical leftist groups responsible for bombings in Athens. 
According to the announcement, anyone who provides information about the suspects -- Simeon Seisidis, Marios Seisidis and Gregory Tsironis -- will be guaranteed anonymity. 
The trio has been on the run since the robberies three years ago.

TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament adopted a law Monday (February 21st) for repatriated Albanians from Europe, excluding them from customs tax in order to assist their reintegration.
The returnees, be they volunteer or returned by force, will be able to bring personal and business equipment without taxes to start a new career in their homeland, as required by the EU.
They will also be offered consultations regarding investments, loans and accommodations.
Furthermore, their children will receive specialised coursework and curriculum.
The opposition supported the measure, but said the government should have provided cost analysis.

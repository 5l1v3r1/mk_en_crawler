SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian expressed his support for the corruption watchdog NGO Transparency International BiH (TI BiH) on Thursday (July 3rd).
Earlier this week, Republika Srpska (RS) Milorad Dodik said he was aware of malpractice on the part of TI BiH, including the racketeering and blackmailing of certain RS businessmen.
Gregorian met with TIBH representatives and said afterwards the organisation "has never been contacted by police, questioned or served any notice by the courts.
There have been repeated announcements by representatives of the RS government of legal action against the organisation which has never resulted in concrete action.
If anyone believes that there is a civil or criminal case to be answered, it should be done through the courts, and not public statements." (OHR website, Fena - 03/07/08)

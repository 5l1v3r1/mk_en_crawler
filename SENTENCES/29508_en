BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Criminal bands are quickly redirecting their activities to Southeast Europe and are becoming increasingly brutal in their actions, Europol warned on Friday (July 30th).
According to the pan-European police agency, gangs related to the Hell's Angels and Bandidos biker clubs are moving to Albania, Bulgaria and parts of Turkey.
"New alliances between outlaw gangs mean that they get the capability and capacity ...
to manage drugs trafficking via southeast Europe using the 'Balkan route'," Europol warned, urging authorities to work closely together and exchange information.
Reacting to the report, however, the Bulgarian Interior Ministry said Saturday it has no information confirming that criminal bike gangs are active in Bulgaria.

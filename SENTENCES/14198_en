ANKARA, Turkey -- The man who may have tried to kill Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week appears to be a troubled Turkish nationalist disappointed with the authorities' handling of attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party.
"The government is doing nothing while our soldiers are being martyred every day," Mustafa Bagdat told police interrogators.
In other news, Turkey will provide $2.5m in cash and humanitarian assistance to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, the foreign ministry in Ankara said on Tuesday.

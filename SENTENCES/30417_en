WASHINGTON, United States -- IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in an interview that if he were Greek, he would probably have demonstrated against the country's austerity measures as well.
"Of course, people don't like it ...
It's tough, difficult," Strauss-Kahn said, according to a transcript of an interview with PBS Thursday (December 16th).
"It means demonstration, protesters, which I can understand;
and you know if you were, if I were -- I was a Greek citizen, maybe we would be demonstrating the same way because people find it unfair," Strauss-Kahn added.
At the same time, he pointed out that "most people do understand that there's no other way.
Decades of mismanagement have to be solved in a couple of years." (AFP, Reuters - 16/12/10)

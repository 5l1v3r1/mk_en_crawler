BRUSSELS, Belgium -- On Friday (18 July), European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen expressed optimism about reforms of the Romanian judicial system. 
If the reforms continue at the same pace, he said, negotiations on the Justice and Home Affairs chapter could be completed by year's end. 
Verheugen's comments came during a meeting with Romanian Justice Minister Rodica Stanoiu in Brussels. 
The EU commissioner stressed the importance of keeping all political efforts focused on judicial reform. 
Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, says the objective is to close pre-accession talks with the EU next year.

MADRID, Spain -- The United States and the EU called on the OSCE on Thursday (November 29th) to continue its mission in Kosovo. 
At the OSCE annual summit in Madrid, Portuguese Foreign Minister Luis Amado, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said the OSCE should renew its mission in Kosovo for another year, regardless of the result of the Kosovo status negotiations and events that might follow the December 10th deadline.
The United States and the EU also expressed deep concern over an announcement that Russia would withdraw next month from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which limits the deployment of tanks, aircraft and other heavy weapons across the continent.

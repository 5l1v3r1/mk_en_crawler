SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov said on Tuesday (5 July) that he sealed a decree scheduling the new parliament's first session for 11 July. 
Parvanov's statement came after he officially obtained a report by the Central Election Commission with the results of the 25 June vote. 
The date 11 July was proposed by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms -- the first and third largest powers in the new legislature, respectively. 
They held talks last week on forming a coalition cabinet. 
On Monday, BSP leader Sergey Stanishev met again with the leader of the current ruling party NMS-II, Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, to discuss forming a common government. 
No details were released.

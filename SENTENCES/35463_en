TIRANA, Albania -- Representatives of nine right-wing opposition parties met on Wednesday (11 February) to discuss possible joint action against the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano. 
The meeting was organised by Sali Berisha's Democratic Party (DP). 
Berisha said one objective was to bring together right-wing parties that are not part of the DP-led "Union for Victory". 
However, Genc Pollo's New Democratic Party refused to join the group.

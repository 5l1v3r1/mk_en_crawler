PRISTINA Kosovo -- The government has set a deadline of June 30th for Serb police officers to return to their jobs.
The decision Wednesday (April 15th) followed recommendations by the rule-of-law working group comprised of local and EULEX representatives.
Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti stressed that the deadline should not be perceived as a punishment for the Serbs, but as a concrete step to building a multi-ethnic police department.
Serb police officers have boycotted the force since Pristina declared independence in February 2008.
They want a chain of command run by UNMIK's international officials.

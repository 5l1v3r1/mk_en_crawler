SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH will not withdraw charges of aggression and genocide filed against Serbia-Montenegro at the International Court of Justice, BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic said Wednesday (28 July).
Serbian President Boris Tadic had proposed that Croatia and BiH withdraw wartime charges in return for Serbia-Montenegro withdrawing charges against NATO over its action during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Thursday (25 November) that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made considerable progress in the nine years since the Dayton Accord brought an end to the conflict there. 
In an open letter to all citizens on the occasion of Statehood Day, Ashdown outlined some major events this year that demonstrate BiH is on the road to stability and development. 
He cited work under way by the state-level courts, successful local elections in October, and the reopening of the historic Mostar Bridge. 
He noted that two major goals remain: entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme and starting talks on the Stabilisation and Association Process with the EU.

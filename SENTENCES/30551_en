BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU General Affairs Council confirmed at its meeting Tuesday (December 14th) that Western Balkan countries have membership prospects. 
The EU foreign ministers concluded that these countries should continue to implement political and economic reforms, though each country should be assessed based on its own achievements. 
Strengthening the rule of law, via judicial reform, and boosting efforts against corruption and organised crime remain crucial and require sustained efforts, they noted. 
They also said Kosovo would benefit from the visa liberalisation process once it fulfils all necessary criteria, especially in the judicial and security area. 
The council hailed progress the region has achieved towards reconciliation and regional co-operation.
In the section on Croatia, the council said that accession talks are in their final stage and "conclusion of the negotiations is within reach". 
The ministers welcomed the European Commission's positive assessment of Montenegro's membership application and said the recommendation to grant EU candidate status will be considered by the European Council at its meeting this week. 
The group also called on newly elected Bosnian leaders to engage in constructive political dialogue and to continue implementing reforms stemming from the EU agenda. 
The ministers also reaffirmed the EU's readiness to facilitate the upcoming dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. 
The Council noted that it will consider the EC recommendation to open accession talks with Macedonia during the next EU presidency.

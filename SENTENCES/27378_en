TIRANA, Albania -- Police in Albania and Kosovo arrested three suspected members of a drug ring, Albanian authorities said on Thursday (May 27th).
One was arrested in Tirana;
the other two were stopped by authorities in Prizren, southern Kosovo.
Police suspect that the ring smuggled drugs from Albania to Kosovo, and owned a stash of 110 kilos of marijuana that abandoned in November not far from the capital.
Kosovo authorities confirmed the arrests and the suspects' apparent connection to an international drug trafficking network.
EULEX says the drugs were destined for Western Europe.

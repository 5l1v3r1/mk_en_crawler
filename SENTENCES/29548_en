SYDNEY, Australia -- Police are searching for former Serb militia commander Dragan Vasiljkovic, who is awaiting extradition to Croatia to face a war crimes trial, authorities announced on Wednesday (March 31st).
The Australian High Court on Tuesday overturned a lower court ruling, clearing the way for the extradition.
Known as "Captain Dragan", Vasiljkovic is accused by Zagreb of involvement in the 1991 torture and killing of Croatian civilians and prisoners of war in the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin, and in the southern village of Bruska in 1993.
He failed to appear in court Tuesday to hear the ruling.

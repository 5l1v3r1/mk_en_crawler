TIRANA, Albania -- A new report by the OSCE mission in Tirana strongly criticised the deteriorating political climate in Albania for affecting the implementation of set reforms. 
The report, released to the media at the weekend, said damage is being done to the electoral process. 
Much-needed reforms ahead of the next municipal vote virtually have been stalled by squabbling between the main two parties -- the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party.

TIRANA, Albania - Socialist Party leader Edi Rama met with predecessor Fatos Nano on Thursday (June 14th), after two years of testy exchanges. 
"This is the start of a new process of co-operation and joint values that will increase the competitive abilities of the opposition in the political arena," Nano said. 
They discussed Nano's presidential bid and platform ahead of the June 20th election. 
The opposition says it will boycott the first round unless the ruling collation agrees to organise roundtable discussions aimed at reaching a consensus candidate.

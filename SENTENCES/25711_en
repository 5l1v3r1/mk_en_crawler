BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes court acquitted two former Serb policemen Tuesday (September 22nd) charged with the torture of three Albanian brothers with US citizenship -- Illy, Mehmet and Agron Bytyqi -- who were killed in 1999.
Their bodies were found in 2001 in a mass grave in the eastern village of Petrovo Selo.
Judge Vesko Krstajic said prosecutors failed to prove the charges against Sreten Popovic and Milos Stojanovic during the hearings.
"Having listened to over 50 witnesses and experts, we came to the conclusion that they were not guilty," the judge said.
The two were initially charged with collaboration in the murders but the indictment was later amended.
They allegedly handed the Bytyqi brothers over to members of a special Serbian police unit who shot and killed them in their training camp.
Prosecutors say they will appeal the ruling.

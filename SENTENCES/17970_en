NEW YORK, United States â The United States and the EU on Tuesday (May 16th) urged the politicians of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to focus on the reforms that are required to get their country closer to EU membership.
"It is incumbent on all of Bosnia's leaders to set aside destabilising rhetoric and focus on issues that matter for the welfare of Bosnia's citizens," US Deputy Ambassador Alejandro Wolff said during an open meeting of the UN Security Council on BiH.
Germany's permanent representative to the UN, Thomas Matussek, said BiH is expected to merge its two entities' police services, streamline its public administration, amend the constitution and improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling, who also attended Tuesday's meeting, said the country's leaders should stop nationalistic feuds and resume work on reforms.
He also mentioned the Srebrenica controversy, saying that he hopes that newly-appointed envoy Clifford Bond and entity authorities will create prerequisites for a lasting return process in the region.

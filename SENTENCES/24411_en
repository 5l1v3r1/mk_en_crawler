PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament held a ceremonial session Wednesday (April 8th) to mark the first anniversary of the adoption of Kosovo's constitution.
Speaker Jakup Krasniqi noted "there is still difficulty in implementing the constitution throughout Kosovo, especially ...
where Serbian government parallel structures still exist." The constitution won approval on April 9th 2008 and became effective on June 15th.
In other news Wednesday, former special UN envoy to Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari said he is optimistic that Russia will recognise Kosovo's independence, now that relations between Washington and Moscow are improving.
Ahtisaari won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, in part for his efforts to resolve Kosovo's status.
He told Voice of America that he is disappointed that some EU member states haven't recognised Kosovo's independence.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Tuesday (March 24th) that Romania will sign an agreement with the IMF and the EU in ten to 14 days after receiving a reply to the government's letter of intent.
The cabinet is expected to approve this letter at its meeting Wednesday.
The technical agreement will include a multilateral financing package for Romania worth up to 18 billion euros to help maintain economic stability amid the global financial crisis.
In other news, the Supreme Court decided on Tuesday to again postpone the trial of former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.
He faces charges of corruption stemming from fundraising during his 2004 presidential campaign.
The court rescheduled the hearing for April 15th.
Nastase insists the charges are politically motivated and that President Traian Basescu "ordered" his trial.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's leading Kurdish politicians urged Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) extremists on Thursday (18 August) to declare a ceasefire and work towards a peaceful settlement.
"It is an urgent, vital and general expectation from the PKK ...
to take as soon as possible a decision for a ceasefire, without conditions and time limits, in order to ensure a democratic ground for discussing the [Kurdish] problem, free from a climate of violence," read the appeal by the Democratic Society Movement (DTH), a formation that groups Turkey's most prominent Kurdish political figures.
In a landmark speech last week, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged the Kurdish conflict would be resolved with "more democracy".
He acknowledged that Ankara mistreated Turkey's Kurds in the past and said the government is open to dialogue.

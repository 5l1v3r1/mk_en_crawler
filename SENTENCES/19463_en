SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) will become a member of the European People's Party (PPE) on February 6th, party leader Tsvetan Tsvetanov said on Thursday (January 24th). 
The move, he said, will legitimise GERB as a right-wing party. 
PPE membership has been the goal of the party's informal leader, Boyko Borisov, who cannot serve as official chairman because he is mayor of Sofia. 
Borisov hopes membership in the EU-wide group will allow him to effectively claim leadership of Bulgaria's political right wing. 
GERB will become the fifth Bulgarian party to join the PPE.
Also Thursday, the newly established parliamentary caucus Bulgarian New Democracy (BND), made up of defectors from the Movement of Stability and Progress, officially offered to form an alliance in parliament with the United Democratic Forces. 
BND member Lidia Shuleva said the partnership could evolve into a new right-wing formation, attracting additional voters.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Constitutional Court ruled on Monday (March 28th) that the parliamentary procedures used to elect Behgjet Pacolli as president violated the constitution.
"Behgjet Pacolli was elected in an unconstitutional procedure," the court said, voting7-2 in favour of a complaint filed by two opposition parties.
The full verdict is expected later this week.
Under the constitution, the parliament can elect a president with 2/3 of lawmakers present, and with at least two candidates running for the post.
In Pacolli's case, neither of the conditions was met:
all opposition parties boycotted the session, and Pacolli was the only candidate running, on behalf of an alliance between the Democratic Party of Kosovo and the New Kosovo Alliance.

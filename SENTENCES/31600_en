BUCHAREST, Romania -- The official results of the census conducted last March suggests that the population declined by nearly 1 million in ten years to 21.7m people.
The National Statistics Institute noted two major reasons Thursday (16 January):
negative natural growth rate and emigration.
Those factors also reduce the percentage of people in the work force.
Some 2.3m people were defined as being members of non-Romanian ethnic groups.

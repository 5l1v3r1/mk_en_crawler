BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt predicts that next year will be a key one for Serbia, as its citizens would decide during parliamentary elections which of "two Serbias" to choose.
In an interview published in the weekly Nedelnji telegraf, Polt said one road leads forward and the other backwards, via radicalisation.
As regards co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Polt said that government action plans are no substitute for real action.

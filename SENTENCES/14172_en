SOFIA, Bulgaria -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso reaffirmed on Wednesday (14 September) that Bulgaria would become an EU member, but was cautious about specifying an exact date.
After talks with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov in New York, Barroso said that the EC's final position on Bulgaria's readiness to join in 2007, as planned, would be clear next spring.
Activation of a safeguard clause could delay Bulgaria's accession by one year depending on whether set reforms are met.
In other news, popular Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov submitted his resignation Wednesday, citing recent changes that reduced his powers.
Local media reports suggested he may be positioning himself to run for mayor of Sofia late next month.

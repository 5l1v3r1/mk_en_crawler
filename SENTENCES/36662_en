BURSA, Turkey -- Officials say police have foiled a bomb plot targeting NATO's June summit in Istanbul that will be attended by world leaders. 
Police detained at least 16 members of Ansar al Islam, a terrorist organisation linked to al Qaeda, the governor of Bursa said in a statement Monday (3 May). 
Oguz Kaan Koksal said police confiscated a large number of weapons and explosives in the raid in Bursa, 250km south of Istanbul, as well as CDs documenting the plot. 
Authorities said the arrests were based on a yearlong investigation. 
Istanbul suffered a series of devastating suicide truck bomb attacks in November, in which 61 people were killed. 
Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for those attacks.

SPLIT, Croatia -- Journalist Josip Jovic was released from the jail in the southern coastal city of Split on Thursday (13 October). 
He was detained a week ago on an international arrest warrant issued by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague after failing to appear at a 26 September hearing to enter a plea. 
Jovic is charged with contempt of court for allegedly publishing the identity of protected witnesses in the newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija. 
He was released Thursday after promising to travel to The Hague when ordered to do so.

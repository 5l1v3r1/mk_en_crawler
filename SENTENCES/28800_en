BELGRADE, Serbia -- More than 140 people were injured in clashes between protesters and police in downtown Belgrade on Sunday (October 10th).
About 6,000 people had gathered in an effort to disrupt the gay pride parade in the capital, hurling petrol bombs and rocks at police officers who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Among those injured were 124 police officers and 17 protesters.
Eleven police cars and three fire-fighting vehicles were damaged, several cars were torched and shop windows were smashed.
Hooligans also torched part of the building housing the ruling Democratic Party.
Authorities say 207 people were detained, about half of whom remained in custody for violent behaviour.
Hours passed before order was restored.
Belgrade Mayor Dragan Djilas said damages could total about 1m euros.
The parade itself brought together about 1,000 people who walked the streets without incident.
Addressing participants, Minister for Human and Minority Rights Svetozar Ciplic, head of the European Commission delegation to Serbia Vincent Degert, head of the OSCE mission to Serbia Dimitrios Kypreos, and representatives of several political parties and NGOs said discrimination must not be tolerated.
President Boris Tadic strongly condemned the violence against police, and reiterated the country's determination to protect all its citizens, regardless of differences among them.
The government defended the right to freedom of expression and vowed to punish those responsible for the vandalism.
Sunday's parade was the first since 2001, when marchers were beaten by ultranationalists, football fans and skinheads.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government named a new military chief Monday (31 July) who favors a tougher line against Kurdish rebels.
General Yasar Buyukanit, 66, head of the land forces, was appointed chief of staff by the cabinet, replacing General Hilmi Ozkok, who retires in late August.
Military promotions are closely watched in Turkey, where the staunchly secularist army maintains political influence, although a series of EU-demanded reforms have eroded its powers.
The change also comes as the United States urges Turkey to contribute to a possible peacekeeping force along the Israeli-Lebanese border.

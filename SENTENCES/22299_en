ANKARA, Turkey -- Tens of thousands of people gathered in Ankara's Tandogan Square on Saturday (April 12th) to support the secular character of the state.
The rally was organised by NGOs that accuse the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of threatening secularism.
Participants chanted "We are soldiers of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk)!" and other slogans.
There were also calls against Turkey's EU accession.
The demonstration was peaceful.
Also Saturday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wrapped up a three-day visit to Turkey by calling for compromise between defenders of the secular character and supporters of more religious freedom.
In Istanbul, Barroso told Foreign Minister Ali Babacan that reforms can only be implemented based on consensus.

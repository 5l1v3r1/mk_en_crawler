BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government said Thursday (11 September) that the country has fully optimised its EU pre-accession funds, and may be the first of the EU candidates to have done so.
The country has started work on 33 projects worth 1.2 billion euros.
This figure constitutes 70 per cent of the entire 2000-2006 financial assistance package awarded to Romania as a EU candidate.
Hopes are high that five more projects will begin by year's end.

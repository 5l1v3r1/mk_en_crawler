BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) has welcomed the agreement reached between the prime ministers of Croatia and Slovenia -- Ivo Sanader and Janez Jansa -- to refer an ongoing bilateral border dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
In a statement for Jutarnji List on Tuesday (August 28th), EC spokesman Michael Mann said the fact that the two countries managed to agree on the arbitrator is an important step forward.
He added that the EC hopes the two governments would now intensify negotiations aimed at resolving all other outstanding issues.
Mann also urged Croatia not to unilaterally declare a special ecological and fishing zone in the Adriatic.

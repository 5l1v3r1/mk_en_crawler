BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The international community commended authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for the results achieved thus far in the realisation of a six-month action plan adopted over the summer.
During a meeting of international and BiH officials in Brussels Wednesday (10 December), participants agreed that continuation of the foreign financial assistance is essential for the completion of reforms.
In other news Wednesday, the BiH House of Peoples passed the law on indirect taxation, without a controversial provision in the draft adopted by the House of Representatives last week.

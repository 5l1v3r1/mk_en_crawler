BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The OSCE Mission to Serbia-Montenegro welcomed co-operation accords between Serbia's Public Prosecutor Slobodan Jankovic, War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic and Croatia's State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic. 
The agreements were sealed in Belgrade on Saturday (5 February). 
According to OSCE Ambassador Maurizio Massari, the document is crucial, as it is expected to enhance the joint fight against organised crime, international terrorism, war crimes, human trafficking and money laundering. 
It was signed within the framework of a conference dedicated to transferring responsibilities for war crimes proceedings from The Hague tribunal to domestic courts in former Yugoslav countries.

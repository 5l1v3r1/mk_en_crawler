SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson has again called for establishment of a joint defence ministry and a joint military headquarters in BiH. 
The BiH Presidency says it received a letter to that effect on Friday (15 November), just days after High Representative Paddy Ashdown and SFOR Commander Gen William Ward noted that creation of a single defence structure is the main pre-condition for accession into NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.

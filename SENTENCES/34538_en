SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO spokesman Mark Laity told A1 TV on Friday (3 October) that Macedonia has an ambitious programme for reforms aimed at full NATO membership.
There are real efforts at progress but a long way to go, Laity said.
He added that, as of now, it is difficult to set an exact date for NATO membership.
In other news Friday, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said parliament should pass the national defence strategy -- a key document for NATO membership -- in the beginning of February.
He was participating in a two-day roundtable on security along with dozens of domestic and foreign experts and parliamentarians.

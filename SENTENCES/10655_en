SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The results of the referendum earlier this week on the country's new decentralisation laws prove that Macedonia is fully committed to Euro-Atlantic integration, said Donald Anderson, chairman of the British Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee.
During a visit to Skopje on Thursday (11 November), he met with Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski and Teuta Arafi, chairwoman of the foreign policy committee.
Anderson said Britain is ready to assist Macedonia in the reform process and recommended intensified judicial reforms.

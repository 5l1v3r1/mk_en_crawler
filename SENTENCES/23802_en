PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN concedes that most people in Kosovo view UNMIK as an obstacle, which makes it difficult for local institutions to exercise their duties in line with the constitution, local media reported on Thursday (March 19th).
The UN Security Council's latest quarterly report on Kosovo states UNMIK faces many challenges in fulfilling its duties in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni is expected to speak at a council session Monday, where he will request UNMIK's mandate to terminate and transfer all of its competencies to the EU-led mission, EULEX.
In other news Thursday, Spain announced plans to withdraw over 600 troops from Kosovo by the end of June.
Spanish troops have served with KFOR since its launching in 1999.
Commenting on Spain's decision, NATO spokesman James Appathurai said in Brussels that Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was not happy because Spanish authorities failed to consult the Alliance in advance.

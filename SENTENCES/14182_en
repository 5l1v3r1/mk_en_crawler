BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Theodor Meron, president of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague (ICTY), visited Belgrade on Friday (11 November) to urge Serbian authorities to meet their outstanding obligations towards the ICTY. 
During talks with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and other top officals, he voiced concern over the level of co-operation, emphasising that actions and results are needed, rather than rhetoric. 
The international community has become impatient with "the endless delays in the fulfilment by Serbia of its remaining international obligations", Meron said.
In a press conference after the meeting, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said the tribunal has given Belgrade seven weeks to arrest Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, or face exclusion from the process of Euro-Atlantic integration.

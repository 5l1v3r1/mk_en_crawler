BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Democratic Union of Pensioners organised a protest rally in Banja Luka on Tuesday (14 October) urging the government of Republika Srpska to pay overdue pensions and to pass legislative amendments. 
More than 300 demonstrators gathered at the Krajina central square, complaining of financial difficulties. 
They demanded amendments to the pension and disability insurance act, and advocated higher payroll taxes that would result in pension hikes of 35 per cent.

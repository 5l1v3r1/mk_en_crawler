SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency's Bosniak member, Sulejman Tihic, officially requested Thursday (29 January) a reshuffle of the Federation of BiH (FBiH) government. 
Tihic, who leads the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), made the request in a letter to FBiH President Niko Lozancic and his deputies. 
The party argued that the government of Prime Minister Ahmet Hadzipasic, an SDA member, has failed to address the entity's acute social and economic problems. 
Lozancic's Croat Democratic Union criticised the government last week.
In other news, the US State Department issued a statement in support of international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown's decision to reunify the city of Mostar. 
Washington says the decree will "create the basis for a secure and prosperous future for Mostar".
Also Thursday, Ivica Rajic, a former military commander of the Bosnian Croats during the war, pleaded not guilty to all ten counts of an indictment against him at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
He is accused of crimes committed against Bosniaks in central BiH in October 1993.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Every party but the Democrats (PD) has accepted Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's invitation Thursday (August 16th) to hold new discussions on the date for European Parliament elections.
While the Social Democratic Party (PSD) quickly suggested December 9th, the PD appeared hesitant.
PD leader Emil Boc declined Tariceanu's invitation outright, though the party's vice-president, Cezar Preda, said the PD will honour it.
The 35 deputies representing Romania must be elected this year.
Political turmoil has postponed the vote, originally scheduled for May 13th.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Lawyers for former Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer Veselin Sljivancanin asked the UN war crimes tribunal Thursday (January 28th) to review his sentence. 
Sljivancanin was convicted of war crimes committed in Croatia. 
In May, the tribunal's Appeals Chamber ruled that Sljivancanin enabled the 1991 massacre of 194 Croatian prisoners of war, and more than tripled his initial sentence from five to 17 years. 
His lawyers say they have since found a witness to shed new light on the case.

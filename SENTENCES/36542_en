BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana said Friday (7 May) that his own bid for mayor of Bucharest would not affect the progress of EU accession negotiations. 
He insisted that that while his ministry's work is solid, the ministry of European integration is actually leading the talks.

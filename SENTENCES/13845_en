TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu has vetoed the law on legalisation of property and construction and returned it to parliament for revision, according to a press release from his office Friday (17 March).
The statement read that Moisiu objected to some clauses in the law that violate the free right to property, which is guaranteed by the Albanian Constitution.
In other news, Doris Pack, chairwoman of the European Parliament's (EP) committee for Southeast Europe, criticised Albanian Foreign Minister Besnik Mustafaj for a controversial remark he made last week about borders in the Western Balkans.
He had suggested that dividing Kosovo -- as Serbia has proposed -- could affect Albania's and Macedonia's borders with the province.
In comments Sunday, Pack stressed that any change to the existing borders of Albania, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro is out of the question.

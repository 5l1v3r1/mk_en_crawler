ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader reiterated on Monday (25 April) that his government would arrest and extradite retired General Ante Gotovina to the UN war crimes tribunal, if Gotovina were in the country. 
Sanader repeated, however, that recent intelligence reports suggest that the fugitive is not in Croatia. 
An EU task force on the matter meets for the first time Tuesday in Luxembourg. 
It will hold discussions with UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte and later with Sanader.
In other news, outgoing OSCE Ambassador to Croatia Peter Semneby praised the positive changes made in the country during the past three years. 
During a farewell news conference Monday, Semneby -- whose mandate expires Saturday -- said the political system in Croatia had matured and progress was made in most areas tackled by the OSCE.

PRAGUE, the Czech Republic -- EU foreign ministers reaffirmed on Saturday (March 28th) the EU's commitment to the Balkan countries' integration process. 
The Balkans remain on track for joining the EU despite the economic downturn in Europe, the ministers said. 
"The Balkans are a part of Europe, and therefore, they have to be a part of the EU too," said Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg. 
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country will take over the EU presidency in June, warned that crushing Balkan candidate countries' aspirations would have "devastating consequences". 
EU ministers also held talks with their counterparts from Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.

STRASBOURG, France -- Montenegro officially joined the Council of Europe (CoE) as its 47th member on Friday (May 11th).
The CoE Secretary General Terry Davis lauded the accession of Montenegro, which followed the proclamation of the Balkan state's independence one year ago, and urged the country to meet the subsequent membership responsibilities, such as the adoption of key CoE conventions.

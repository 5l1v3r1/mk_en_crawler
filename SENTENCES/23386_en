TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) kicked off its election campaign on Sunday (May 24th), four days ahead of the official start date as determined by the Central Electoral Commission. 
Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who leads the DP, said its candidates would give parliament a new level of efficiency. 
"You will be the authors of a great development, Albania will change in the next four years," Berisha told the candidates. 
He underscored the current government's successes in achieving NATO membership and submitting application for EU candidate status.
Berisha also pledged that during its next term, his government will enable Albanians to travel visa-free in Europe and will prepare the country to become an EU member by 2013.

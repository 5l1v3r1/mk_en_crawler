TIRANA, Albania -- After a thorough review of the case, President Alfred Moisiu will decide on the future of Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku, whose dismissal has been demanded by the Democratic Party (DP)-led parliamentary majority. 
A statement from Moisiu's office Tuesday (1 August) confirmed that he had received the report compiled by an ad hoc inquiry commission that investigated Sollaku for alleged links to organised crime. 
The panel confirmed the allegations and recommended his dismissal. 
By law, the president must appoint and sack the chief prosecutor.

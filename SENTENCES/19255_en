ZAGREB, Croatia -- Slovenia has agreed to attend a proposed quadrilateral meeting involving Croatia, Slovenia, Italy and the European Commission to discuss Croatia's controversial protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic. 
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader confirmed on Wednesday (February 27th) Slovenia's participation but said he has not yet heard from Italy. 
The two-day meeting could begin in Brussels on March 13th, coinciding with a European Council session and a meeting of the European People's Party leadership, which Sanader will attend. 
Zagreb is working to resolve the dispute with its neighbours so the issue does not derail its EU integration bid.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The current organisational structure of BiH is too complicated for accession processes, High Representative Paddy Ashdown told the Fena news agency on Thursday (10 November), adding that the most important aspect of constitutional change is political consensus.
On Wednesday, the Guardian newspaper reported that a draft BiH Constitution has been crafted over the past several months under the auspices of the US administration, with input from BiH political parties.
Reportedly, BiH would have one national parliament, one central government with full executive powers, and one president.
Entities would have considerably less authority.

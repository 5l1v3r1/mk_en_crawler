BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors filed charges Tuesday (March 2nd) against Serbian student Miladin Kovacevic for inflicting "severe bodily harm with possible deadly consequences", stemming from an assault nearly two years ago against a fellow university student in the United States.
Bryan Steinhauer, 22, of Brooklyn, New York, sustained skull fractures and a severe brain injury after a fight with Kovacevic in May 2008.
It happened in a bar near Binghamton University, in upstate New York.
Kovacevic was also accused of counterfeiting documents that allowed him to leave the United States after the incident.
Prosecutors also charged two Serbian diplomats who allegedly provided Kovacevic with travel documents after he had been barred from leaving the country.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Montenegrin parliament voted on Friday (October 19) to adopt a constitution reflecting the country's newly gained independence.
Fifty-five lawmakers voted in favour of the bill, while 22 voted against it.
According to the document, which was drafted by Montenegrin experts with support from the Council of Europe and the EU, Montenegro is a civil country in which all citizens enjoy equal rights, including within religious communities.
Friday's vote provides one of the missing elements for Montenegro's bid for membership in the EU.

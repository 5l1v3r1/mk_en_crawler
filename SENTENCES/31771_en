BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Launching a trade mission to Central Asia, Turkish ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed his support Tuesday (7 January) for Azerbaijan's position on the Nagorniy Karabakh issue.
The disputed region is claimed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan and has been the scene of several bloody clashes, provoked mostly by religious fanatics on both sides.
Upon his arrival in the Azerbaijani capital, Erdogan said Turkey would continue to back Azerbaijan in its "just position" on the future of the region.
He added that he expects relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan to progress to a whole new level.
The two countries are participating in a major oil project, the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.

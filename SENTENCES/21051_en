VIENNA, Austria -- The EU must resolve the issue of Kosovo's future status if it wants to enhance its credibility as an organisation able to "solve problems at home in Europe", Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer said in an interview published on Wednesday (January 2nd).
His will be among the first countries to recognise Kosovo's independence, Gusenbauer told the APA news agency.
"We will not sit on the first row and just watch what the others are doing," he said.
In response, Serbia's Foreign Ministry issued a "strongly worded demarche" Wednesday condemning such statements and reiterating its stance that talks on the Kosovo status issue should continue under the auspices of the UN Security Council.
Separately, Serbian President Boris Tadic reiterated that Belgrade would not send its army into Kosovo, as any military operation would only create a confrontation with the international community.

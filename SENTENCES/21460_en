ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Human rights watchdog Amnesty International urged Croatian authorities on Saturday (November 29th) to respond to threats made against the media after a local journalist received a text-messaged death threat.
"We urge the Croatian authorities to conduct a prompt, impartial and effective investigation to ensure that those responsible for such threats are brought to justice," Amnesty International said in a statement.
Prominent Croatian journalist Drago Hedl, who has reported on war crimes committed against Serb civilians in the 1990s, received the text message several days ago.
He works for the Jutarnji List newspaper.
On October 23rd, a car bomb in Zagreb killed Ivo Pukanic, co-owner and editor-in-chief of the Croatian political weekly Nacional, and his marketing director, Niko Franjic.

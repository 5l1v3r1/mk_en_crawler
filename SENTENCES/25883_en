TIRANA, Albania -- More than a third of Albanians prefer to live abroad in search of a better life, according to a poll by the Gallup Balkans Monitor, published on Wednesday (August 19th). 
The number is even higher among youth -- about 50% of them prefer to look for better living conditions abroad. 
According to the report, Albania bucks the trend because immigration figures have dropped in the region as a whole. 
Durim Hatibi, an expert with the Immigration Office at the Ministry of Labour, noted that 44% of Albanian households have one or more relatives abroad who assist them financially.

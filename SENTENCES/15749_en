SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of the six main BiH parties issued a joint statement Tuesday (23 May), reiterating that the current package of draft constitutional changes -- sealed by them in March -- represents the best possible way to strengthen state institutions in line with European standards.
The chairmen of the Bosniak Party for Democratic Action, the Social Democratic Party, the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH, the Serb Democratic Party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats and the Party for Democratic Progress met at the residence of US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney, the first such session since the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives narrowly rejected the draft constitutional amendments in April.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) called on parliament Tuesday (22 August) to adopt the new law on higher education before the beginning of the new university year. 
The BiH House of Representatives is expected to start debate on it Thursday. 
The measure is aimed at standardising diplomas in the country and bringing them into line with EU requirements.
In other news Tuesday, the BiH Foreign Ministry announced that EU member Hungary would introduce visas for BiH citizens starting on 1 September. 
Those who already have a visa for the so-called Schengen countries would not need a special one for Hungary.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The country's leaders welcomed on Tuesday (June 12th) the 35-year prison sentence handed down at The Hague to former Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic for the murder, torture and persecution of non-Serbs in Croatia.
President Stipe Mesic said the former president of the breakaway state of Srpska Krajina deserved the verdict since he was part of the wartime ethnic cleansing campaign in Croatia.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader also welcomed the sentence, citing the deadly May 1995 shelling of Zagreb.

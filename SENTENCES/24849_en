SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Special Representative to Macedonia Erwan Fouere reiterated on Thursday (July 2nd) that the government should appoint a successor to resigning Deputy Prime Minister for EU integration Ivica Bocevski as soon as possible.
Fouere said he had stressed that during a meeting with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
"We believe that it is very important to continue the process of reforms.
An empty position in such an important institution may have negative impact," he said.
Bocevski resigned on Tuesday, saying he has done all he can in the post.

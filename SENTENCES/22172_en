BELGRADE, Serbia -- Tomislav Nikolic, who left the ranks of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) because of disagreements over the party's anti-EU policy, will hold the founding session of his new party on October 21st, according to an official announcement Tuesday (September 16th).
Anyone who wants to be a founding member can request to do so in the next ten to 15 days.
The new formation will likely bear the name Forward Serbia, the same as that of Nikolic's recently formed parliamentary caucus.
Nikolic confirmed his intention to remain in opposition, though his party might support the ruling coalition in some areas, particularly those aimed at guaranteeing Serbia's territorial integrity.
The new formation already has 18 seats in parliament.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Albania's embassy in Belgrade announced on Tuesday (August 7th) that Serbian citizens will no longer need visas to enter Albania.
Previously, Serbs were allowed to visit Albania visa-free only during the summer holiday period, June to September.
This restriction was canceled a month ago, according to the embassy.
Albania now allows citizens from Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia to enter the country visa-free.

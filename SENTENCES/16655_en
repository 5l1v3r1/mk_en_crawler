ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul confirmed on Tuesday (November 7th) that authorities plan to amend controversial Article 301 of the penal code, which makes "insulting Turkishness" a criminal offence. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan first raised the issue at the weekend. 
Gul's comment came hours before the release of the European Commission's evaluation report on Turkey's progress in EU accession talks.

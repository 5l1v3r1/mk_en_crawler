SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government on Tuesday (October 31st) awarded a Russian firm, Atomstroyexport, the contract to build the long-stalled Belene nuclear power plant near the Danube.
The two 1,000-megawatt reactors will cost 3.9 billion euros.
Reuters reports Atomstroyexport will work jointly with France's Areva and Germany's Siemens.
The first unit is to open in 2013.

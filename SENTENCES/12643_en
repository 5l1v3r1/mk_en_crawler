SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A EUFOR military drill will be held near Sarajevo in the coming days, spokesman Rolf Kurth said at a news conference Tuesday (5 April). 
The deployment of 550 troops and vehicles from an Italian regiment based near Turin started earlier in the day. 
A KFOR unit will also arrive in the Bosnian capital, in what Kurth described as part of a regular exercise aimed at ensuring rapid reaction capability.
Also Tuesday, the commander of NATO HQ in BiH, Brigadier General Steven P. 
Schook, paid a visit to Banja Luka. 
He called for the completion of crucial defence reforms in the country and for the arrests of war crimes indictees Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.

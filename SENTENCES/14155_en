SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians in Macedonia, Arben Xhaferri, ruled out Muslim extremism in Macedonia, in an interview with Kosovo newspaper Koha Ditore on Saturday (13 August).
Any attempt at "dressing" the Albanian cause in the Balkans in "religious apparel" is aimed at compromising the interests of the Albanian people in the region, he said.
Xhaferri's remarks came in response to media reports last week that authorities in Tirana and Skopje were exchanging information regarding the possible presence of radical Islamic elements in Kondovo.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The country's strategy for EU integration by 2012 will be ready in January, Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic said on Wednesday (August 29th) at a forum in Igalo.
The complex document will define the dynamics of legislative harmonisation and development of institutions.
"Our ability to assume the responsibility going along with Montenegro's EU membership will be one of our most difficult tasks," Djurovic said.
After wrapping up negotiations on WTO membership, Montenegro will be offered an agreement under which it will adopt international trade rules effective on January 1st.
Djurovic described it as "the first institutional agreement between Montenegro and the EU, on the road towards the final integration".
In other news Wednesday, Predrag Boskovic of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DSP) said his party believes incumbent Filip Vujanovic has the best chance of winning the next presidential elections.
Boskovic says the DSP will insist on Vujanovic's candidacy.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko said on Thursday (January 13th) that BiH "desperately needs a vigorous, principled and effective government, and it needs it now". 
Speaking at a meeting with the country's academic community in Sarajevo, Inzko reiterated that "despite all difficulties in government formation, the October elections remain BiH's best chance for a fresh start." He urged NGOs and members of the public to continue to demand action from political leaders that will eventually lead to EU membership. 
Attending the meeting were ChargÃ© d'Affaires of the European Delegation to BiH Boris Iarochevitch and professors Muris Osmanagic, Dejan Milosevic and Vladimir Premec, representing 100 local intellectuals.

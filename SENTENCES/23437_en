SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku was released from detention Thursday (June 25th) but was not allowed to leave Bulgaria.
The leader of the Social Democrat Party was detained Tuesday by Bulgarian police at a border crossing with Macedonia, based on an international arrest warrant issued by Serbia.
Belgrade accuses him of involvement in crimes against Serb civilians during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.
After his release, Ceku told the media that his extradition, sought by Serbia, would be in no-one's interest and "would harm international relations".
Serbia, meanwhile, criticised Ceku's release.
Speaking in Moscow, where he attended a Russian-Serbian business forum, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said Bulgaria's decision "does not contribute to good relations between Bulgaria and Serbia".

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU is getting ready to launch a police mission in Kosovo, once the final status of the province is determined, according to senior diplomatic sources from the Union cited by media in Brussels and Belgrade.
Sources reported that the EU foreign ministers were expected to discuss an action plan for the future mission during a meeting Monday (10 April) in Luxembourg.
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic said in an interview published Sunday that compromise is needed in ongoing negotiations regarding Kosovo's final status.
He backed the government's position, which calls for wide autonomy just short of independence.
Tadic said that while Serbia would no longer rule Kosovo as it did in the past, Belgrade does not want ethnic Albanians to rule Serbs in the province, either.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown will announce a decision on BiH's police reform strategy within the next few days, according to his spokesman, Vedran Perisic. 
The top international envoy to BiH is choosing from three proposals presented by the BiH Police Restructuring Commission earlier this month.
In other news, the co-chairman of the BiH Defence Reform Commission, US Ambassador Raffi Gregorian, said Saturday (29 January) that he believed the country is capable of gaining entry into NATO Partnership for Peace Programme by the end of the year. 
However, he again stressed that realising this goal depends on handing over indicted war criminals -- particularly Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic -- to the UN tribunal.

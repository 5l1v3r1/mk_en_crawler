THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Monday (21 October) unsealed three indictments against former Bosnian Serb officers for their alleged roles in the 1995 Srebrenica massacres. 
Drago Nikolic, Vujadin Popovic and Ljubisa Beara are charged with indiscriminately killing Muslim prisoners and expelling women and children from their homes in the area. 
All three had senior positions in the Bosnian Serb Army and will be held responsible for their involvement in a "joint criminal enterprise" to rid the Srebrenica area of non-Serbs. 
The indictments were issued earlier this year, but were kept secret until Monday. 
The whereabouts of the three suspects are unknown. 
Carla del Ponte, the chief UN prosecutor, brought the indictments to Belgrade. 
She told reporters that authorities there were not co-operating with the tribunal and warned that court chairman Claude Jorda was in the process of sending an official complaint to the UN Security Council.

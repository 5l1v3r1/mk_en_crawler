Until 1 January 2003, only the former state-owned Romtelecom was allowed to offer fixed phone services in Romania. 
As usual for a monopoly, the tariffs were unrealistic and people wanting a fixed phone often had to wait years before it was installed. 
Now there are over 2,000 companies seeking to become Romtelecom's competitors at different levels. 
About 60 of them have actually taken all the necessary steps to become authorised, while 24 have their own networks.
At the end of June 2004, these firms procured almost 21,000 clients. 
In six months, this number more than tripled, with end-of-year reports showing 67,000 clients. 
Romtelecom, meanwhile, still had 4.3 million customers as of 31 December 2004. 
"The growth rate on the fixed phone market was, in 2004, 7.7 per cent," said Ion Smeeianu, the outgoing president of the National Authority for Regulating Communications.
In the region as a whole, the number of fixed telephony clients declined by 0.5 per cent last year. 
But there is an explanation for this contrast. 
"Romania has one of the lowest fixed telephony densities in Central and Eastern Europe," says economic analyst Nicolae Oaca.
As frail as the competition is in the Romanian market, the initial effects are already noticeable. 
Around 39 per cent of the international calls made last year used the services of the new companies -- almost double compared to 2003. 
This trend forced Romtelecom and the four mobile phone companies to significantly reduce prices. 
On average, the tariffs for international calls decreased by 44 per cent, but for some destinations and some periods the reduction was as high as 60 per cent. 
Long distance call pricing was lowered by an average of 25 per cent.
Until now, most of the newcomers targeted large companies -- many of their clients are medium-sized and large firms. 
But this year, the focus seems to be on smaller clients: little companies and private homes.
Mihaela Vasiluta, a representative of another fixed phone company, Atlas Telecom, said that the firm is making a 100m euro investment, with the goal of reaching one million customers. 
"For 2005, we target ten major cities, which will be followed in 2006 by another ten," she said.

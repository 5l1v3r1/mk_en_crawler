PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Governance in Kosovo should improve further, International Civilian Office head Pieter Feith said on Wednesday (October 7th). 
He added that the EU is especially concerned, after a local judge distanced himself from a sentence handed down jointly with EULEX judges late last week, against three former Kosovo Liberation Army members found guilty of war crimes committed in 1998 and 1999.
Speaking from his other position -- that of EU special representative -- Feith said he believes that the November 15th municipal elections will be free and democratic.

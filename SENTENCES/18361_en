BUCHAREST, Romania -- Justice Minister Monica Macovei's job may depend on the Constitutional Court, following passage of a no-confidence motion against her earlier this week.
On Wednesday (February 14th), the main opposition Social Democratic Party issued a statement saying the Court should decide whether Macovei should be dismissed, since she refuses to resign.

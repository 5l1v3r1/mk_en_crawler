SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative to BiH Christian Schwarz-Schilling expressed opposition Thursday (3 August) to a request by Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic to publish the names of 892 individuals linked to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
The top international envoy said the BiH criminal code did not provide for publishing the names of people under investigation and that the only legitimate and effective response to crime was to pursue perpetrators under the law. 
Tihic says releasing the list would help clear the state administration, police and security agencies of such individuals.
In other news Thursday, Bosnian Serb leaders denounced a recent proposal by Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to hold an international conference on BiH. 
He wants to discuss the country's future administrative and political system, in light of plans to close the Office of the High Representative. 
In separate statements, the BiH presidency's Serb member, Borislav Paravac, and Republika Srpska President Dragan Cavic accused Sanader of trying to meddle in domestic affairs.

BRUSSELS, Belgium - EU foreign ministers urged Bulgaria and Romania on Monday (September 13th) to take urgent action against crime and corruption, and to strengthen judicial transparency and accountability.
At a meeting in Brussels, the bloc's top diplomats praised Bulgaria's recent drive to beef up penal reforms and indictments in cases involving high-level corruption and organised crime.
At the same time, however, they warned of "important deficiencies" in court procedures and inadequate criminal cases on the heels of police work.
As for Romania, the EU foreign ministers said new legal codes due to take effect in October 2011 "will provide an important opportunity for a thorough reform of the Romanian judicial system".
On the other hand, Bucharest was criticised for making "little effective progress ...
as regards the efficiency of the judiciary process, consistency of jurisprudence and the accountability of the judiciary".

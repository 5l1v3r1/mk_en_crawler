WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF announced on Tuesday (July 15th) that it will consider Kosovo's membership bid "in due course", in effect recognising the independence of the former Serbian province. 
Kosovo announced it wants to join the IMF and the World Bank five days ago, when Prime Minister Hashim Thaci expressed hope the country's bid would win quick approval. 
Only independent countries have the right to become members.
In other news Tuesday, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu met with new UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier in Pristina to go over guidelines for official trips Zannier makes to Serbia. 
"No topic or substance that is out of line with what Kosovo authorities have been notified of or agreed to will be accepted. 
The role of a facilitator in our relations as two sovereign states is very important," Sejdiu said.

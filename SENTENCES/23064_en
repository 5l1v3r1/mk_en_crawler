SKOPJE, Macedonia -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy is urging Macedonia to intensify efforts to resolve its long-standing name dispute with Greece. 
According to media reports Wednesday (July 2nd), he sent a letter to his Macedonian counterpart, Branko Crvenkovski, assuring him that France supports Macedonia's bid to join NATO as soon as the country fulfils all the necessary criteria. 
He added the name issue should stop being an obstacle to Macedonia's NATO and EU integration. 
Greece, supported by France, vetoed Macedonia's bid for NATO membership in April over the name dispute.

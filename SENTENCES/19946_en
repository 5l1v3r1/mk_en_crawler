SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU will not accept attempts by BiH politicians to dictate the rules of integration, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in an interview with the Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz on Wednesday (March 19th). 
Rehn stressed that the public deserves full membership in the EU, not some special status relationship. 
He reiterated that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement could be sealed next month provided certain conditions are met, that is, police reform measures are approved by parliament. 
Under a new aid package for the Western Balkans, BiH would be entitled to receive a total of 440.1m euros in EU reform assistance during the next four to five years.

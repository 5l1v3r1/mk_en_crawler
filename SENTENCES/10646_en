SINGAPORE -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern told participants at a business meeting in Singapore Monday (11 October) that Turkey should become a member of the EU.
He also praised his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as a reformer.
In other news, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer signed the new Penal Code into law Monday, removing what was widely seen as the last remaining obstacle to the launch of accession talks with the EU in early 2005.
However, the government also plans to ask the EU to clarify some texts in the European Commission's latest report on the country, particularly the "open-ended" nature of future accession negotiations.
Meanwhile, hundreds of Turkish Jews gathered in Istanbul on Monday for the reopening of the largest synagogue in the country.
It was attacked by Islamic terrorists nearly a year ago.

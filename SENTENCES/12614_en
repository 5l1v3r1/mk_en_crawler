BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The commander of NATO's HQ in BiH, US Brigadier General Steven P. Schook, reportedly has suggested that a decision on abolishing the entity defence ministries by autumn could be made under the larger framework of reforming the BiH defence system.
According to media reports Saturday (8 January), Schook noted that such an option has been discussed within the BiH Defence Reform Commission.
He added that he did not believe it would lead to destabilisation.
On Friday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said that he would proceed with his plan to suspend Republika Srpska's (RS) defence and interior ministries in the autumn and transfer their responsibilities to state-level ministries.
He stressed however that this transfer would not mean abolition of the RS Army.
In other news Friday, Representatives of NATO HQ in BiH announced the handover of Bosnian Serb Dusan Bata Tesic to the Bijeljina police.
Tesic was detained on 24 December, suspected of aiding war crimes indictees.

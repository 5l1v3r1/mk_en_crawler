SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Hundreds of former soldiers of the Croatian Defence Council blocked three border crossings with Croatia on Thursday (18 December), demanding that the Federation of BiH (FBiH) government finally resolve their status and financial problems.
The ex-soldiers, who oppose the decision to cease payment of their wartime pensions, threatened to continue rallying if negotiations with FBiH authorities do not lead to a compromise.

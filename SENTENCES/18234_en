BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Representatives of Montenegro and the European Commission (EC) signed a bilateral agreement Wednesday (April 11th) in Brussels on visa relaxation and readmission, which is viewed as an important step towards full liberalisation of the visa regime with the EU.
It will likely take effect at the end of the year.
Serbia completed separate talks with the EC on a similar draft accord Wednesday, but the signing was put off until some remaining issues are resolved.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Bulgaria and Romania face possible sanctions, including the freezing of EU funding, due to the slow pace of anti-corruption efforts, Drago Koss, chairman of a Council of Europe group focused on curbing corruption, said in Bucharest on Thursday (May 22nd).
"This may have very serious consequences for the country," Koss said.
"It is true that some issues related to corruption have been resolved but concrete results are necessary, particularly regarding ministers under investigation."
Meanwhile, former Bulgarian Interior Minister Rumen Petkov gave up his immunity as a member of parliament Thursday to allow the prosecutor's office to charge him with inadvertently revealing the identity of an undercover security agent.
He resigned from the cabinet last month, but remained in parliament.

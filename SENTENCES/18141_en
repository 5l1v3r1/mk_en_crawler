PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko told B92 on Sunday (July 15th) that although everyone supports "Plan A" -- the adoption of a Kosovo resolution at the UN Security Council -- the international community has come up with a "Plan B", should Kosovo unilaterally announce independence. 
He did not elaborate, but warned of rising tension among Kosovo Albanians impatient with the process.
At its session Friday, the Kosovo government denied speculation that dividing the province might resolve issues. 
Government spokesman Bedri Gashi ruled out any changes to Kosovo's territorial boundaries.

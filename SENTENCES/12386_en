SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (11 May) to ratify the country's accession treaty with the EU.
All but three of the 234 deputies present voted for the treaty.
The result was expected, as all main political parties back Union membership, which is scheduled for 1 January 2007.
On Tuesday meanwhile, the government opened a tender for construction of a new nuclear power plant in Belene, on the Danube.
Energy Minister Miroslav Sevlievski described the 2.5m-euro project as the biggest investment in Bulgaria in the last 15 years.

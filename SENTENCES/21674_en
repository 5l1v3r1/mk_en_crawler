WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. Bush signed the protocols Friday (October 24th) on ratification of Albania and Croatia's NATO accession agreements.
At the initialling ceremony in Washington, which was attended by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Bush described the accession of the two countries as a historic step for the Balkans.
"In only one decade, the Balkans has turned from a war-torn region into a region that contributes to international peace and stability," Bush said.
He also expressed support for the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of other countries in the Western Balkans -- Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia -- and reiterated US support Macedonia's integration.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is considering a project to dig a canal connecting the Black and Marmara Seas, which would serve as an alternative to the Bosphorus Strait, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Wednesday (April 27th).
Erdogan said the aim would be to reduce transit ship traffic through the Bosphorus to zero.
Feasibility studies are expected to take at least two years.

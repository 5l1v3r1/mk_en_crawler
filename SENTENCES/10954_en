STRASBOURG, France -- The head of the Macedonian parliamentary delegation within the Council of Europe (CoE) Parliamentary Assembly, Eleonora Petrova-Mitevska, submitted a draft recommendation Thursday (28 April), calling for use of Macedonia's constitutional name in the CoE.
A total of 30 deputies from 18 states signed the document, Petrova-Mitevska said, adding that she believed chances for its adoption were good.
Greece, for historical reasons, does not recognise its neighbour's use of the name.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliament's House of Representatives (HoR) held a special session Tuesday (4 March) focusing on security problems in the country, and concluded the situation is unsatisfactory.
Members decided to make security a priority, demanding that the government offer draft measures on the subject and submit them to the HoR within 30 days.
Also Tuesday, Republika Srpska's Parliament discussed problems related to the security of non-Serb returnees, strongly condemning recent attacks on them.
The assembly said, however, that Serbs returning to the Federation of BiH face security risks as well.

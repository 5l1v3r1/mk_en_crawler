ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader won re-election Saturday (April 26th) as chairman of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union for the fourth time in a row. 
Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor won re-election too, as party vice chairman. 
Under Sanader, Croatia began accession negotiations with the EU and just this month received an invitation to NATO membership.

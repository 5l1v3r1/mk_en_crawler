PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen reaffirmed Wednesday (5 January) that talks on Kosovo's status were expected to open in 2005, but expressed scepticism that they would be completed by year's end. 
Speaking to reporters in Pristina, Jessen-Petersen said it was still too early to discuss deadlines. 
He stressed that the main task in the first half of this year would be the implementation of internationally set standards for Kosovo.
In other news Wednesday, Kosovo government spokesman Arben Qirezi denied a report that Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has received an indictment from the UN war crimes tribunal. 
The allegation appeared in the Montenegrin daily Dan.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari has launched the first phase of negotiations on Kosovo's final status, wrapping up two days of meetings Tuesday (22 November) with ethnic Albanian leaders and Serb Orthodox Church representatives.
Afterwards, President Ibrahim Rugova said he had presented the Kosovo authorities' plan for independence.
Church officials told Ahtisaari that measures must be adopted to protect Christian shrines in the province.
On Wednesday, the former Finnish president was due to travel to Belgrade for talks with Serbian officials.
There are reports of preparations for a direct meeting between representatives of the two sides in Vienna early next year.

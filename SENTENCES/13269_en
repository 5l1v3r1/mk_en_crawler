LONDON, Great Britain -- Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Thursday (27 October) that the cabinet will try to push forward a constitutional amendment under which the deployment of troops abroad would not be subject to approval by parliament. 
Sanader noted that in NATO member states, the cabinet determines deployments except in cases where large numbers of troops are needed. 
Sanader's remarks came during an informal meeting of 25 EU member states and candidate countries.

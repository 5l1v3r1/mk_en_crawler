ATHENS, Greece -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan begins a two-day historic visit to Greece on Friday (May 14th), which has the potential to yield a fresh start in EU-Turkey negotiations. 
On Thursday, he said he plans to back a deal on mutual weapons reductions. 
"Both countries have very large defence budgets. 
... 
We must reduce these expenditures and use the money for other purposes," Erdogan said in an interview with Greek national television. 
Political and regional issues, including Cyprus, are expected to top the agenda during Erdogan's meetings with Greek counterpart George Papandreou and other senior officials.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The public prosecutor's office decided on Monday (January 26th) not to pursue those who organised an internet petition demanding an apology for the killing of 1.5 million Armenian civilians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1917, which Armenia insists was genocide. 
Earlier this month, the prosecutor's office began investigating after six Turkish prosecutors submitted a petition demanding the prosecution of the organisers for "insulting the Turkish nation" under Article 301 of the Penal Code. 
Monday's ruling stated there are no legal grounds to prosecute the organisers.
In other news Monday, a court in Greece sentenced a Turkish fighter pilot to four years in prison over a fatal jet crash in 2006. 
In the incident, Turkish and Greek F-16's collided over the Aegean Sea, killing Greek pilot Costas Iliakis. 
The court convicted the pilot of the Turkish jet, Lieutenant Halil Ibrahim Ozdemir, in absentia of negligent manslaughter.

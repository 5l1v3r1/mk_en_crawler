LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- President Danilo Turk said on Tuesday (November 24th) that the Dutch government is not the only one that opposes ratification of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
According to Turk, many EU members share this opinion. 
He said a possible unfreezing of the interim trade agreement that is part of the SAA is far from certain and will be decided only when UN tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz presents his assessment of Belgrade's co-operation. 
The UN Security Council will review Brammertz's report on December 3rd. 
The EU will discuss the possible unfreezing of the SAA or interim trade accord at its summit in mid-December.

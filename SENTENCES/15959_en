ANKARA, Turkey -- US Ambassador to Ankara Ross Wilson said Tuesday (18 July) that Washington does not favour a unilateral cross-border operation by Turkey in Iraq.
He said the United States would continue to support efforts to halt Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorism via bilateral discussions with the Iraqi and Turkish authorities.
Wilson's comments came a day after media reports said the Turkish government has ordered the army to plan for cross-border action against Kurdish militants, said by Ankara to be using northern Iraq as a staging ground.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists his country is prepared to take any measures to defend its security and stability.

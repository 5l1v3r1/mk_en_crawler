BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government has invited the Federation of BiH government and the BiH Council of Ministers to resume talks on police reform, government spokesperson Cvijeta Kovacevic announced Thursday (7 July). 
Weeks ago, the RS Parliament rejected a reform based on the EU's three conditions -- state level police, organisation of police units on regional and technical principles rather than on political ones, and the suspension of political interference. 
An overhaul of the police system is a precondition for the start of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

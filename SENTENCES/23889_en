THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Lawyers for war crimes convicts Mile Mrksic and Veselin Sljivancanin are appealing the sentences handed down more than a year ago, with a former Hague president, Judge Theodor Meron, ruling on the appeals, according to a statement issued by The Hague on Wednesday (January 21st). 
Mrksic and Sljivancanin received sentences for crimes committed against Croatian prisoners of war at the Ovcara farm near Vukovar in November 1991. 
In September 2007, Mrksic received a sentence of 20 years in prison, while Sljivancanin got five years. 
Their co-defendant, Miroslav Radic, won acquittal.

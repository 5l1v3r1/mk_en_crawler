BUCHAREST, Romania -- The procedure to appoint the new chiefs of Romania's security agencies moved forward Monday (25 September) when President Traian Basescu okayed the nominations of George Maior as head of the Romanian Intelligence Service and Claudiu Saftoiu as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service.
As required by law, the president submitted the two candidacies to the speakers of the two parliament chambers for consideration.
The security agency reshuffles followed the escape of a Syrian-born businessman with suspected links to terror networks.
In other news Monday, Justice Minister Monica Macovei proposed Laura Codruta Kovesi as Romania's new general prosecutor.
The nomination moves next to the Superior Council of Magistrates.

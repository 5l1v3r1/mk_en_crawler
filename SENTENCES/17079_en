TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), is under pressure to make changes in the government from two of his coalition allies, who warned on Wednesday (November 1st) that the ruling coalition is in crisis.
Leonard Solis of the Union for Human Rights Party and Nard Ndoka of the Christian Democratic Party issued separate statements suggesting cabinet shuffles must occur to reflect the representation of parties in parliament.
Berisha has made no public comment.
But DP lawmaker Prec Zogaj suggested on Wednesday (November 1st) that no cabinet shuffle could be expected until after the winter local elections.

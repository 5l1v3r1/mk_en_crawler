ATHENS, Greece -- The EU has threatened to take Greece to court over the quality of its drinking water, claiming more than 18,000 people are being exposed to toxins.
It said the Greek Health Ministry and an unnamed international institution conducted tests that found dangerous substances in water supplied to 18 municipalities, mostly in the northern province of Macedonia.
According to media reports, Greek authorities have been aware of the issue since 1999.

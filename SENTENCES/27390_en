PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Fifty new houses for Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities were inaugurated on Wednesday (September 29th) in Mitrovica.
The houses were built with financing from a USAID fund worth 1.76m euros.
Mayor Avni Kastrati said that creating living spaces for members of the Roma community proves that Kosovo does not discriminate based on ethnic backgrounds.
Roma families returned to these houses from the Osterode and Cesmin Lug camps in northern Mitrovica.
According to USAID Director for Kosovo Patricia Rader, during the next phase of the project, 38 families will move from the two camps to Roma Mahala, in southern Mitrovica.

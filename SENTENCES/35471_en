SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Minister of Local Self-Government Aleksandar Gestakovski defended the controversial draft administrative division bill as parliament began discussing it Wednesday (11 February).
Gestakovski said the bill is vital to completion of the decentralisation process and would improve management of municipalities and public services.
Recent municipal referendums have demonstrated strong public opposition to the planned changes.
In other news, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski left Wednesday on an official visit to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
He and his counterparts will attempt to bolster military co-operation and exchange experiences related to preparation for NATO membership.

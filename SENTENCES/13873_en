ZAGREB, Croatia -- Participants in an OSCE-sponsored conference urged improved implementation Tuesday (18 October) of the law on the rights of national minorities, passed three years ago.
Describing the measure as an example for the rest of the region, OSCE mission chief Jorge Fuentes emphasised the importance of actually putting it into practice.
The conference included representatives of Croatia's 22 national minorities, NGOs, and government and party officials.
Also Tuesday, a new border crossing opened between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at Maljevac-Velika Kladusa.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development helped finance the project.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The IMF is urging Croatia to trim its public administration amid the global financial crisis. 
In a report published on Croatia's Central Bank web site Saturday (April 11th), the IMF said "Croatian officials should aspire to have a smaller, better paid, more dynamic and efficient public administration at all levels." IMF officials drafted the document at the end of a two-week working visit to Zagreb. 
Around 65,000 people are employed in the public administration sector, excluding municipal and regional government staff.

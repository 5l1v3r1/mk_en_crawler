LONDON, Britain -- Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Britain is prepared to contribute 80 policemen and judicial officials to the upcoming EU mission in Kosovo.
In a statement to the House of Commons on Monday (December 17th), Brown stressed that the EU "takes seriously its special responsibility for the stability and security of the Balkans".
The announcement was interpreted as another push for the supervised independence of Kosovo.
France, Germany and Italy also support such a step.
At a meeting in Brussels Friday, EU leaders agreed that the Union should play a key role in completing the Kosovo status process.
They also decided to send a large civil and police-support mission to Kosovo, although the exact timing of its deployment remains unclear.
In other news Monday, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried commented during a ceremony organised by the German Marshall Fund in Washington that he doesn't believe the Kosovo issue will be resolved in the UN Security Council.
Fried insisted a solution could be reached only through close collaboration between the United States and the EU.

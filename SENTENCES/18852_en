SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament adopted a law Tuesday (June 5th) on co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the last country in the region to do so. 
Drafted by the previous government, approval was held up for more than a year by the main ethnic Albanian parties -- the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA). 
They objected to a text referring to four cases of war crimes allegedly committed by former members of paramilitary National Liberation Army, which were not processed by The Hague tribunal. 
Both DUI and DPA voted against the law Tuesday.

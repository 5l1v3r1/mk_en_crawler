BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The Montenegrin and Serbian sides drafting the constitutional charter of the future Yugoslav federation reached an agreement Thursday (21 November) on the controversial issue of electing members of parliament. 
Commission members agreed to elect the members of the constituent assembly by commissions from each of the two republics. 
The assembly would have two years to come up with a constitution for the new state. 
Direct elections would then take place to elect the members of the legislature. 
For months, squabbles over the method and timing of elections have blocked the process of setting up the federation.

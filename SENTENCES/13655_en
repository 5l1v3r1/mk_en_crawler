THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors plan to try to combine the trials of three Croatian Army generals -- Ivan Cermak, Mladen Markac and Ante Gotovina -- by the end of this month.
At a news conference Friday (20 January), prosecutor Alex Whiting said the joint indictment would probably contain certain adjustments to the amended indictment against Cermak and Markac issued by prosecutors last December.
They were accused of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war in relation to their individual and command responsibility for the persecution, murders and deportations of Krajina Serbs during the Croatian military's Operation Storm in 1995.
The amended indictment against General Ante Gotovina, issued in 24 February 2004, charged him with six counts of violations of international humanitarian law committed in the Krajina region during the same period.

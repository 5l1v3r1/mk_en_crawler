Macedonia's most celebrated director, Milcho Manchevski, has started work on his third feature film, "Bones". 
The first scene was shot on 17 June at a former factory, Hemteks. 
It will be the Manchevski's first feature film to be shot completely in Macedonia, though Italy, Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are partners.
"Two things are important," the director says. 
"Firstly, to make a good film that will bring warmth to viewers' hearts, and secondly, to shoot it under standards that will earn it the description of a genuine European film."
The film, backed by the culture ministry and Euroimage, is an urban love story about a young doctor who returns to the past after a car accident.
Shooting is expected to be completed by the end of the summer, and the editing should finish by April of next year. 
Its fate will then depend on distributors. 
One, Bavaria Film International in Germany, has already entered the game as a potential distributor.
The cast includes 70 people, and the film is being shot at 80 locations. 
These are mostly in Skopje, although others include Stip, Ohrid, Demir Kapija and Bistra Mountain.
Director of photography Fabio Cianchetti is one of the most renowned cameramen in Italy. 
Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, famous for his work with director Krzysztof Kieslowski, is in charge of the score. 
Eugene Gearity, who took part in "The Aviator", appears as the audio technician.
Manchevski rose to fame with "Before the Rain", which won the Golden Lion at the 1998 Venice Film Festival. 
A subsequent film, "Dust" featured an international cast.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnia's Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said Saturday (August 4th) that he would demand changes in BiH's Council of Ministers in September if an analysis shows the performance of ministers has been unsatisfactory. 
"After the annual holidays, I will analyse the performance of each minister and the Council of Ministers as a whole," Spiric said. 
Whether or not the Council's composition could be improved is a question that needs to be answered, he added.

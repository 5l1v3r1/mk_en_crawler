BERLIN, Germany -- Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer warned on Tuesday (12 October) that Serbia must co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal if it wants closer ties with the EU.
After meeting with his counterpart from Serbia-Montenegro, Vuk Draskovic, Fischer said co-operation remains the main obstacle to closer ties and eventual membership for several countries of the former Yugoslavia.
In other news, UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte has reportedly criticised Kosovo's institutions for non-co-operation.
On Tuesday, the Pristina-based newspaper Koha Ditore quoted del Ponte as saying she faces enormous problems in the investigation of former Kosovo Liberation Army leaders.

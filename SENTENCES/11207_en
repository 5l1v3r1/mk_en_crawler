BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission has drafted a roadmap for the upcoming accession talks with Turkey, a spokeswoman for the EU announced Friday (24 June).
She described the document as a "technical framework that lays down procedures for the accession negotiations." The European Commission is expected to formally adopt the draft on Wednesday and then ask all 25 member states to approve it before it can be implemented.
Talks are due to begin on 3 October.
In other news, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener and Economy Minister Ali Babacan called on parliament Friday to endorse the social security and banking bills before the legislature goes into summer recess on 1 July.
Parliamentary adoption of the two drafts is a prerequisite for completion of the first review of Turkey's $10 billion stand-by arrangement with IMF and the release of the first IMF tranche.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro's Parliament on Friday (21 October) elected the former head of the Belgrade Military Medical Academy, retired General Zoran Stankovic, as the new federal defence minister. 
He succeeds Prvoslav Davinic, who stepped down because of an army procurement scandal. 
There has been much speculation in Belgrade that Stankovic, a former close friend of fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic, has been tasked with arranging the latter's surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal.
At their Friday session, MPs also adopted changes in the law on the federal army, under which the compulsory military service term was reduced from nine to six months.

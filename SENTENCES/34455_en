BAGHDAD, Iraq -- A suicide bomber exploded a car outside the Turkish Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday (14 October) killing himself and injuring six other people.
The incident took place just days after Turkey decided to send troops to help stabilise Iraq.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the blast was unrelated to that decision, and said it underscores the need to step up the fight against international terrorism.
The foreign ministry in Ankara issued a statement condemning the attack and urging the international community to unite in addressing Iraq's security problems.
The US State Department also denounced the bombing.
In other news, separate explosions damaged the headquarters of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party in Istanbul on Tuesday, and its offices in Izmir.
No casualties were reported in either blast.

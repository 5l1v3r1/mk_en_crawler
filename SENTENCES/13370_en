ATHENS, Greece -- Turkey has postponed signing a treaty establishing an energy community in Southeast Europe. 
Energy ministers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia-Montenegro inked the document on Tuesday (25 October) in a move intended to bring the region's energy market into line with that of the rest of Europe. 
However, EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs told reporters that Turkey needs additional "clarifications" of the treaty, particularly with regard to its environmental aspects.
The World Bank says the creation of the new energy community could attract as much as 21 billion euros in investments over the next 15 years. 
The document also is viewed as a milestone in reconciliation efforts in the former Yugoslavia.

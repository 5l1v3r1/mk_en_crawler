PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament passed a declaration Thursday (July 9th) condemning the crimes Serbian forces committed against Bosniak civilians in Srebrenica, as well as "all other crimes committed during the conflicts from 1991 to 2001 on the territory of the former Yugoslavia".
Members of the ruling coalition and representatives of the opposition Movement for Change supported the document, while representatives of the Socialist People's Party abstained from voting.
The New Serbian Democracy party voted against the declaration.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina meanwhile, organisers plan a memorial service Saturday to mark the 14th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.
On Thursday, the remains of 534 victims were sent to the Potocari Memorial Park for burial during the service.
The International Commission on Missing Persons says that so far, 6,186 of the estimated 8,000 victims have been identified, using DNA analysis.

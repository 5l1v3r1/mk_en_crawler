SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court's war crimes chamber Friday (7 April) sentenced Nedjo Samardzic, a Bosnian Serb convicted of crimes against Muslim civilians at Foca in 1992-1993, to 13.4 years in prison.
It was the court's first verdict since beginning operations a year ago.
Samardzic, 38, was found guilty of crimes against humanity including persecution, rape and torture.
Also on Friday, the director of police of Republika Srpska resigned after Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte sent a letter to his government complaining that he was not co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Dragomir Andan, 55, took the post in March 2005.
Media in the Muslim-Croat entity had accused him of committing war crimes.
He was also reported to have been close to Ratko Mladic.
Andan has denied the allegations.

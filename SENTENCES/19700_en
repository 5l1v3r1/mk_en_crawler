BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albanian President Bamir Topi met on Wednesday (November 21st) with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to discuss the Kosovo status issue, the current political climate in Albania, and reforms necessary to join the EU.
Solana said he hopes Albania joins as soon as possible, stressing that integration is in the hands of the politicians who know they must start implementing necessary reforms.
As for the Kosovo issue, both Topi and Solana agreed that an immediate solution is necessary, as the mandate of the international troika working to mediate the matter ends soon.

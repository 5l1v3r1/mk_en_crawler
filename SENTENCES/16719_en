SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Implementing police reforms is one of the key conditions for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), according to the European Commission's spokesman in BiH, Frane Maroevic.
Failure to implement reforms based on EU principles could lead to delays in signing the SAA, Maroevic said in remarks, which were quoted in the Friday (7 April) edition of Nezavisne Novine.
The EU is demanding that police be free of political interference, with policing areas based on professional and technical criteria, and with exclusive state-level competence over police.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Montenegrin naval officer Ilija Brcic, who was arrested last week in Italy based on an Interpol arrest warrant, refused in an Italian court on Wednesday (November 14th) to be deported to Croatia. 
Brcic, who faces a 15-year prison sentence for war crimes that Zagreb issued in abstentia, said he "has never been informed of any trial" against him in Croatia. 
He said he came to Italy on business and as a Montenegrin citizen, has had contacts with Croatian officials, who never mentioned any trial.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The first political party uniting ethnic Montenegrins living in Serbia was registered by the ministry of state administration on Sunday (March 23rd) under the name Montenegrin Party (CP). 
"The CP was not created for one-time use, its goal is to become a respected minority party in Serbia," said leader Nenad Stevovic. 
He did not say whether the party plans to participate in May 11th parliamentary elections.

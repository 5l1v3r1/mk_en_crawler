THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic appeared before the international tribunal Tuesday (28 January) to plead not guilty to 15 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
He was accused of orchestrating the murders of hundreds of Croats and Muslims, including women and children. 
Martic had previously been charged with ordering the dropping of cluster bombs on Zagreb in 1991 and for other crimes against the non-Serb population of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
He surrendered to the tribunal last year. 
Also Tuesday, the Croatian government issued its own indictments against Martic and his military commander Milan Celeketic for the bombings of Zagreb, Karlovac and Jastrebarsko.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Leaders of five countries -- Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria -- gathered in Ankara on Monday (July 13th) and signed the agreement to build one of Europe's key energy projects, the Nabucco pipeline.
It will connect the Caspian region, the Middle East and Egypt via Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, with gas markets in Central and Western Europe.
The project will bypass Russia in a bid to reduce the EU's energy dependence on Russian gas.
Construction of the 3,300km-pipeline is scheduled to start in 2011, with the first gas deliveries expected in 2014.
The project's cost is estimated at 7.9 billion euros.
The Nabucco project is also crucial to Turkish-EU ties, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said at the ceremony.
"This agreement could -- in the months and years to come -- open the door to a new era in the relationship between the EU and Turkey," he noted.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said such participation in European energy projects shows his country belongs to Europe, and could offer a major contribution to EU stability as a full member.

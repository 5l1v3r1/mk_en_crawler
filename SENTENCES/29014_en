SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government is preparing teams that would immediately start accession talks with the EU once the name dispute with Greece is resolved, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Saturday (August 7th).
He said 850 public administration employees are currently learning from Croatia and Slovenia's experience in negotiations with the bloc.
Gruevski did not rule out the possibility of hiring foreign consultants if needed.

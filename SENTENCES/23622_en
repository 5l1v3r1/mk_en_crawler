PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR troops have not received official information when the Spanish military contingent will leave Kosovo, KFOR spokesman Adriano Graziani said on Saturday (March 21st). 
Last week, Spanish Defence Minister Carmen Chacon announced Spain would withdraw its troops, though she did not set a firm date. 
Spain has not recognised Kosovo's independence.
Kosovo authorities expressed their gratitude and said they respected Spain's decision. 
Washington, however, is "deeply disappointed with Spain's decision", State Department spokesman Robert Wood said on Saturday. 
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer described the decision as "one-sided and premature".
In other news, police arrested a Kosovo Albanian carrying a home-made bomb in the northern part of Mitrovica late on Saturday. 
Police Chief Milija Milosevic said the man acted suspiciously, prompting police to stop and search him. 
As their investigation continues, police have strengthened their presence in the district.

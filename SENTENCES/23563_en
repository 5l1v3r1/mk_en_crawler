SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj predicted on Friday (April 24th) that BiH may wrap up its EU accession talks in 2015,despite its various problems both within BiH and the EU. 
"BiH will need at least four years to become a member," he said. 
Several EU member states, including France and Germany, warn that the bloc may freeze any further enlargement until members ratify the Lisbon Treaty. 
Alkalaj also suggested NATO accession for BiH may become a reality in 2011.

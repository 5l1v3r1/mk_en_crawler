NEW YORK, United States -- Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis said on Sunday (18 September) that Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis' postponed visit to Turkey has been rescheduled. 
The trip to Ankara was initially planned for August, but was postponed amid increasing controversy around Turkey's refusal to formally recognise the Greek Cypriot state. 
Molyviatis' statement came after talks with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul in New York.
In other news Sunday, a three-day international military air show ended at the Tanagra base, north of Athens. 
It included aerial exercises and acrobatic displays performed by military planes and personnel from 19 countries.

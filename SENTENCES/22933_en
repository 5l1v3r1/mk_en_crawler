NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are discussing whether to open a new crossing point between the Turkish north and the Greek south of the island. 
It would be established in the northwest village of Limnitis, Christofias' undersecretary, Titos Christofides, said on Monday (August 4th). 
In a month, Christofias and Talat start direct talks on reuniting the island, divided for decades.

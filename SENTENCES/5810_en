The number of people forced to flee their homes rose to a 15-year high by the end of 2010, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Monday (June 20th).
Last year, there were 43.7 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, up from 43.3 million in 2009, it noted in its 2010 Global Trends report, which does not reflect the changes stemming from developments in North Africa in the first months of this year.
Of these, 27.5 million were internally displaced persons (IDPs), 15.4 million were refugees and 837,500 were asylum-seekers.
Another key finding of the report was that 80% of the world's refugees are being hosted by developing nations, with the largest numbers found in Pakistan, Iran and Syria.
Together, the three countries account for over a quarter of all refugees, according to the UN.
"Fears about supposed floods of refugees in industrialised countries are being vastly overblown or mistakenly conflated with issues of migration," UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres pointed out.
"Meanwhile, it's poorer countries that are left having to pick up the burden."
In Europe, which has seen an influx of thousands of migrants seeking to escape the upheaval in North Africa in recent months, the number of refugees fell by 2.5% year-on-year to 1.6 million at the end of 2010.
Nearly 3 million people were forced to flee their homes during the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.
Of them, three-quarters have returned home, or "found other durable solutions", the UNHCR says in its pages on Croatia.
Serbia is the country with the largest total population of concern to the UN body, not only among the former Yugoslav republics, but within the wider region of Southeast Europe, with nearly 313,000 people.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) follows with close to 179,500.
Greece came next with about 57,430 people, 97% of them asylum seekers.
Of the more than 73,600 refugees living in Serbia, over 21,000 are Bosnians and nearly 52,500 are Croatians, UNHCR statistics showed.
It is also the regional leader as a country of origin of refugees, numbering close to 183,000 people at the end of 2010, according to the UNHCR report, which shows Turkey as second with nearly 146,800.
Croatia and BiH follow with about 65,860 and 62,910, respectively.
More than 15 years after the conflicts in BiH and Croatia, the EU has reportedly launched an initiative aimed at addressing the refugee problem in that part of the Balkans.
Speaking during a visit to Serbia's southern town of Prokuplje last week, the Union's envoy to Belgrade, Vincent Degert, said a joint regional body is being established with the aim of resolving the issue.
It would be expected to draft a programme, focusing mainly on refugees' property rights and pensions, within the next few months.
"We invited BiH, Montenegro, Serbia and Croatia to join in the collaboration so as to ease the problems of refugees who are unwilling to return," Degert was quoted as saying on Thursday.

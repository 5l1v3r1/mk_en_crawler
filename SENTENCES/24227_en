SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR members raided the Banja Luka home of Dusan Todic on Thursday (March 12th) in an effort to gather information about the whereabouts of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
"The operation was overall successful.
We seized seven boxes of documents," EUFOR spokesperson Pat O'Callaghan said.
Todic was an official with the army's intelligence centre, which was dismantled after the 1990s conflict.
Mladic's arrest is a key precondition for Serbia's progress towards EU membership.

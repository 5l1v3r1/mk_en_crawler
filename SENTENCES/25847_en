ZAGREB, Croatia -- Social Democrat Ivo Josipovic was sworn in Thursday (February 18th) as president at an inauguration ceremony in Zagreb's St Marc's square. 
In his speech, Josipovic vowed to work with the government to implement reforms needed for EU integration. 
He also pledged to work for economic reforms, strengthening the rule of law, promotion of minorities' rights and to fight corruption and organised crime. 
Ten presidents of Central and Southeast European countries attended the ceremony but not Serbia's Boris Tadic. 
Tadic refused to attend if Kosovo counterpart Fatmir Sejdiu was present. 
Josipovic -- a 52-year-old law professor and music composer -- won the presidential run-off in mid-January. 
Term limits prevented incumbent Stipe Mesic from running again.

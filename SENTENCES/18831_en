GREENSBORO, United States -- A federal court has found a former Bosnian Serb soldier guilty of lying about his service in the infamous Zvornik Brigade when he applied for immigrant status in the United States.
Veselin Vidacak, 32, will be sentenced in August.
He could get up to 30 years in prison.
Vidacak will be deported to Bosnia and Herzegovina after completing his term.
The Zvornik Brigade was responsible for the murder of thousands of Muslim civilians in Srebrenica.
It has been established, however, that Vidacak did not take part in the massacre, as military records showed him on sick leave at the time.

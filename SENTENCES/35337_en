ANKARA, Turkey -- German opposition Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel said Monday (16 February) that Turkey should be awarded a privileged partnership with the EU, since direct membership may cause problems.
Merkel's comment came during a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara.
Erdogan responded by saying Turkey would not accept this alternative and noted that the German government has pledged its support for full Turkish membership to the Union.
He reiterated that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria and looks forward to launching accession negotiations by the end of this year.

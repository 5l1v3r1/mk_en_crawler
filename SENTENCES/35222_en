ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday (19 June) that preparations under way for next week's NATO summit in Istanbul are aimed at projecting a positive image. 
Addressing a meeting of the Foreign Economic Relations Council, Erdogan said that if organised successfully, the forum would project an image of Turkey as a modern, stable and secure democratic state.
Also Saturday, a rare tornado hit the village of Sunlu near Ankara, killing at least three people, including a child. 
Authorities fear the death toll will rise as debris is cleared away.

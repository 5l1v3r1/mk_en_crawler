PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EULEX mission still struggles to become fully functional throughout Kosovo more than a year after its deployment in December 2008, according to media reports Thursday (March 25th).
Analysts say that the mandate of mission chief Yves de Kermabon expires in June.
This is likely to occur without achieving the basic goal of his mission -- to make EULEX functional throughout Kosovo.
EULEX points out some successes, such as its deployment in the Serb-dominated north.
Though the regional court in northern Mitrovica was open by EULEX, it is not fully functional.
Last week, Brussels sent a draft political plan describing the need for EULEX to become functional and efficient across the north, including the establishment of an "EU House" in the northern part of Mitrovica.

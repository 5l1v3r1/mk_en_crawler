BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A two-day meeting of the Peace Implementation Council's (PIC) steering board, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling and BiH top officials began in Brussels on Monday (February 26th). 
Discussions are expected to focus on the situation in BiH and the future of the Office of the High Representative (OHR). 
Spokesman Chris Bennet issued a statement saying the PIC board would likely extend Schwarz-Schilling's mandate in BiH by a year, through mid-2008. 
He explained that the lack of reforms has delayed the planned transformation of the international presence in BiH into a EU-led office, and the transfer of more powers to BiH authorities.

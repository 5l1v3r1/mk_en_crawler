TIRANA, Albania -- Police arrested five people Monday (July 21st) suspected of establishing a network for illegal immigration to Greece and other EU countries.
Authorities say the group charged 3,000 euros for every person it helped cross the Greek border.
In other news Monday, Albanian lawmakers approved an additional 164m euros in budget funding.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said the new funding shows the success of the government's reforms in customs and tax administration.
The opposition boycotted the session after accusing the ruling coalition of failing to earmark the additional funds for the sectors most in need.

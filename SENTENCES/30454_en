DIYARBAKIR, Turkey -- An Iranian cargo plane en route to Syria was ordered to land at the Diyarbakir airport in southeast Turkey on Wednesday (March 16th) on suspicions it was transporting military material. 
After a long search that revealed it was carrying food, the aircraft was allowed to take off. 
The foreign ministry denies reports the plane had been forced down by two F16 fighters.

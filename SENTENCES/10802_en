THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Friday (3 September) appointed two British lawyers to represent Slobodan Milosevic. 
Steven Kay will be lead council and Gillian Higgins co-counsel. 
The two British lawyers had served until now as "friends of the court", monitoring the proceedings to ensure a fair trial. 
The judges said in their decision that the lawyers would have the power to examine witnesses, make submissions on fact and law and seek orders from the court. 
Milosevic would also be allowed to play a central role and examine witnesses after they have been questioned by his defence. 
The former Yugoslav president will start to present his case on Tuesday.

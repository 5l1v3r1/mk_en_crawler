NEW YORK, United Nations -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says UN-sponsored talks on the unification of Cyprus achieved "considerable progress" in the past six months. 
In his latest report, published on Friday (May 21st), he said a solution to the long-standing issue is within reach. 
"Following the elections, Greek Cypriot leader Mr. 
[Demetris] Christofias and new Turkish Cypriot leader Mr. 
[Dervis] Eroglu wrote to me, affirming their commitment to continuing with the talks," Ban told the UN Security Council. 
Eroglu won the presidency in April defeating his predecessor Mehmet Ali Talat.

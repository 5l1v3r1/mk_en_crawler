ATHENS, Greece -- A cold wave has claimed lives and disrupted traffic in many parts of the Balkans this week.
Particularly hard hit were areas of Greece and Turkey, unaccustomed to long periods of sub-zero temperatures.
Authorities in Istanbul struggled to keep airports open and were forced to cancel dozens of flights Wednesday (25 January).
Ferry service across the Bosporus was also disrupted.
About 800 traffic accidents were reported in the city and another 300 in Ankara, claiming 17 lives and numerous injuries.
Meanwhile, hundreds of villages in Turkey and Greece were cut off from the rest of the world and had no running water or electricity.
Heavy snow in northern Greece trapped drivers on the main highway linking Athens and Thessaloniki, and the army had to be dispatched to bring in food and blankets.
In Bulgaria several deaths, mostly of elderly people, were reported.

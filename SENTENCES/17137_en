MOSCOW, Russia -- Officials said on Thursday (31 August) an agreement to build an oil pipeline linking Burgas in Bulgaria with Alexandroupolis in Greece is likely before the end of the year.
Negotiations between the governments of Greece, Russia and Bulgaria have dragged on for years.
The issue will top the agenda of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Athens next week.
In other news, Bulgaria announced plans to open two general consular missions in Serbia and Macedonia -- in Nis and Bitola.
Officials say in the past month, some 20,000 Macedonians have submitted requests for Bulgarian citizenship, in advance of EU accession.

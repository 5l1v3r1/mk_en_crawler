SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Rasim Ljajic, chairman of Serbia's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, says authorities have managed to reconstruct fugitive Ratko Mladic's movements between 1997-2003, and there is no doubt he was in Serbia during this period.
In a statement for the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz, published on Thursday (10 August), Ljajic says it appears Mladic was hiding in Serbia until the end of 2005, although there are gaps in intelligence information.
He said Serbian authorities are not sure Mladic is in the country now but are investigating all leads.
As for the other top war crimes indictee, Radovan Karadzic, Ljajic said there is no information to suggest he ever hid in Serbia.

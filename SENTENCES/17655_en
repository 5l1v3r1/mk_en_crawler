ANKARA Turkey--Prosecutors have formally launched an investigation into allegations that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the word "sayin" (esteemed) in a reference to Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party.
Investigators are analysing recordings of a radio interview that Erdogan gave to Australia's SBS Network during a trip to Melbourne in 2000.
According to transcripts posted on the internet, he is heard using the honorary title "Sayin Ocalan" twice.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has denied the allegations.
A number of Kurdish politicians have been given short jail terms for using the same phrase in the past.
Prosecutors say they might demand the lifting of Erdogan's immunity if warranted.

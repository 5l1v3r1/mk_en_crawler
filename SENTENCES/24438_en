ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A court charged nine more people Sunday (January 11th) with alleged ties to the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon, which is suspected of plotting a coup d'etat.
Among those charged is a former head of police special forces, Ibrahim Sahin.
Police detained another 33 suspects on Sunday in the second such operation in a week.
Early Monday, police also arrested prominent journalist Yalcin Kucuk for alleged connections to the case.
Prosecutors, however, ordered the release of ten Ergenekon suspects, including a retired general and a former head of the country's Higher Board of Education, on Sunday.
Police had rounded them up on Wednesday with 30 other alleged members of the organisation.
A total of 86 alleged Ergenekon members are currently on trial.
In other news Sunday, police seized 20kg of heroin purportedly bound for the European market.
Police found the drugs in a truck in the central province of Eskisehir and arrested two alleged traffickers.

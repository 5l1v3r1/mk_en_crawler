WARSAW, Poland -- Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose country takes over the rotating EU presidency in July, believes that Croatia will be able to wrap up talks with the EU and sign the accession treaty by the end of the year.
On Monday (May 9th), Tusk briefed Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias about his recent visits to Serbia, Croatia and Montenegro.
Croatia has so far closed 30 out of 35 chapters in the accession talks.
The two most problematic -- on judiciary and competition -- are still subject to negotiations.

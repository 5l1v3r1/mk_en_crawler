BELGRADE, Serbia -- Moscow and Washington still disagree over Kosovo, US President George W. Bush told a press roundtable on Wednesday (June 6th), citing a conversation he held with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"He's got deep concerns about Kosovo, and so do we," the US leader said.
"It's an issue that we're just going to have to continue to work with him on.
We believe we ought to move the Ahtisaari plan forward through the UN, and he's got reservations about it." Media reports say bilateral meetings held on the sidelines of the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany failed to yield progress on the issue.
On Wednesday, the US and German ambassadors to the UN, Zalmay Khalilzad and Thomas Matussek respectively, confirmed that the EU and the United States -- sponsors of a new UN draft resolution on Kosovo -- will postpone any vote by the UN Security Council until after the summit.

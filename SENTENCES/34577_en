BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities have decided to investigate Saturday's (27 September) arranged marriage of a 12-year-old girl to a 15-year-old boy. 
The girl is the daughter of the self-proclaimed "gypsy king", Florin Cioaba. 
Activists have denounced the wedding as a violation of human rights. 
EU Rapporteur on Romania Emma Nicholson has called on local authorities to free the girl and punish those responsible.

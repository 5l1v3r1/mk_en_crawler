SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Stabilisation and re-establishment of the rule of law in the whole country, including the reintegration of former crisis regions, should be the main task of Macedonia's rulers in 2003, said President Boris Trajkovski on Thursday (19 December) during his annual address to parliament.
The security situation in the country has improved considerably, but a lot of work for full implementation of the Ohrid peace accord remains to be done, Trajkovski said.
The president of the Democratic Union for Integration, Ali Ahmeti, also attended the parliamentary session.
This was Ahmeti's first public appearance since the September general elections.
Ahmeti said he wanted to show his respect to Trajkovski, and asserted that his party is ready to support fully the peace and reform process in the country.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A team of investigators is searching for the last two high profile war crimes fugitives sought by The Hague tribunal, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac told Tanjug on Sunday (August 10th). 
"The people who are charged with finding and arresting former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic are working seriously and we expect results, but I cannot say when," Sutanovac said. 
Last week, he publicly urged the two to surrender.

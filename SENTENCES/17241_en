POTSDAM, Germany -- The G8 meeting of foreign ministers in Potsdam, Germany on Wednesday (May 30th) failed to reconcile the positions of the United States and Russia concerning Kosovo's future status.
A brief statement issued after the meeting noted that differences remain and talks will continue.
A report by the Serbian state news agency Tanjug said Washington would distribute a revised draft of a new Kosovo resolution to the ambassadors of Security Council member states Thursday.
This new version reportedly addresses some criticisms of the previous draft.
Russia has been calling for the resumption of talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian authorities, while the United States and some EU allies back the settlement plan proposed by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.

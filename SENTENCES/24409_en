COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark is lifting labour restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians effective on May 1st, the Romanian Employment Agency announced on Wednesday (April 8th).
That means Bulgarians and Romanians will have the right to work in the country without the permits currently required and under equal terms with Danish citizens and citizens of other EU members.
Foreign companies that send employees to Denmark to work will have to register with the Danish Register for Foreign Service Providers.

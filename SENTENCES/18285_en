PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The government is expected to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU during Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's official visit to the capital Thursday (March 15th). 
The SAA talks began in 2005 but were suspended for several months due to Serbia's lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Talks resumed after Montenegro split from its state union with Serbia last May.
In a special statement published in the local newspaper Vijesti, Rehn congratulated the country. 
He said strengthening administrative and judicial capacities and adopting a new constitution are among the biggest challenges ahead.

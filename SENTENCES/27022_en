PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reiterated on Saturday (March 6th) that Kosovo's independence is irreversible. 
In an interview with the Beta news agency, "The territorial integrity of Kosovo is untouchable, internationally recognised and guaranteed, and Kosovo will, within these borders, integrate into NATO and the EU," Thaci said. 
The prime minister pointed out that Kosovo is ready to hold negotiations on improving relations with Serbia, but stressed it will never accept talks on its status. 
"We can talk as two independent states about concrete issues of interest for both countries," Thaci said. 
He voiced expectation that the International Court of Justice's ruling will confirm the legitimacy of Kosovo's independence.

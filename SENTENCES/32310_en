BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and Serbia's ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition failed Sunday (3 November) to reach a compromise concerning DSS's return to Parliament.
After leaving the ruling coalition, DSS lost its 45 seats in Serbia's legislature and was stripped of its mandates.
Following the weekend talks, DSS officials said a draft agreement offered by DOS was still unacceptable.
Talks are expected to continue.

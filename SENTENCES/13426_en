BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In an interview with Reuters Tuesday (28 March), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said there has been "a sea of change" in Romania over the past 14 months and the country is making real progress in combating corruption and strengthening its judiciary.
He was more cautious in describing Bulgaria, urging it to amend its constitution quickly, so that it completes judicial reforms before the target date for admission on 1 January 2007.
Rehn said both countries have a good chance of meeting their deadlines.
Also Tuesday, Finland told Bulgaria that it would ratify the EU Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania in May.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev received the assurances during meetings with senior officials in Helsinki.

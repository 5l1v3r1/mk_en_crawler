ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday (18 October) that his country might abandon plans to deploy troops in neighbouring Iraq if the provisional authorities in Baghdad maintain their opposition to the Turkish presence.
He explained that parliament's resolution in support of the deployment did not compel his cabinet to send troops.
He said it was the result of a US request, and that Turkey had been less than enthusiastic about the prospect from the beginning.
Erdogan concluded that the government would await developments associated with the new UN Security Council resolution, authorising the establishment of an international security force in Iraq.
Turkey's Red Crescent, however, is sending humanitarian supplies to families in Baghdad.

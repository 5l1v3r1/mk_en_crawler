BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic and the Deputy Commander of US EUCOM, General William Ward, sealed a bilateral Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement in Belgrade on Wednesday (November 8th).
Both praised the move as another major step in boosting bilateral military ties.
US Ambassador Michael Polt stressed that the US and NATO would like to see Serbia in the Partnership for Peace programme, but stressed that the effort depends primarily on Belgrade's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

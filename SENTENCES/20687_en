THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Wednesday (November 7th) that it ordered the questioning of eight Croatian journalists to decide whether they should be charged with contempt of court.
The suspects include three senior national television reporters as well as journalists from several of Croatia's main newspapers.
They are accused of publishing sections of the indictments against former generals Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, information that was deemed confidential at the time.
The three defendants are charged in connection with the deaths of 150 Serbs and the expulsion of 200,000 others, during a military operation in the summer of 1995.

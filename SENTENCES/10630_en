THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The two lawyers representing Slobodan Milosevic filed papers Thursday (9 September), asking for permission to appeal their appointment by the UN tribunal. 
British lawyers Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins said a lack of co-operation from the defendant could affect the outcome of the trial. 
They say Milosevic is determined to defend himself.
In other news, the UN tribunal on Thursday granted provisional release to six Bosnian Croats charged with committing atrocities against Muslims during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
They will have to return to The Hague for the start of their trials. 
The six had surrendered to the tribunal.

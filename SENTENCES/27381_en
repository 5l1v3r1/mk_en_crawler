BELGRADE, Serbia -- The IMF has given conditional consent to disbursing the next 380m-euro tranche of its 2.9 billion-euro standby loan to Serbia. 
The government must submit a pension reform package to parliament in the next two weeks, and make public administration cuts before formal approval next month, IMF mission chief Albert Jaeger said on Thursday (May 27th), after completing the required review. 
He also noted Serbia's slow economic recovery, and revised the IMF's initial forecast of 2% growth to 1.5%.

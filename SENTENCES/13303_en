BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Council officially endorsed the so-called Accession Partnership document with Croatia on Monday (20 February). 
The European Parliament approved the document last month, at the request of the European Commission. 
It sets short- and medium-term priorities on Croatia's road to full EU membership, and serves as a guideline for providing EU financial assistance to Croatia.

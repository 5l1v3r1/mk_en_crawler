BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu said Friday (25 August) that he had no reason to believe that there will be a barrier to opening the former secret services files.
However, he warned, if this results in the ruling coalition parties being forced to expel considerable numbers of parliamentarians whereby they lose a majority in parliament, then early elections might be called.
The prime minister denied that the decision to declassify secret services files was meant to deteriorate relations among government allies.
Three of the parties in the ruling coalition -- PD, PNL and UDMR -- decided to expel all their members, proving they co-operated with the former secret services agency.
The main opposition party PSD also appears determined to follow the move.

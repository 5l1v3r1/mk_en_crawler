SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The House of Representatives adopted a set of laws Wednesday (June 10th) necessary for achieving a visa liberalisation regime with the EU. 
Prime Minister Nikola Spiric briefed lawmakers on BiH's progress toward visa-free travel. 
To take effect, the new legislation needs the approval of the House of Peoples as well. 
The European Commission has set 174 conditions that BiH must implement.
In other news Wednesday, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana warned that the decision by Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament -- to stop transferring responsibilities to state-level institutions raises -- doubts about BiH's competence in several fields. 
In a report to the UN Security Council, Solana explained this means that any future power transfer -- preparing for the international community's exit from BiH -- will be very complicated. 
He also stressed that while nationalistic rhetoric is on the rise, the overall security situation seems stable.
High Representative Valentin Inzko set a June 11th deadline for the RS parliament to withdraw its controversial decision. 
He says the resolution breaches the Dayton Accord and has warned he will use his Bonn authority to scrap it.

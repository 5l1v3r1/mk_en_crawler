SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia plans to send 90 more troops to Afghanistan in June under British command, Ambassador Robert Chatterton Dickson said at the opening of the new British Embassy in Skopje on Thursday (18 May).
However, the deployment is subject to approval by parliament.
A member of NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, Macedonia participates in the peacekeeping mission in Iraq under US command, and plans to take part in the EU-led Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Also Thursday, the Bulgarian government agreed to send 70 more troops to Afghanistan to take over security arrangements at the Kabul airport for five months, starting in August.
They will join the 100-strong Bulgarian troops and medical staff already serving there.
Again, the additional deployment is subject to parliamentary approval.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic said on Friday (15 July) that Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic would soon be arrested and brought before The Hague tribunal. 
Marovic acknowledged in talks with Austrian counterpart Heinz Fischer that Belgrade cannot make progress towards membership in the EU and NATO as long as Mladic remains at large.
In other news, the son of wartime Republika Srpska (RS) leader Radovan Karadzic, Aleksander Karadzic, was released Sunday morning after a 10-day detention by NATO forces in BiH. 
He was arrested in Pale on 7 July for allegedly supporting war crimes indictees.
On Friday meanwhile, Montenegrin police arrested Radovan Karadzic's brother, Luka, after a traffic accident that left one person seriously injured. 
Officials say alcohol may have been a factor in the crash.

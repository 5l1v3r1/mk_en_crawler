TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament's latest round of voting for a president failed on Tuesday (July 10th) evening because none of the candidates managed to attract the required 84 votes.
The ruling Democratic Party's Bamir Topi got 74, compared to five for former Prime Minister Fatos Nano of the main opposition Socialist Party (SP).
As in previous rounds, the SP-led left-wing opposition coalition boycotted the proceedings, and the required quorum was not met.
Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier Solana, says the impasse could jeopardise Albania's integration bid.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- As required under its 1999 agreement with the EU, Bulgaria turned off its two oldest reactors Tuesday (31 December), leaving the Kozloduy nuclear power plant with four working reactors. 
Bulgaria is under pressure from the Union to shut down two more units in 2006 and has agreed to do so if a special EU inspection finds them unsafe. 
The government is contemplating offsetting the loss of the four reactors by completing the Belene nuclear power plant. 
Construction was halted in 1991. 
Bulgaria is a major exporter of electricity to Turkey, Kosovo, Serbia and Albania.

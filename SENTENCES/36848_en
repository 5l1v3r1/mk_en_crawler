ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's daughter was married Sunday (11 July) in a ceremony attended by Christian and Muslim leaders and described by her father as a bridge between the West and the Islamic world.
Thousands of guests attended the ceremony, including Jordan's King Abdullah II, Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.
Karamanlis' attendance was another sign of improved relations between Turkey and Greece.
"This is something I couldn't even have dreamed of a few years ago," NTV quoted Karamanlis as saying.
"This shows that we're doing something right." (AP - 11/07/04)

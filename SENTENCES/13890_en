TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha says he received assurances during separate meetings last week with his Greek and Turkish counterparts, Costas Karamanlis and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of continued support for Albania's Euro-Atlantic integration bids. 
The meetings, in New York on Thursday (15 September), reportedly resulted in the formation of a joint body led by the Albanian and Greek foreign ministers that would work to strengthen bilateral ties. 
Erdogan meanwhile reportedly vowed continued technical assistance to bring Albania's military sector in line with NATO standards.

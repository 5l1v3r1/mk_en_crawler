ANKARA, Turkey -- Wrapping up a two-day official visit to Ankara on Friday (November 17th), Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pledged that Iraqi authorities would not allow the reopening of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) offices.
He stressed that his government will not tolerate the presence of any group or institution that represents a threat to Iraq's neighbours.
Separately, Iraq's special envoy for combating PKK, Sirvan al-Vaili, declared on Saturday that the Iraqi authorities would undertake strategic measures against PKK in the coming months, aimed at the terrorist organisation's complete elimination within a year.
Steps being considered include the establishment of an intelligence network, as well as strengthened border control.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska Army kicked off a pilot project Thursday (29 July) to destroy surplus small arms and light weapons.
A total of 2,500 pieces were destroyed at the Jelsingrad factory in Banja Luka, with 500 more to follow on Monday.
The operation is in line with a decision by BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic to impose a moratorium on the sale of surplus small arms and light weapons.
OSCE spokesperson Vedrana Dimitrijevic commended the project, saying it demonstrates BiH's commitment to international efforts against weapons proliferation.
The army of the other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is to start its own programme to destroy surplus weapons within weeks.

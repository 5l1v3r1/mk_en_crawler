ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul ruled out any possibility of Turkey sending troops to neighbouring Iraq. 
"Dispatching troops is out of the question," Gul said at a press conference Thursday (8 April). 
Commenting on the recent escalation in violence in Iraq, Gul said it was a very dangerous development that marks the beginning of a new stage in the country's recent history.
Also Thursday, Turkey and Slovenia signed a memorandum of understanding on security co-operation. 
The agreement provides for co-operation in the areas of drug trafficking prevention, combating international terrorism and other organised international crimes.

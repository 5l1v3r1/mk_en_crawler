BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Kosovo's final status should not be a bargaining chip in the context of Serbia's EU bid , the bloc's security chief told the newspaper Blic on Tuesday (September 12th). 
Javier Solana sidestepped a series of questions about Kosovo, but said a permanent solution should be found through negotiations. 
"We hope ... 
that in December we shall be able to support a solution agreed upon between the two sides," Solana said. 
When asked to about the possibility of Serbia becoming an EU candidate in 2008, Solana said the only real obstacle is full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In Brussels on Tuesday, Solana met with Kosovo's key opposition leader Hashim Thaci, who is also a member of the Kosovo negotiation team. 
He talked about the importance of a united EU position on Kosovo.
In Pristina meanwhile, President Fatmir Sejdiu met with other members of the negotiating team and said they are drafting a strategy on future friendly relations with Serbia, which he said would be applied after Kosovo gains independence.

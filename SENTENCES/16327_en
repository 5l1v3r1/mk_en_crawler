PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The OSCE/ODIHR said on Thursday (10 August) that it has deployed a long-term observation mission to Montenegro that would monitor the newly independent country's first parliamentary elections on 10 September.
The mission, led by Danish diplomat Jorgen Grunnet, includes nine international observers based in Podgorica, as well as 17 deployed elsewhere around the country.
They would monitor campaigning, media coverage, and the work of local election officials.
The OSCE/ODIHR will ask the OSCE member states and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to send 150 short-term observers for Election Day.

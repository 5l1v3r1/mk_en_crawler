ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou is urging his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to re-launch efforts to improve bilateral ties, Papandreou announced Monday (January 25th). 
In response to a letter sent in November, the Greek prime minister invited Erdogan on an official visit, saying he desires to "establish more vital and more productive ties" between Ankara and Athens. 
He also urged Turkey to stop disputing Greek sovereignty in the Aegean Sea, particularly by violating Greece's air space.

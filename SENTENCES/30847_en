BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele believes that free and fair elections on Sunday (December 12th) will raise Kosovo's credibility as a democracy.
At a conference on Western Balkans EU integration, organised by Friends of Europe on Thursday, Fuele said he expects a considerable number of Kosovo Serbs to participate in the snap general elections.
Also calling on Serbs to participate is the Serbian Helsinki Committee (SHC).
Kosovo Serbs are realising that funds sent by Belgrade to support them are drying up and now it is Pristina looking out for their interests, SHC officials said at the Media Centre in Caglavica.

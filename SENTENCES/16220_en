TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) has voted to select Clirim Gjata as its new head. 
Four out of the body's seven members backed Gjata, who will take up the post that was left vacant after Ilirjan Celibashi stepped down in April. 
Opposition parties are crying foul, however, saying the CEC's legitimacy is in question because one of the newest three CEC members was appointed without opposition consent.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Justice and Home Affairs Council decided on Monday (November 30th) to abolish the visa regime for Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia as of December 19th. 
Citizens of these countries who possess valid biometric passports will be able to travel to the EU without visas -- except to Britain and Ireland -- and to stay for up to three months.
In other news Monday, Serbian President Boris Tadic is in Brussels for talks with EU officials. 
In an interview Sunday with the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti, Tadic reaffirmed that Serbia will apply for EU membership after the interim trade agreement, which is part of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, is unblocked. 
He declined to mention the exact timing, saying Serbia will submit its application only when authorities are sure it will be positively received.

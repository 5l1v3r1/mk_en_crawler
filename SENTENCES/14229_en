ZAGREB, Croatia -- A Reuters survey published Thursday (11 August) suggests a 70 per cent likelihood of Bulgaria being admitted to the EU in 2007, and a 63 per cent chance for Romania. 
The poll, conducted among 34 experts and analysts, registered a considerable decline in optimism compared to a May survey, in which 90 per cent expressed confidence in Bulgaria's 2007 accession and 80 per cent expressed confidence in Romania's scheduled membership. 
The analysts largely attributed the drop to political problems slowing down the reform process. 
They said that in terms of economic reforms, Croatia is much more advanced than either of the two candidate countries, but the government's inability to arrest Hague fugitive General Ante Gotovina remains a concern.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Representatives of students from around 20 faculties in eight cities throughout Croatia presented a letter Monday (May 4th) demanding that the government pay all tuition fees for the 2009-2010 academic year.
Students have been protesting for more than three weeks now, halting instruction at several universities.
Croatia, a country where education is still widely free, has introduced tuition fees for master's and doctorate programmes starting in the fall.
The students insist the move will prevent many of them from continuing their education.

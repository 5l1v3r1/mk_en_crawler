LONDON, United Kingdom -- A clear majority of UN Security Council members back a plan that grants independence to Kosovo, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said in an interview published on Wednesday (May 2nd).
He went on to add that he plans to meet with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov in an attempt to find common ground on the adoption of a UN resolution within the next 30 days.
Officials from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- representing the so-called Kosovo Contact Group -- are discussing the matter at the British Foreign Office late Thursday.

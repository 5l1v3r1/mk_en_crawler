ANKARA, Turkey -- A small bomb exploded on Monday evening (December 8th) outside an office of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the southeastern city of Van.
Authorities reported no injuries, said Van Governor Ozdemir Cakacak.
The blast caused property damage and broke windows of several nearby shops.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which happened on the first day of the Muslim religious holiday of Eid al-Adha.
The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) declared a nine-day unilateral cease-fire Monday to mark the holiday.
Separately Monday, the Turkish Army said five PKK militants surrendered to security forces in the southeastern provinces of Hakkari and Sirnak.
Meanwhile in Paris, the trial of 11 suspects with alleged links to a local youth group affiliated with the PKK began Monday.
The defendants allegedly committed a series of firebombings of Turkish bars and cultural sites in southwestern France last year.

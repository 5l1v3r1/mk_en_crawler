BUJANOVAC, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also chairs the national council for ties with the UN tribunal, said in Bujanovac on Monday (20 March) that he expects more pressure from the tribunal to hand over remaining indictees.
He noted that following the suicide of former Croatian Serb leader Milan Babic and the death of Slobodan Milosevic, the only remaining high-profile indictee at The Hague is Croatia's Ante Gotovina.
In other news, Beta news agency reported on Monday that a Serbian court is dropping criminal proceedings against Milosevic, stemming from the 2000 murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic.
Prosecutors had said he was abducted by members of the Red Berets secret police unit, on Milosevic's orders while jogging in a Belgrade park.

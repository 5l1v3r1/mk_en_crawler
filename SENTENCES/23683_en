NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A Cypriot court on Friday (March 20th) acquitted ten police officers accused of brutally beating two students in Nicosia in December 2005. 
An amateur video showing police punching and kicking the two handcuffed students in the street was broadcast by local television in 2006 and prompted an investigation into the case. 
However, the video evidence was deemed inadmissible. 
The ruling triggered widespread public criticism and protests outside the court. 
Attorney General Petros Clerides said the court's decision "encourages police terror" and harms public confidence in the judiciary.

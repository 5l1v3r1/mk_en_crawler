PRESEVO, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ethnic Albanian parties in the municipal councils of Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja adopted a political platform Saturday (14 January) that calls for a strong degree of political and administrative autonomy. 
It urges decentralisation, withdrawal of Serb military and police forces from the area, the launch of a multiethnic border police recruited from the local population, and establishment of special ties with Kosovo.
The Serbian government has criticised the document as a provocation in light of the Kosovo status talks. 
However, Serbia-Montenegro Human and Minority Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said Belgrade should address "realistic" demands raised in the platform, such as increased participation of the ethnic Albanians in the judicial system, police, healthcare and education.

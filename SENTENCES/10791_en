MAASTRICHT, Netherlands -- Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, the current chair of the EU Council of Ministers, said Saturday (4 September) that the EU would offer Serbia and Montenegro separate talks on trade and economic issues.
Bot stressed that the "twin track" approach would be applied only to those issues and that the EU continues its firm support for the state union of Serbia-Montenegro, which he described as being of the utmost importance to the stability of the region.
Bot's statement came at the end of a two-day meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Maastricht.
EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten and the Union's security chief, Javier Solana, are expected to visit Belgrade in October for talks on a new plan for EU integration.
In other news, the Kosovo Contact Group met in Belgrade on Friday to discuss the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the province's October parliamentary elections.
The delegation held separate talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
The issue of decentralisation was also raised.
Speaking on Saturday in Maastricht, Solana said some of the Serbian government's suggestions could be used, together with UNMIK's draft decentralisation plan for Kosovo.

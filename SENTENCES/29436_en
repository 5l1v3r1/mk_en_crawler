SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry announced on Friday (April 30th) that police had found a stash of weapons hidden underground near the Kosovo border. 
The cache, including mines, grenades, shells and three aircraft machine-guns, were discovered after other weapons were found in the same area Thursday. 
That followed a shootout between police officers and a group of unidentified gunmen at the border.
In other news Friday, police in Kosovo found a significant amount of guns and munitions in a routine check near the village of Paldenica. 
Three people were arrested, and a bunker full of uniforms, guns and other weaponry was discovered during a raid on the house of one of those arrested. 
Police are working to determine if there is any link between the two weapons stashes.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Wednesday (October 29th) that Serbia will ask the Council of Europe to persuade Albania to agree to an investigation of alleged cases of organ harvesting during the Kosovo conflict. 
Vukcevic said that since Albanian Chief Prosecutor Ina Rama rejected a request for an investigation of the allegations, the Council of Europe is the next move. 
Vukcevic also accused Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha of "ordering secret services to destroy documents and evidence on missing Serbs and trafficking of their organs".
Tirana insists local authorities have investigated the allegations, as has an investigator from The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
Initiating all this were allegations former chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte made in her book "The Hunt". 
She claimed hundreds of Serbs and Roma were murdered in Gur, Albania, for their organs.

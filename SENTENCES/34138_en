PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- About 24 Kosovo Serb families returned Monday (14 July) to the village of Belo Polje, four years after fighting drove them out.
Liljana Belos, the head of returns for Belgrade's Kosovo Co-ordination Centre, says the families have started to rebuild their homes, with assistance from the international community.
Belos said she hopes other families would follow.
In other news, the head of the Co-ordination Centre, Nebojsa Covic, met Tuesday with Bruce Jackson of the US Committee on NATO, who insisted that Kosovo remains part of Serbia-Montenegro and that European integration is its best path.
Covic, a deputy prime minister in the Serbian government, said solutions to problems in Kosovo should not be sought in the province or in Serbia-Montenegro, but in the region as a whole.
Talks between Belgrade and Pristina are expected in September.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The government will complete reforms necessary for meeting the EU's Maastricht criteria this year, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told journalists Monday (12 May).
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek spoke along the same lines, saying the reform package would be submitted to parliament as soon as possible.
One of the reforms involves the restructuring of the national Security Council, in a bid to reduce the number of military members -- a source of repeated criticism by the EU.
Meanwhile, during a two-day visit to Turkey, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi reiterated support for Ankara's EU membership.
Italy assumes the rotating EU presidency in July.

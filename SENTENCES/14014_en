SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Teachers continued their strike for the fourth day Thursday (15 December), after the three trade unions in the educational sector rejected the government's latest wage hike proposal.
The unions are demanding a 15 per cent raise.
In neighbouring Greece, parliament has begun discussing a draft law on reforms in public companies, despite an ongoing protest by trade unions in the sector.
A vote is expected Thursday.

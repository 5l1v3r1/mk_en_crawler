SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Council of Ministers adopted draft amendments to the law on the Intelligence and Security Agency on Thursday (1 December), giving the agency more power to combat terrorism. 
The agency would be empowered to arrest and interrogate individuals suspected of terrorism, while informing relevant law enforcement structures and the BiH Court in a timely manner. 
The agency would be also authorised to conduct security checks of individuals with access to confidential information.
In other news Thursday, the Office of the High Representative issued a statement indicating dissatisfaction with the pace at which Republika Srpska is implementing strategic reforms. 
The pace, said a spokeswoman, could jeopardise BiH's prospects for economic progress and eventual EU integration.

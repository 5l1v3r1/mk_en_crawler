BRUSSELS, Belgium -- At its plenary session Thursday (October 7th), the European Parliament (EP) backed a report that recommends scrapping visa requirements for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania.
The proposal was adopted by a vote of 538-47, with 41 abstentions.
The final decision to grant Albanian and Bosnian citizens visa-free travel to most EU countries is now up to the Council of Ministers, which is expected to discuss the issue in November.
On the eve of the vote, the EP rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, voiced optimism that citizens of the two countries would be able to travel in the EU without visas by the year's end.
"Albania and BiH have fulfilled all the conditions and are ready for the abolition of visas.
It is time to send a positive message to those countries:
we will tear down the visa walls, "she said during debate at the EP on Wednesday.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A hearing Tuesday (December 28th) in the so-called Sledgehammer case was postponed until January 6th amid renewed demands by defence lawyers to replace some judges in the trial.
On Monday, a court in Istanbul rejected the requests to replace three judges, who the defence argued were biased, as they ordered the arrest of almost half of the suspects in the very early stages of the investigation, based on weak evidence.
Head Sledgehammer Judge Omer Diken, who was assigned to the post just two days before the first hearing and was the main reason for the objections, says the postponement will give the 12th Istanbul Court of Serious Crimes time to rule on the objections.
The case involves a total of 196 former military officers accused of plotting to oust the government.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday (December 10th) that the European Commission (EC) intends to address visa facilitation for Kosovo, which he says may lead to visa liberalisation.
All 27 EU members, including those that have not recognised Kosovo's independence, must approve starting the process.
Equally important is the fact that Kosovo authorities must meet requirements spelled out in a set of guidelines they will receive if an agreement on this issue is reached within the EU.
At a government meeting Thursday, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said the country has already started implementing standards for the visa liberalisation process.

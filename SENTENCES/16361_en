ATHENS, Greece -- A furor has erupted over reports Tuesday (12 September) that a member of Greece's Competition Committee, Panagiotis Adamopoulos, demanded a bribe of 2.5m euros from a local dairy company, Mevgal, in exchange for reducing a 25m-euro fine.
The scheme allegedly included two other people:
customs official Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos and an Adamopoulos relative named Konstantinos Konstantinidis.
The latter was arrested last week, reportedly while accepting 200,000 euros in marked bills.
The three men now face charges of blackmail and bribery.
Adamopoulos, who has been suspended from his post, denies any wrongdoing.

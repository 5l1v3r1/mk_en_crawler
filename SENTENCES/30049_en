ATHENS, Greece -- Lawmakers from the ruling PASOK party on Friday (April 15th) proposed establishing a parliamentary inquiry committee to investigate former Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos for bribery.
He is suspected of having received kickbacks over a controversial contract to purchase four German submarines for the Greek Navy a decade ago.
Parliament is due to discuss the proposal on April 29th.

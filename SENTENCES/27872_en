TIRANA, Albania -- The Serious Crime Prosecution unit seized 1kg of cocaine coming from Latin America on Monday (November 22nd) and arrested three suspected members of an international drug trafficking network. 
Authorities say the arrests stemmed from co-operation with colleagues in the US and Italy. 
This is the 3rd seizure of cocaine coming from Latin America in a short period of time. 
Several days ago, 9kg of cocaine coming from Latin America were seized in the port of Durres.
Separately, police seized 43kg of marijuana in Tirana and arrested six members of an illegal drug distribution group.

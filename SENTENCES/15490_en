SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The US Embassy in Skopje issued a statement Friday (23 June) voicing great concern over continued incidents in Macedonia's pre-election campaign and urging all political parties to ensure that violent acts and provocations stop immediately.
Otherwise there is a risk of serious consequences for the country's NATO membership prospects, the statement said.
Similar calls have come from President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and Nikola Gruevski of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE.
On Friday, supporters for the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia and VMRO-DPMNE were involved in a shooting incident.
The following day, a gunman shot and wounded a local leader of the main ethnic Albanian Democratic Union of Integration in Tetovo.
However, the shooting was not related to the election campaign, authorities say.

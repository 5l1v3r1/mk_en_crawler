SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- After nearly two decades, Mostar has been declared again the seat of the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
Bishop Grigorije of Zahumlje and Herzegovina announced the return on Sunday (January 2nd), calling the event historical and urging Serbs to come back to the city.
He led a religious service attended by Mostar Mayor Ljubo Beslic, among others.
Beslic described the event as important not only for the church, but for the peaceful co-existence of Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks in the multicultural city.
The seat of the eparchy was temporarily transferred to Trebinje in the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict.

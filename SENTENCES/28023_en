SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) has no plans to quit the ruling coalition but believes some issues must be resolved to accelerate Macedonia's EU bid. 
That was DUI leader Ali Ahmeti's message in talks Monday (May 17th) with Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM. 
They agreed that political dialogue should be intensified and that resolving the name dispute with Greece is a top priority. 
The meeting, initiated by Crvenkovski, followed a recent comment by EU envoy to Macedonia, Erwan Fouere. 
He warned that if the cabinet fails to focus on EU-related reforms and resolve the name issue quickly, the country's EU future could be at risk.

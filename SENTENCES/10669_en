ZAGREB, Croatia -- The countries of Southeast Europe were reconnected to the Western European power grid on Sunday (10 October) in an operation co-ordinated by Croatia's HEP electricity company.
The move will allow Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia-Montenegro, as well as Ukraine, to gain direct access to the European energy market.
The link was blocked at the start of the Balkan conflicts in 1991.

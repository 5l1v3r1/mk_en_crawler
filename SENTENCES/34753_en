SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Presidential military security adviser Gen Mikho Mikhov said Tuesday (12 August) that the government will host an international conference next month titled Balkans and NATO:
United Against Terror.
The forum, to be held from 10 September to 13 September, will address the problem of international terrorism and its prevention, specifically in a Balkan context.

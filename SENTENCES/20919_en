BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia has put forward six conditions for its participation in the negotiations on the status of Kosovo, the daily Vecernje novosti reported on Saturday (August 4th). 
Belgrade says the negotiations should concern the province's status, should be direct, should not be limited by a deadline, should not be aimed at a predetermined result, should not be based on the Ahtisaari plan, and should be held under UN Security Council auspices.
Members of Serbia's delegation for the talks have reportedly also been chosen. 
They include President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic and Kosovo and Metohija Minister Slobodan Samardzic. 
For the first time, the delegation may also include representatives of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist Party of Serbia, formerly led by Slobodan Milosevic.

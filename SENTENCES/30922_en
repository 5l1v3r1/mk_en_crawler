PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo's President Behgjet Pacolli will hand over duty to Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi on Monday (April 4th). 
The Constitutional Court reiterated on Friday that Pacolli is no longer president as his February 22nd election breached the constitution due to lack of quorum in the parliament and a counter candidate.

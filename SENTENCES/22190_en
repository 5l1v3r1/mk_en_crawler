ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police announced on Monday (September 15th) the arrest of Muhamed Brkic, whom Serbia accuses of war crimes in Tuzla in 1992.
Police detained Brkic, 41, on Friday at a beach near Makarska and handed him over to the Split district court.
Brkic acknowledges he has the same name as the fugitive but says that man died three years ago.
Judge Davor Svalin had his doubts and ordered him held for 40 days.
Brkic, a former member of the so-called crisis headquarters in the Tuzla municipality, is wanted in connections with the Tuzla Column case, in which 200 members of the Yugoslav National Army died and around 140 suffered injuries.

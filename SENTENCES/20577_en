PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR Commander Roland Kather visited the area of Dukagjin on Thursday (August 9th) and described the current situation in Kosovo as calm and stable. 
He downplayed the chance of provocations coming from Serbia during the 120 days of new negotiations on Kosovo's final status.
In other news, hundreds of army reservists blocked a key road in southern Serbia for about an hour Thursday, demanding back pay they are owed for participating in the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo. 
They warn of more "radical" measures if the government ignores them.

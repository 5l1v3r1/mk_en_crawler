BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament endorsed on Wednesday (October 4th) the appointment of new chiefs of the country's two intelligence agencies -- George Cristian Maior as head of the Romanian Intelligence Service and Claudiu Saftiou as head of the Romania Foreign Intelligence Service.
President Traian Basescu nominated them last month.
The previous intelligence heads resigned in July after a scandal related to the disappearance of Syrian businessman Omar Hayssam, who was charged with terrorism.
Basescu, meanwhile, visited Yerevan on Wednesday, telling Armenian counterpart Robert Kocharian that Romania considers ties with Armenia a priority in its Black Sea policy.
Separately, a bilateral memorandum of understanding regarding co-operation in European and Euro-Atlantic integration issues was sealed.

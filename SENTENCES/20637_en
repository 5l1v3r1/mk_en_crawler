PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Sunday (March 9th) unveiled the first official Kosovo border sign reading "Welcome to the Republic of Kosovo". 
A large number of KFOR troops and Kosovo police were deployed for the brief ceremony at the Merdare administrative checkpoint between central Serbia and Kosovo. 
Thaci described the symbolic importance of the sign, written in English, Albanian and Serbian. 
"This plaque symbolises the border of the newest state of Kosovo, which divides the past from the future, isolation from the opening of a perspective for integration," he said.
Meanwhile, Serbian police managed to stop hundreds of ex-army reservists headed for Merdare, where they wanted to remove the sign. 
They vowed to try again on Monday.

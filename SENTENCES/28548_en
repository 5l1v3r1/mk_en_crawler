ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras says Greece welcomes the upcoming visit by a Turkish delegation to support normalisation of bilateral ties, but at the same time, said Ankara should back up its words with actions.
Wednesday's (October 13th) statement precedes a planned visit late next week by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for a conference on sustainable development in Athens.
Delavekouras also criticised a violation of Greek airspace by eight Turkish jets Tuesday.
"As long as this continues, there can be no normalisation of relations," he warned.

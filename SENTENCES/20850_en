BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO foreign ministers met on Thursday (March 6th) in Brussels but made no final decision about inviting the Adriatic Charter countries -- Macedonia, Albania and Croatia -- to join the Alliance at the upcoming summit in Bucharest.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said "all our allies are convinced that Euro-Atlantic integration is the key to durable peace and stability in the region".
He urged Greece and Macedonia to settle their longstanding name dispute in the weeks before the early-April meeting.
Addressing the forum, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis made it clear that Athens would block NATO membership for Macedonia until the issue is resolved.
She said Greece now favours extending membership invitations to Albania and Croatia only.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Washington favours invitations for all three.
She said the countries "have work to do by the summit in Bucharest, but they are doing so and should join the Alliance".

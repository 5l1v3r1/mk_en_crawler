SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is urging Macedonia to implement judicial and economic reforms, and to enhance interethnic political dialogue.
In an interview, published on Saturday (July 14th) by the Skopje daily Dnevnik, Rehn said progress in these areas would enable the Commission to recommend the official start of EU accession talks.
He described the main opposition ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration's return to Parliament -- after a lengthy boycott -- as a strong step forward.

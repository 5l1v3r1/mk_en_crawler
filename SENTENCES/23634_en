BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU Council of Ministers on Thursday (April 23rd) agreed to launch the procedure granting Montenegro the status of candidate for EU membership.
The Council sends the country's application to the European Commission (EC), which will issue its opinion on whether to accept Montenegro as an official candidate.
EC officials said the time required to conduct an in-depth study of the application would depend on the speed with which Montenegro responds to EU questions.
In the case of current candidate Croatia, the process took 14 months.
In other news Thursday, the EC said it will invest about 20m euros in environmental projects in Montenegro.
Leopold Maurer, head of the EC's delegation to Montenegro, made the announcement during an ecology fair in Budva.

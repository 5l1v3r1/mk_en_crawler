BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The British presidency of the EU on Thursday (29 September) called an extraordinary meeting of the EU foreign ministers to resolve a dispute with Austria over the European Commission's mandate for the upcoming accession talks with Turkey.
The ministers will discuss the issue Sunday, just hours ahead of Monday's scheduled start of the talks.
Austria wants the negotiating framework to include the possibility of granting Ankara the status of privileged partnership instead of full membership.
Ambassadors of the bloc's 25 member-states failed to reach an agreement on the issue Thursday.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said he would not travel to Brussels on Monday unless the EU adopts a mandate that reflects his country's desire for full membership.

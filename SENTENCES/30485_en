BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors on Wednesday (December 15th) charged two former ministers with abuse of office. 
Ex-Justice Minister Tudor Chiauriu and former Communications Minister Zsolt Nagy are suspected of involvement in a 2007 real estate deal that caused losses worth 8m euros to the state. 
In the deal, a top real estate property was transferred to a private company at an undervalued price. 
Chiauriu and Nagy signed papers to transfer the property, but deny any wrongdoing.

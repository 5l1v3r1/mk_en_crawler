PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) has accused former coalition partner and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni of blocking international recognitions of Kosovo.
PDK Vice-Chairman and Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said on Thursday (October 21st) that Hyseni, by resigning from his post, blocked 15 recognitions.
His party, the junior coalition partner Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), decided to leave the cabinet en masse on October 16th after almost four years of co-governance.
The move may trigger snap elections in December, despite the fact that early elections have already been set for February 2011.
Rexhepi says the recognitions had been promised but did not have time to materialise.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci had promised 100 recognitions soon after Kosovo declared independence in February 2008.
As of now, there are 70.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian ruling coalition member G17 Plus criticised the other governing parties on Saturday (17 July).
Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, who heads G17 Plus, said at a party leadership meeting that the government is not operating properly and cannot resolve the problems facing the country.
Labus did not say that G17 Plus is leaving the coalition, but he called for a majority government that could take a stand on all major issues.
The current ruling coalition does not include the Democratic Party, led by President Boris Tadic.
Also at the G17 Plus meeting Saturday, Federal Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic said Belgrade must find and extradite fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic or prove he is not hiding in Serbia-Montenegro.
"We have to determine whether General Mladic is here and extradite him ...
or clarify that he is not here and give evidence that no one can doubt," Davinic said.
He added that the political will to co-operate with The Hague was greater than ever, and cautioned that without such co-operation Serbia-Montenegro would not be able to join the EU.

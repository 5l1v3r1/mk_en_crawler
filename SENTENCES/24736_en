STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- The justice ministry on Thursday (December 4th) rejected a second pardon request by former Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic, who is serving an 11-year war crimes sentence there. 
The Hague war crimes tribunal sentenced Plavsic in 2003 after she admitted to playing a leading role in a campaign to persecute Croats and Muslims during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia. 
Plavsic requested early release from Sweden's Hinseberg prison based on her advancing age, failing health and poor prison conditions.
In other news Thursday, Italian Major General Stefano Castagnotto took command of EUFOR, at an official ceremony in Sarajevo. 
Castagnotto replaced Spanish Major General Ignacio Martin Villalain, who completed his one-year mandate as commander.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX is prepared to look into reports that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) trafficked in the organs of Serb prisoners held in Albanian prisons a decade ago, EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said on Saturday (April 11th).
"We are ready to investigate such reports if they exist," de Kermabon said after meeting with Albanian Justice Minister Enkeled Alibeaj in Tirana.
Just last week, two news organisations reported their findings after investigating claims that KLA members abducted civilians during the war in Kosovo and mistreated and killed them.
The allegations first surfaced in a book by Carla del Ponte, former chief prosecutor at The Hague war crimes tribunal.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Employees of elementary and secondary schools, as well as the staffs of research institutions, went on strike Wednesday (May 12th) despite encouraging negotiations between their trade unions and the cabinet, which dragged on through the night. 
Observers say is it likely a compromise will be struck, averting larger strikes. 
More sectors plan to join the strike in the next few days, with almost 100,000 protesters expected at a rally planned for Saturday. 
The education workers want the government to reinstate a 6% wage hike it abolished for budget reasons.
In other news Tuesday, the majority of parties in Slovenia's parliament approved EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's proposal to resolve the border dispute with Croatia, but only if it includes some of the amendments presented by Slovenia. 
This would seem to dampen prospects for any quick resolution, which in turn delays the resumption of Croatia's EU accession talks.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK told the Serbian government on Tuesday (October 23rd) to stop intimidating Kosovo Serbs who want to take part in next month's general election. 
A spokesman for the province's UN administration said there have been reports of Serbian and local Serb officials trying to dissuade voters from going to the polls on November 17th and using threats to force candidates out of the race.
The government in Belgrade has officially urged Serbs to boycott the vote, insisting that their situation in the province has not improved significantly. 
Serb officials have refused to assist in the implementation of the election by allowing schools to be used as polling stations. 
An OSCE spokesman says mobile teams will be dispatched to northern Kosovo's Serb-dominated areas to enable people to vote.

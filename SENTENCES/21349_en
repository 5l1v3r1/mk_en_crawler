ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Friday (September 26th) challenged critics within his New Democracy Party to either back its reform agenda or trigger early elections.
"I say 'no' to the constant undermining of this government.
To those who have other plans, face me head on:
topple this government," Karamanlis told a party conference.
"Otherwise, we will continue with our programme of reforms, privatisations and new taxes." Recently, a group of dissident party officials voiced harsh criticism of the cabinet's unpopular economic measures and a wave of scandals involving government members.

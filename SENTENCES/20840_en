STRASBOURG, France -- The anti-torture panel of the Council of Europe (CoE) found no evidence that Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), has been systemically poisoned by Turkish authorities.
The watchdog group cited a report released on Thursday (March 6th) that was based on an independent medical investigation of hair samples taken from Ocalan.
It found no toxins present.
The CoE, however, recommended that Ocalan's blood be tested every three months as a precaution.
He is the sole inmate at a prison in Imrali.
In other news, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani is making his first official visit to Turkey on Friday.
Officials are expected to seek more efforts from his government to combat the PKK's presence in northern Iraq.

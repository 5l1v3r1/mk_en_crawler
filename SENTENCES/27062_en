PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The health of miners from a bauxite mine near Niksic who went on strike last Monday is deteriorating, representative Marko Nikolic warned on Sunday (January 3rd). 
He said that 16 of the miners have requested medical assistance while six are battling lung problems. 
About 80 miners went underground a week ago to protest the fact they haven't been paid in four months. 
Though salaries for two of the four months have since been paid, the miners threatened to start hunger strikes if they do not receive their full wages.

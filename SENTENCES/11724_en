SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community Sunday (17 April condemned incidents that occurred during the ceremonial oath taking of Republika Srpska's (RS) new army recruits the previous day. 
The recruits at two bases swore to defend RS instead of BiH, thus violating the new BiH defence law. 
In a joint statement, the Office of the High Representative, NATO, the EU and the United States voiced grave concern, adding that the violation was a sign of continuing problems in the entity which could affect BiH's bid to join Euro-Atlantic structures.
In other news, the East Sarajevo Public Security Centre announced on Friday that EUFOR has established vehicle checkpoints in several areas in RS as part of its Spring Cleaning action. 
The campaign is aimed at fighting organised crime.

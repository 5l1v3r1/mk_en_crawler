SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of the government and armed forces, as well as domestic and foreign experts, gathered at a roundtable devoted to the country's new bill on crisis management Wednesday (15 September).
The participants agreed that improved co-ordination of state institutions and services in dealing with crises and security threats is a key challenge not only for Macedonia but also for most countries, including NATO members.
Also Wednesday, the opposition parties in parliament seemed divided over a proposed no confidence motion against the government.
A split seems to be developing among members of the main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE.
The motion is scheduled for Saturday.

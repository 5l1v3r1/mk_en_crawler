Plastic bags have become an enormous environmental problem in Macedonia, since they were introduced widely about 15 years ago. 
Even the Radika, the cleanest river in Macedonia, is at risk of becoming a garbage dump.
In addition, widespread use of paper bags has an environmental impact: forests are diminished in order to produce something that is used once or twice and then discarded.
To help improve matters, the environment ministry has launched a campaign to educate the public and encourage them to use bags made of environmentally friendly materials.
"The campaign," said Minister of Environment Zoran Sapuric, "is aimed at elevating public awareness of the necessity of a more engaged relation to decreasing everything that deteriorates and burdens the environment."
Bags made of fabric can be used multiple times, Sapuric noted. 
"Plastic bags are a part of household waste and their excessive usage is a problem even on the global level because it is increasingly growing," he added.
The campaign has received support from German Ambassador Irine Hinriksen and the head of the EC delegation in Macedonia, Donato Ciarini. 
It is being extended to other towns in Macedonia, with the topics expanded to cover all kinds of plastic waste.
Meanwhile, the environment ministry has also launched a recycling campaign, with the motto "reduce, reuse, recycle". 
It is being carried out with the help of the European Agency for Reconstruction, and in compliance with the country's new waste management law, passed in 2004.
As part of its bid to improve public awareness, the ministry has implemented a series of other campaigns, as well as organising public debates on Macedonia's new environmental protection legislation, aimed at meeting European standards. 
Roundtables have been held in five regions thus far, including almost every municipality in Macedonia.

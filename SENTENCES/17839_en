BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU External Relations Council called on Libyan authorities Monday (January 22nd) to ensure a "positive, fair and prompt solution" to the case of the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor, sentenced to death in a controversial HIV infection case. 
The EU foreign ministers voiced grave concern over the "unacceptable" verdict, stressing that it ignored strong scientific evidence that exonerated the medics. 
They also reiterated that the case would determine the course of future ties between the EU and Libya.

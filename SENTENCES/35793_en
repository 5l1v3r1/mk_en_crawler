ZAGREB, Croatia -- Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte told a Croatian TV station on Friday (30 January) that she was "convinced" that the government of Prime Minister Ivo Sanader would co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal. 
She also pledged to help Zagreb in its bid to join the EU. 
The prosecutor reassured the Croatian people that they should expect very few new indictments. 
"There is not much work left to be done," she said.

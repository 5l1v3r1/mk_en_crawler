ZAGREB, Croatia -- Justice Minister Ivan Simonovic said on Wednesday (October 14th) that the European Commission's (EC) progress report on Croatia urges the country to step up efforts to implement judicial reforms, but recognises some progress has been made.
It specifically urges Zagreb to resolve issues involving co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal that are related to the so-called "artillery diaries", stemming from the 1995 Operation Storm.
Simonovic said that Croatia will continue searching for the documents.

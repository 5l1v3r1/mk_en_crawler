ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatian President Stjepan Mesic commented Saturday (November 17th) that he opposes holding a referendum on Croatia's NATO membership. 
Speaking to reporters, Mesic added that NATO membership in no way jeopardizes the country's sovereignty and that Croatia can leave whenever it wants. 
By joining the Alliance, he said, Croatia will be able to open its borders, promote co-operation among national minorities and wrap up the war crimes prosecution process.
In other news, Russia says it is mulling over the technical issues involved in extraditing Yugoslavia's last Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijevic. 
Croatia has requested his extradition, holding him responsible for his command role in war crimes committed during Croatia's struggle for independence from Yugoslavia. 
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov confirmed that Moscow is studying the request.

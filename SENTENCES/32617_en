SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, was expected to impose the new law on BiH citizenship Monday (30 December).
Parliament's House of Representatives adopted the amended law earlier this month.
Since the House of Peoples has not yet taken office, Ashdown had to enact what is considered a key piece of legislation.
The law envisions extending the deadline for signing bilateral agreements on dual citizenship with other countries by another ten years, protecting the interests of thousands of BiH citizens living abroad whose status would have been questionable.
Also Monday, UNMIBH was expected to issue a certificate to the State Border Service, completing the process of accrediting law enforcement agencies.
The move follows seven years of reform aimed at ensuring the service and other agencies meet basic standards for democratic institutions.

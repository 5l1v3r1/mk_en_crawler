BELGRADE, Serbia -- The cabinet plans to discuss a draft law on determining the jurisdiction of the Vojvodina province Thursday (November 5th), a precondition for adopting the province's statute. 
The draft law was added to the agenda after Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic and Nenad Canak, leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina (LSV), agreed on amendments suggested by the party, which will be included in the draft version of the document. 
The LSV insists that Vojvodina have a capital city -- Novi Sad -- as well as its own Academy of Sciences and Arts, and that the province's autonomy cannot be undermined by other laws. 
Adoption of the bill has been delayed by disagreements over how much autonomy the province should retain. 
After passage by the cabinet, the law on transferring powers will be sent to parliament, along with the draft statute. 
It was adopted by the province's parliament more than a year ago.

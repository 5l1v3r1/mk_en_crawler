SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The interior ministry announced on Wednesday (December 1st) that it has busted an international human trafficking ring that was bringing illegal immigrants to the country from Iraq and Iran, via Turkey.
A Turkish national and three Bulgarians believed to be leaders of the gang have been arrested.
Authorities say a total of eight migrants were charged up to 3,000 euros each for fake Bulgarian passports that would allow them to enter other EU member states.
An investigation is under way.

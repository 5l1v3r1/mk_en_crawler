NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Support is split virtually evenly among the three leading candidates in Sunday's (February 17th) presidential election.
New polls suggest incumbent President Tassos Papadopoulos, Parliament Speaker Demetris Christofias and former Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides enjoy around 30% support each.
A poll commissioned by the Simerini newspaper gives the three candidates 32.6%, 32.1% and 30.5%, respectively.
According to the online newspaper Phileleftheros, Papadopoulos is backed by 32.7% of the electorate, Christofias would take 30.3%, and Kasoulides would receive 30%.
The differences are within the poll's margin of error.

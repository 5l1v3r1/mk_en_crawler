TIRANA, Albania -- The reform process in the armed forces made clear progress in meeting NATO accession standards, says Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who conducted an annual review of the defence ministry's performance Wednesday (22 January). 
Nano said "reforms in the armed forces aim at realising one of the standing guarantees for the country's security and stability, as a fundamental element of the Euro-Atlantic integration process." (ATA - 22/01/03)

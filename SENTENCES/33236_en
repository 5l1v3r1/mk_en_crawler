BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian Orthodox Christians living in central and northern Europe met in Nuremberg, Germany on Saturday (10 May) and decided to launch a campaign to build the Nation's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest. 
Around 700 Romanians from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden attended the meeting and pledged to collect funds in support of the project. 
The Romanian government has contributed land in Bucharest's Carol Park for the initiative.

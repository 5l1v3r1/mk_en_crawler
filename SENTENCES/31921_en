TIRANA, Albania -- An IMF delegation says economic growth has slowed and GDP growth by the end of 2002 is expected to be only 4.5 to 5 per cent, according to a report by Albanian Radio on Friday (25 October). 
The IMF reportedly blames the energy crisis and the floods of September for the economic slowdown. 
Also affected were privatisation projects. 
The delegation reportedly highlighted the need for more private sector investments and an improved business climate.

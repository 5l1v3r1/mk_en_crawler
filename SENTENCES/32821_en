PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia -- Chief Prosecutor Bozidar Vukcevic flatly denied Wednesday (4 December) any involvement in the current high-profile sex-slave scandal.
He described the allegations against him and calls for resignation as efforts "to discredit him professionally and personally".
Vukcevic's deputy, Zoran Piperovic, was arrested over the weekend in connection with the scandal, which began after a Moldovan woman, forced into prostitution, incriminated several state officials.

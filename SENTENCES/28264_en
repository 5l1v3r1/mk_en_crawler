ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police detained a manager and three former officials of the national motorways company, HAC, on Wednesday (November 17th), for suspected abuse of power and embezzlement of 26m kunas (3.5m euros). 
Police Director Oliver Grbic confirmed that the four were arrested as part of an investigation led by the anti-corruption office, USKOK, into a scandal involving the private Fimi Media Company. 
The consulting agency, which had been handling government PR, is believed to have helped siphon millions from state-owned companies and ministries.

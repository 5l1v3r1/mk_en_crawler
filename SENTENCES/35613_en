SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The environment ministry said Thursday (8 April) that ferro-nickel and chromium mines near Podgradec, Albania, are not polluting Lake Ohrid. 
The ministry cited the results of recent joint inspections by Macedonian and Albanian environmentalists into the high level of heavy metals near the Albanian side of the lake. 
The ministry added, however, that Tirana plans to move mine assets farther from the lake.
In other news Thursday, Pakistani police confirmed that they have detained the remaining five members of a militant gang accused of organising a terrorist attack on the Macedonian consulate in Karachi on 5 December 2002. 
The bomb blast killed three people. 
All nine suspects allegedly have confessed.

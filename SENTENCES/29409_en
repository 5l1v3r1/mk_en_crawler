SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Several US congressmen have sent a letter to President Barack Obama in support of Macedonia's NATO bid, local media reported on Saturday (October 2nd).
In the letter, the 19 Congress members say that the United States should encourage members of the Alliance to offer a membership invitation to the country at the upcoming November summit in Lisbon.
They also say that Macedonia's NATO membership should not be linked to the final outcome of the long-standing name dispute between Skopje and Athens.
"Macedonia's future in Euro-Atlantic institutions, as well as the security and stability of Southeast Europe, must no longer be negatively affected by bilateral issues with Greece," the letter reads.
It was sent to the president ahead of Macedonian Defence Minister Zoran Konjanovski's visit to the United States next week.
Copies also went to Vice-President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defence Secretary Robert Gates.

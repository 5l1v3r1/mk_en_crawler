The car business is booming in Romania.
According the Car Producers and Importers Association (APIA), last year Romanians bought 256,000 new vehicles -- 42 per cent more than in the same period in 2004, and almost double for all of 2002.
There are several explanations.
First, the 16 per cent flat tax on revenues introduced in January 2005 increased wages in the country by as much as 30 per cent.
Also, 2005 was the first year during which the national currency's exchange rate appreciated.
For example, in October 2004, $1 was valued at 33,000 lei and 1 euro at 41,000 lei.
In March 2005, the rates were 27,000 lei for $1 and 36,000 lei for 1 euro.
Car prices in Romania are in euros and sometimes dollars, making the vehicles 12 per cent to 18 per cent cheaper.
Economic growth has also played a role, as well as the new 1,000-euro state subsidy for those who replaced cars that were 12 or more years old.
"I bought a brand new Renault Megane Sedan a few months ago.
My sister has been driving a Skoda Fabia since March 2005.
It was a new car too," says Florin Tarcatu, a 32-year-old sales adviser from Bucharest.
"My best friend is waiting now for an Opel Astra to be delivered from Germany.
Two of my colleagues and three of my neighbours also changed their cars last year and they all bought new vehicles."
Such stories can be heard now all over the country, but especially in the big cities, among those who are 25 to 45 and earning at least twice the average monthly salary of 200 euros.
Despite such encouraging results, most car dealers are looking towards the future with anxiety.
"We hope the authorities will hear our cry and will take the necessary measures for stopping Romania from becoming, after January 2007, a second Poland," said Dacia Logan Commercial Manager Jean-Michel Sicre during an APIA meeting.
Sicre was referring to the way the Polish car market reacted after the EU accession in May 2004, when all import restrictions were abolished.
Other new EU members have taken a different path and imposed restrictions on imports of used cars.
"Romania should do the same when becoming an EU member.
Officials have to understand they have to protect the local car factories, the environment and the safety of the traffic," said APIA's president, Brent Valmar.
Among the possible solutions is a ban on imports of vehicles that do not comply with rules on pollution control.
Others have suggested a tax should be paid by the importer in accordance with the number of kilometres the car has travelled.
Still another idea is to implement regulations similar to those in the Czech Republic, where no car older than eight years can be registered.
On the street, however, opinions differ.
"Instead of paying 1,000 euros to 1,500 euros for an eight to ten-year-old Dacia, famous for its lack of reliability and safety, I would [rather] give the same money for a Western car which nowadays I can't register in Romania," explains Dan Toader, 48, a farmer from Prahova County.
And it seems the first signs the market is changing has already arrived.
In the first three months of this year, Romanian dealers sold 58,000 new cars, only 4.3 per cent more than in the same period of 2005.

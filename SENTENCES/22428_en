PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said on Monday (June 9th) that Montenegro continues to follow the processes related to recognising Kosovo's independence very carefully and, based on this, will announce its position on the issue. 
At a press conference marking the 100th day of his government, Djukanovic explained that Montenegro's main priority is becoming a member of the EU and NATO. 
He said the first 100 days have resulted in "radical progress" in efforts to fight corruption in the judiciary.

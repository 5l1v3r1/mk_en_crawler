SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Agriculture Minister Miroslav Naydenov warned on Tuesday (August 4th) that Bulgaria may have to return direct agricultural payments from the EU for 2007 and may not receive any for 2009.
The problem is the satellite photos of arable land that have not been updated, despite a looming end-of-September deadline.
Failure to comply would deny subsidies of around 350m euros this year alone, and a total of 3.2 billion euros of direct agricultural subsidies by the end of 2013.
Furthermore, Bulgaria may have to return money received for 2007, due to widespread fraud and procedural violations.
In other news, an earthquake measuring about 5.0 on the Richter scale rocked northern Bulgaria and parts of southern Romania late Wednesday morning.
No injuries were reported but some homes were slightly damaged.
Also Wednesday, severe storms battered western Bulgaria, including the Sofia area.
Flooding is reported, and three villages in the Montana region were left without electricity.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Negotiations are under way to allow a Serb virtual mobile operator in Kosovo, local media reported on Wednesday (May 5th), quoting unnamed senior officials.
The government and the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) are said to be negotiating with Belgrade through Brussels.
The talks, sources say, started after the TRA began removing the transmitters of Serbia's operators in Kosovo, arguing they are illegal since no taxes are paid to Pristina.
"The negotiations are on a political level.
In order not to leave the Serb community without any operator, the TRA has started the talks to license a Serb virtual operator which will function in co-operation with one of Kosovo's mobile companies," the source said.
Kosovo has two mobile operators and two virtual companies providing service to the country.

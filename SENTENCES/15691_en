PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said on Thursday (November 23rd) that he does not want the issue of border demarcation with Macedonia included in UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's status proposal. 
During a meeting with Ceku in Pristina, however, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said his country still wants the border issue resolved either before or during the final status announcement.
While in Pristina, Milososki also met with UNMIK deputy chief Steven Schook and Rangel Noikic, president of the province's Minority Rights Commission.

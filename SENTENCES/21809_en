ATHENS, Greece -- Truckers are clogging the roads around Athens this week, after ending a ten-day strike by transport companies seeking concessions from the government to offset record high fuel prices. 
The government refused to allow them to increase surcharges, but did make two concessions -- trucks will be allowed to use national highways on Fridays, and fuel trucks will be able to use tunnels.

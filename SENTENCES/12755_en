BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Romanian Intelligence Agency (SRI) is to transfer the files of the Communist-era secret police, the Securitate, to the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS).
Both SRI and CNSAS agreed on the move Thursday (3 March) and also decided to set up a joint commission to evaluate the documents.
The issue has been a politically sensitive one.
Also Thursday, Amnesty International released a report that concludes conditions in Romania's psychiatric institutions continue to breach international human rights standards.
The organisation cited overcrowding, poor living conditions, and "inhuman and degrading treatment of patients".

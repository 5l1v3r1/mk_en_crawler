PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs in northern Kosovo headed to the polls Sunday (May 30th) in local elections organised by Serbia. 
Albanians in the southern part of Mitrovica vowed to protest voting in the northern half of their city and in Novo Brdo. 
Reportedly, Serbs displaced in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kraljevo, Kragujevac and Nis are also eligible to vote.
Assembly Speaker Jakup Krasniqi conceded on Friday that Kosovo institutions lack the power to stop the unauthorised elections. 
Local media are reporting that the EULEX mission advised its personnel to avoid Mitrovica on Sunday. 
On Saturday, International Civilian Representative and EU Special Representative Pieter Feith told VOA that the EU will not recognise the results of these elections.

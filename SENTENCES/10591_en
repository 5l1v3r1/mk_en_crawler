BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government reports there have been 67 interethnic incidents in the province of Vojvodina so far this year.
In a report to parliament on Friday (10 September), Interior Minister Dragan Jojic said 23 were acts of vandalism in graveyards and 18 were violent assaults.
In six of the cases, the victims were members of the province's Hungarian minority.
Two ethnic Hungarian deputies disputed the government figures, insisting the actual number of incidents is much higher.

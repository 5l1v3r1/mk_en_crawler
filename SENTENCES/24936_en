SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says BiH should be separated as the former Czechoslovakia was, with the new countries formed from that joining the EU individually.
"We suggest that BiH should be transformed into a federation whose federal units have the right of self-identification," Dodik told the Zagreb-based daily Jutarnji List on Saturday (February 28th).
"Why not follow Czechoslovakia's model for the purpose of faster EU accession," he added.
The country divided into its two federal units through a peaceful agreement in January 1993.
Both newly formed states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, joined the EU in 2004.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia must learn to live with the outcome of the Kosovo status talks, whatever it might be, US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said in an interview in Saturday's (October 14th) Blic. 
As for defining Kosovo as part of Serbia in the new draft constitution, Polt said that Serbia had the right to make such arguments, but they would not affect the final settlement. 
No side can impose a solution unilaterally, he said.
Also Saturday, Serbia and the United States marked the 125th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties. 
Polt used the occasion to stress that a bright future for Serbia is in the interest of its people and the United States.

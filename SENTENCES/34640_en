SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Economy Minister Ilija Filipovski outlined possible measures Sunday (24 August) to stimulate foreign investment in Macedonia. 
In an interview with Radio Free Europe, he said the most important move would be the establishment of a single institution to handle investments, instead of the current system of several entities responsible for the process. 
Other measures include the elimination of bribery and corruption and the creation of a healthy business environment. 
Filipovski also suggested that money-losing companies that have not attracted investor interest in the privatisation process be declared free economic zones and offered to foreign investors.

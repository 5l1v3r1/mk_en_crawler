ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Serbian war crimes prosecutor's office will deliver a copy of a file against Croatian war veteran Tihomir Purda to Croatian authorities.
Purda was arrested last week in Bosnia and Herzegovina based on a warrant issued by Belgrade.
The agreement was struck during a meeting of the Croatian-Serbian commission dealing with war crimes suspects' issues, held in Zagreb on Wednesday (January 12th), chaired by Croatian Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic and Serbian counterpart Snezana Malovic.
The commission also concluded that within seven days, Serbia will deliver data about Croatian citizens wanted in Serbia for war crimes.

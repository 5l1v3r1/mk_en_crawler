TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament has approved the establishment of a commission on strengthening the electoral code, according to a report Wednesday (7 July) by the Albanian Daily News.
The country's ruling and opposition parties agreed on the move last week, in what the international community is hailing as a demonstration of political maturity.
However, some lawmakers from the ruling Socialist Party (SP) are questioning the legality of the agreement between the SP and the Democratic Party which created the commission.
They have asked the Constitutional Court to issue a ruling.

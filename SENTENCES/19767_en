BELGRADE, Serbia -- Diplomats from the international community who acknowledge that Belgrade's and Pristina's positions over Kosovo's status are not getting any closer are discussing new models to resolve the issue, Serbia's Blic daily reported on Friday (September 21st).
A source close to the Contact Group says one option being discussed within international circles is to resolve the Kosovo issue using the Hong Kong model.
This model, Blic's source explained, takes into account the positions of both sides and may help overcome strong differences between Belgrade and Pristina.
The model would be a transitional solution to the issue, limited in time.
Meanwhile on Thursday, Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic told Reuters that his country would need EU support to apply Kosovo's self-governance plan, if it were accepted by the Albanian majority.
"We are trying to be as realistic as possible," Samardzic said, adding that Belgrade was not seeking absolute victory over the Kosovo Albanians, which account for 90% of the province's population, but offering a "conciliatory" solution.

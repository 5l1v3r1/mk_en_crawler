SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands attended the funeral Wednesday (October 3rd) of Republika Srpska (RS) President Milan Jelic, who died of a massive heart attack on Sunday.
He was 51.
He was buried in his home town of Modrica, as RS, BiH and Serbian dignitaries, as well as International Community High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, looked on.
BiH's Election Commission and RS authorities are to meet on Thursday in Banja Luka to discuss the issue of succession and the organisation of new elections.
The RS parliament appointed Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic as interim president and said new elections will be called within three months.
That concerns non-Serb parties however, who say one of the two RS vice presidents -- a Bosniak and a Croat -- should assume Jelic's duties.

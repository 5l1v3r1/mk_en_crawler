SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Minister of State Administration Dimitar Kalchev, who is perceived as close to the leftist opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), said Monday (14 March) that a possible election coalition between the ruling NMS-II and BSP would be "sound".
Speaking on national bTV, Kalchev said that since these two parties have the best chance of winning the next general elections, a coalition between them in the next parliament would benefit the country.

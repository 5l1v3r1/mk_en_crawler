PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The death toll is climbing in a tragedy involving Kosovo Albanians who tried to illegally enter Hungary from Serbia via the Tisza River earlier this month. 
Serbian police recovered two more bodies Tuesday (October 27th), one of them a child, bringing the confirmed death toll to five. 
One survivor has said as many as 15 illegal immigrants were aboard the boat that capsized and sank.

TIRANA, Albania -- The country has not done enough to meet the requirements for abolishing the visa regime with the EU, local media reported on Sunday (May 17th), citing a report by the European Commission. 
The document officially appears on Monday. 
Overall results are mixed, it stressed. 
"There is progress recorded in the fields of justice, freedom and security, but Albania has not met European standards in border control, issuing of documents, migration, fighting terrorism, organised crime and corruption," the document said. 
Albania is hoping to gain a slot on the so-called White Schengen list by January.

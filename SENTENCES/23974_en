ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish security forces have killed three members of the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in clashes in the southern province of Hatay, the army said on Saturday (July 18th), in a statement posted on its web site.
The fighting broke out Friday in a mountainous area near the Syrian border after a group of PKK militants tried to cross over the border.
An operation is under way to search for the other PKK militants who managed to escape, the statement added.

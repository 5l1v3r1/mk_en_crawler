TIRANA, Albania -- Several days of rain triggered flooding again in northeast Albania on Wednesday (October 6th). 
The level of the Drin River began rising quickly after the hydro power plant at Vau Dejes began to offload the water in the dams, which are near capacity. 
The floods have hit villages mainly in the Shkodra region, but authorities say residents are safe. 
Massive floods swamped the same region in December, as a result of water coming from hydro power plants.

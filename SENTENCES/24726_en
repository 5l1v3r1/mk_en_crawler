PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said on Tuesday (March 3rd) that the best way for EULEX to prove its functionality was to deploy all across the country. 
"In order to be operational throughout the territory of Kosovo, EULEX should function in the place where it is needed most, which is northern Kosovo," Krasniqi said. 
Commenting on a protest by a group of Serbs in northern Mitrovica, who tried to prevent EULEX's work in the area by blocking the entrance of the local district court, Krasniqi said this "barrier" was one of the difficulties EULEX was facing. 
He stressed, however, that the mission was accountable to Brussels, not to Pristina.

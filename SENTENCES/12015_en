LONDON, Britain -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the BBC on Wednesday (13 April) that she expects arrests of major war crimes indictees by July, the tenth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. 
She said the international community has a duty to bring Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic to justice. 
The two former Bosnian Serb leaders are blamed for the deaths of more than 7,000 Muslims in Srebrenica.
In other news, former Bosnian Serb army officer Milorad Trbic appeared before the UN tribunal on Wednesday to answer charges in connection with the massacre. 
He requested, and received, a 30-day delay of the plea hearing.
Also Wednesday, former Republika Srpska Army Security Chief Ljubisa Beara pleaded not guilty before The Hague tribunal. 
Beara, described as Mladic's right-hand man, also faces charges stemming from Srebrenica.

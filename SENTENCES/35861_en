BUCHAREST, Romania -- At least five people died in Turkey and two in Romania as heavy winter storms and freezing temperatures hit the Black Sea.
Navigation through the Bosporus was reopened Saturday (24 January).
The straits had been closed for two days because of strong winds and poor visibility.
Navigation on certain sections of the Danube was also halted.
Three of Romania's Black Sea ports were closed for the third day Saturday when winds reached speeds in excess of 120 km per hour.

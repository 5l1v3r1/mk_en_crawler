VIENNA, Austria -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, who has spent weeks now in custody in Salzburg, complains of a media witch hunt in his country. 
In an interview with the daily Salzburger Nachrichten Saturday (January 22nd), he said he is a victim of a smear campaign, organised by his successor, Jadranka Kosor. 
He says she is scared he might return to politics. 
Sanader also complained that his right to a fair defence is limited as media and politicians have already convicted him. 
He denies allegations of possible criminal actions and abuse of power, saying witnesses are being pressured to testify against him. 
Kosor refused to comment directly on Sanader's statements, saying that the fight against corruption can only benefit Croatia.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Pierre-Richard Prosper, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes, called Monday (6 October) for a closer partnership between BiH officials and SFOR in finding top war crimes suspects.
"The US is prepared to play a strong role in this process, but we also expect the local authorities to do the same," he said after talks with members of the country's tripartite presidency.
Prosper is to meet officials in Republika Srpska on Tuesday.
In other news, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte visited Croatia on Monday to discuss the government's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
She urged retired General Ante Gotovina, the UN court's third most-wanted suspect, to surrender immediately.
President Stipe Mesic also called on Gotovina to surrender, amid concerns the case will affect prospects for eventual EU accession.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The annual global meeting of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines began in Sarajevo on Monday (3 May) with more than 100 researchers and participants from 70 countries. 
Among them is Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch, the former high representative to BiH. 
He said Monday that the country is moving closer to Europe, with progress in refugee return, property repossession and institution building.
In other news, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said Monday that the government is unable to assume full responsibility for the fight against terrorism. 
His comment was in response to a new report by the US State Department that concluded combating organised crime in BiH has slowed since the nationalists took power in late 2002.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The US envoy for Kosovo status talks, Frank Wisner, called on Serbia Monday (17 April) to play a constructive role in the negotiations.
Visiting Belgrade as part of his tour of the region, Wisner met with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
He stressed that a constructive approach by authorities in Belgrade and participation of Kosovo Serbs in the provincial institutions would contribute to a "peaceful, democratic Kosovo that protects the rights of all its residents".
For his part, Kostunica reiterated Serbia's opposition to Kosovo independence and said Belgrade would soon announce a proposal for autonomy that meets all European standards.

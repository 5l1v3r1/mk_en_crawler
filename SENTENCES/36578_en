SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Electoral Commission Chairman Vehid Sehic announced on Tuesday (3 August) the start of the municipal election campaign.
He said a total of 68 political parties, 146 independent candidates, eight coalitions and six lists of independent candidates will participate in the elections, which will take place on 2 October.
Voters will be choosing 3,145 municipal council members and 139 mayors.
At a separate press conference, Office of the High Representative spokesman Kevin Sullivan called on BiH politicians to attract voters with policy programmes rather than with nationalistic statements.
He also urged voters to press politicians to reduce unemployment and improve public services, including schools, infrastructure and medical care.
In other news Tuesday, the OSCE mission in BiH announced it will launch a project to strengthen internal control in municipalities.
The OSCE will first help local governments in both entities draft rules on internal control, and afterwards train the necessary staff to apply them.
The initiative is part of the OSCE's assistance in public administration reform.

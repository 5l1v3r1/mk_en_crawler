ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and the country's chief negotiator with the EU, Ali Babacan, said at a joint press conference on Tuesday (April 17th) that Turkey is committed to further reforms, regardless of whether the EU eventually approves its bid for membership.
The two ministers presented a 400-page reform guide that includes a detailed timeline for the steps to be taken.
The government wants to have the reforms in place by 2014, they said.
"We maintain our goal of EU membership with determination," Gul said, adding that the problems that have come up with the talks -- particularly the suspension of eight chapters over Turkey's refusal to open airports and seaports to Cypriot traffic -- are political.
"When the political problems are one day resolved, we will meet with the EU and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters."
In response, the European Commission said it welcomed Turkey's plans for reform.
However, Brussels did not comment on Ankara's claims that it would be ready to join the EU by 2013.

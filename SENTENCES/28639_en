BELGRADE, Serbia -- Alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric is suing Serbia over statements by top officials that he says breached his presumption of innocence. 
Saric's lawyer, Zdenko Tomanovic, announced on Monday (September 13th) that he has filed the suit, which seeks 95,000 euros in compensation. 
"Representatives of states bodies cannot publicly judge or proclaim anyone guilty, including Darko Saric, before a trial has started," Tomanovic said. 
Members of Saric's group are scheduled to go on trial next week. 
In April, he and 19 others were charged with smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America. 
Saric and six others remain at large.

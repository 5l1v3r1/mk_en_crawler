SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Central Election Commission (CIK) on Thursday (March 24th) annulled last week's vote at the Federation of BiH's (FBiH) House of Peoples to elect the entity's president, vice-presidents and government.
Outgoing President Borjana Kristo had filed the complaint, arguing that both the constitution and the election law were violated during the session.
The CIK says it annulled the vote because not all Croat seats were verified.
The two main Croat parties, HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990 both boycotted the vote last week.
The CIK had earlier said that the conditions for holding the constitutive session of the upper house of the FBiH parliament were not met, as three Croat-dominated cantons had failed to nominate their delegates.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Kosovo's Serb political leaders have decided to encourage their community to vote in Sunday's (26 October) local elections in the province, but only in those municipalities in which they feel they are adequately protected. 
"Elections will be organised only in areas where Serbs have appropriate security and freedom of movement," Oliver Ivanovic, a prominent Serb leader, said Tuesday after a meeting with Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica. 
The Kosovo Serbs boycotted the previous municipal vote, but took part in the general elections last year. 
A UN spokesman expressed disappointment with the decision to limit voting to only a few areas, saying it would discourage the mass return of Serb refugees to Kosovo.

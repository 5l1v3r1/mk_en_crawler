PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU Special Representative in Kosovo, Pieter Feith, called on all stakeholders Thursday (March 31st) to respect the decision of the Constitutional Court regarding the violation of procedures while electing the president. 
The court ruled that Behgjet Pacolli's election as president breached the constitution due to lack of quorum and a counter candidate. 
Feith called on lawmakers from the opposition to participate in assembly sessions in order not to repeat the same mistakes and to enable election of the president.

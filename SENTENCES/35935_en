ANKARA, Turkey -- State Minister Abdullatif Sener said Thursday (15 January) that negotiations based on the Cyprus plan proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan would be appropriate for both the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and for Turkey. 
Though he stopped short of approving the plan, Sener described it as a good starting point for agreement on an issue that must be resolved soon. 
Local media are reporting that negotiations might begin in Geneva, during the first week of February.
In related developments Thursday, US Secretary of State Colin Powell sent a message to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat, congratulating him on the results of the 14 December elections that made him leader of the new governing coalition.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier kicks off a round of shuttle diplomacy Wednesday (July 23rd) in Belgrade in an effort to overcome Serbia's opposition to the international civilian administration in Kosovo.
UNMIK spokesperson Russell Geekie said that Zannier "is eager to begin dialogue" on issues outlined in UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's recent letters to Serbian President Boris Tadic and Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu.
In those letters, Ban said Zannier will be discussing a number of issues, including Serb involvement in several Kosovo institutions.
Visiting Brussels Wednesday, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said Washington wants the international community to regain control over northern Kosovo, which he called a "lawless area", adding "There has to be a presence in the north.
We cannot allow the situation in Kosovo to drift."
In other news, Kosovo Minister of Local Government Sadri Ferati said on Tuesday that the lack of co-operation between the government and Kosovo Serbs could hinder the decentralisation process.
"We will work on the ...
process, but if Serbs resist and ask for more time, it will only be a waste of time," Ferati told Radio Free Europe.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government signed an agreement with the United States on Friday (4 April) under which a company of Bulgarian chemical decontamination experts will travel to the Gulf to help in the operation to disarm the Iraqi regime. 
Washington will pay the transportation and everyday expenses of the 97 soldiers. 
The Bulgarian government did not disclose the date and location of the deployment, but newspapers reported that the troops would join US forces in Jordan. 
In February, parliament authorised the deployment of up to 150 troops in a country neighbouring Iraq.

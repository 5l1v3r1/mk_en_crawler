BUCHAREST, Romania -- Superior Magistrates Council (CSM) members elected their new president Thursday (January 10th), with Judge Lidia Barbulescu tapped to replace Judge Anton Pandrea. 
The only vote against her was reportedly cast by Prosecutor General Laura Codruta Kovesi. 
Gratiana Isac was elected CSM vice-president.
Also Thursday, during a press conference at Victoria Palace, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu urged President Traian Basescu to accept the nomination of Norica Nicolai as justice minister. 
Tariceanu said Romania can't afford delays as there is a European Commission report on the judiciary being released soon. 
Basescu has urged Tariceanu to propose someone with a better public image.

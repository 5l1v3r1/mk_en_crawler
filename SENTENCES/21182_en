ANKARA, Turkey -- After he forms his cabinet, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit France and the United Kingdom, his office announced on Tuesday (July 31st).
Erdogan will meet with British counterpart Gordon Brown in London to discuss bilateral relations and international issues.
In France, Erdogan will hold talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy about Turkey's EU membership bid.
In other news Tuesday, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) gave a measured response to remarks Monday by General Staff Chief General Yasar Buyukanit, who reiterated the army's support for a secular president.
Despite expectations that Buyukanit's statement would revive tensions between the secularist army and the Islamist-rooted AKP, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said he appreciated Buyukanit's views.

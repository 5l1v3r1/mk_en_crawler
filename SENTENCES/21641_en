MOSCOW, Russia -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic says likely that Russia will introduce a visa-free regime for all Serbian citizens before the New Year holidays.
Dacic was in Moscow on Wednesday (November 26th) for a meeting of the inter-governmental committee for economic and commercial co-operation between Russia and Serbia.
Moscow has proposed cancelling all visas for Serbian citizens within a month, Dacic says, since Belgrade has already removed visas for Russian nationals staying in Serbia for up to three months.

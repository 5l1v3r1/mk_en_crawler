PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX is ready to provide guarantees to The Hague war crimes tribunal for the provisional release of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj until his trial begins.
On Wednesday (August 25th), the media published a letter by EULEX Deputy Head Roy Reeve to the UN tribunal, stating that the mission is ready to guarantee that if released, Haradinaj will stay in Pristina or at his home in the village of Gllogjan.
Reeve was responding to a letter from the tribunal last week, asking EULEX if it can fulfil the condition.
The tribunal's press office said a decision will be made soon.
Haradinaj returned to The Hague in July after the court ordered a partial re-trial of his war crimes case.
He heads the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo.

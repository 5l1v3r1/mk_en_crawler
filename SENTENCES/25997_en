BELGRADE, Serbia -- Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said on Thursday (October 15th) that Serbia is not currently interested in applying for NATO membership, nor has the Alliance set this as a condition for boosting co-operation. 
He also noted that parliament has adopted a resolution regarding military neutrality. 
In an article published in the weekly NIN, Sutanovac stressed that Serbia's priority is to become an active member of NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, given the difficult history between Serbia and NATO.
In other news Thursday, members of the Serbian Security and Information Agency and the US Drug Enforcement Administration seized 2.8 tonnes of cocaine apparently destined for European markets. 
The value of the drugs, seized in international waters in the Atlantic, is estimated at 120m euros.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Commenting on a likely independence referendum, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said Monday (23 May) that the legal provisions for such a poll would not be amended and the current 50 per cent plus 1 vote validity requirement would remain in force. 
In a media interview, Vujanovic again implied that the referendum would likely be held in February 2006, even if Serbia agreed with Podgorica's demand for revision of the federal union agreement and a looser confederation.

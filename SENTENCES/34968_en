SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Representatives of the international community held a joint news conference on Thursday (11 December), praising government approval of a package of laws on power decentralisation.
An EU spokeswoman described the move as a significant step forward, crucial to implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accord and to Macedonia's efforts to become a member of the Union.
The bill envisions reducing the number of municipalities and sets new principles for their financing.
It also permits the use of minority languages in communities in which the minority group makes up more than 20 per cent of the population.
The package of laws moves next to parliament.

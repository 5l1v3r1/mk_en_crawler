SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The government plans to apply for EU membership candidate status within the next four months, Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj was quoted as saying by the Oslobodjenje daily on Thursday (August 12th).
"We have big support from the EU for this step.
If the EU policies are defined as expected, I guess that we will submit our application for candidate status by the end of this year," he said.
He added that by October at the latest, the EU will have precisely defined its policy towards the Western Balkans, which should result in the introduction of special representatives for the region.
Alkalaj noted that it can take at least 18 months to approve an application for candidate status.
So far, BiH has only signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, which has been ratified by 24 of the 27 bloc members.

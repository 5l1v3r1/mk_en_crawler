BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) government urged all war criminals to surrender voluntarily to The Hague tribunal via RS authorities.
Thursday's (17 July) appeal came a day before a visit by the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte.
Officials also said that if war crimes suspects surrender, they could receive certain guarantees and financial assistance worth about 200 euros per month.
In addition, the government announced it would establish a special office for co-ordination with the tribunal.
The office would collect documentation and evidence regarding networks of supporters, in line with lists compiled by the EU and the United States.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The global anti-corruption watchdog group Transparency International (TI) announced on Thursday (October 12th) that it has decided to revoke the accreditation of its Macedonian branch, TI Macedonia.
The move denies the branch the right to use the TI name and logo or claim association with the TI movement.
The organisation said it did so to protect its reputation, but did not elaborate.

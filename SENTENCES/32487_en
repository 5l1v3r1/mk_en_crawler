ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says a vote by parliament on a government motion to allow the United States to deploy more than 60,000 troops for an operation against Baghdad is not on the immediate agenda. 
Speaking late Friday (14 March), he explained that debate will be scheduled only after parliament holds a vote of confidence on his new cabinet, expected late this week. 
White House special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was in Ankara on Saturday for talks about the impact of the Iraq crisis. 
Erdogan has indicated Ankara will seek stronger guarantees from Washington that Kurds in northern Iraq would not pose an immigration problem if military action begins.

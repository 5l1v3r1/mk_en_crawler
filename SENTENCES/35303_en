WASHINGTON, United States -- The World Bank on Thursday (17 June) approved the $1 billion 3rd Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL III) for Turkey. 
It will provide support for the government's financial and public sector reform priorities, while ensuring that social programmes are adequately funded and better targeted.
Also Thursday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan predicted the EU would launch accession negotiations with Turkey in March 2005. 
Talks would start if the European Commission's report on Turkey at the end of this year is positive, he noted. 
Erdogan is in Brussels, attending the EU summit.

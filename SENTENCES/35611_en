BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic urged Serbs in Republika Srpska on Thursday (8 April) to accept the truth of the Srebrenica massacre.
He was speaking in context of a report on Europe's worst atrocity since WWII, that is due to be released later this month.
Bosnian Serb authorities set up an independent commission late in January to study the Srebrenica massacre, under strong pressure from the international community.
A previous report by a government-appointed panel downplayed the incident, sparking outrage.
In other news, officials say a key suspect in last month's Madrid train bombings was born in Mostar.
Still unclear however is whether Sanel Sjekirica, 24, retains BiH citizenship.
His father says Sjekirica is a student in Spain.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The US government and senior European officials signalled Monday (4 November) that they are ready to co-operate with the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which won Turkey's general elections by a landslide Sunday. 
Undersecretary for Political Affairs Marc Grossman reiterated US readiness to maintain close ties with Turkey and urged the EU to set a date for starting accession talks with Ankara. 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was encouraged by the signals he was getting from the AKP and pledged to continue working to bring it closer to the EU. 
Germany and the European Commission also voiced satisfaction with the messages they were getting from Ankara. 
EU security chief Javier Solana noted that the next Turkish government would be judged by its actions.
AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, again reiterated his party's desire to join the EU and announced plans to visit Greece and several European capitals in the coming weeks. 
The party leadership will meet Tuesday to discuss its choice for prime minister. 
Erdogan is ineligible, due to a 1999 conviction for inciting religious hatred.

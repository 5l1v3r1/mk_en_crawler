TIRANA, Albania -- The cabinet approved a letter of intent Saturday (19 June) on building a high-power line with Montenegro.
At issue is the construction and use of a line connecting Elbasan, Albania to Podgorica, Montenegro.
The line would link the Adriatic coast with the Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity in Europe.
The line is also important to the power systems of surrounding countries -- Greece, Macedonia and Serbia.

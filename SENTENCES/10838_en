BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Romania presents a report to the EU on Friday (3 September) concerning the progress it has made towards EU accession.
The ministry for European integration issued a statement Thursday saying the delegation to Brussels would present an addition to its 2004 progress report, focusing on measures taken during July and August.
The EU, in turn, is expected to issue its annual report on candidate countries during the fall.
EU Enlargement chief Guenter Verheugen says the preparations for reports on both Romania and Bulgaria are moving ahead.

ATHENS, Greece -- The navy on Monday (2 May) sent a frigate, a helicopter and a Special Forces team to investigate reports that pirates had attacked a Norwegian ship in Greek waters.
The vessel was escorted to a port.
However, authorities eventually discovered that the report had been "a misunderstanding" involving a cable sent by the captain.
The ship was carrying cement from Turkey to Italy.

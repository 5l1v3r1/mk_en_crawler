BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Federal Customs chief Mihalj Kertes was sentenced on Monday (December 27th) to eight years in prison for abuse of office.
A court in Belgrade convicted him of transferring millions of dollars from the state budget to accounts in Cyprus during the UN sanctions of the 1990s.
Kertes was acting under the orders of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the court said.
According to the indictment, the money was transferred to individuals, political parties and the State Security Service.
Kertes has the right to appeal.

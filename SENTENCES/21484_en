BELGRADE, Serbia -- Leaders of the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) gave the green light Sunday (May 25th) to a coalition with the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Serbian Democratic Party-New Serbia Alliance (DSS-NS) in the city of Belgrade. 
However, a final decision on the ruling coalition in the capital requires confirmation by the SPS's office in Belgrade.
Also on Sunday, the SPS, which turned kingmaker after inconclusive May 11th parliamentary elections, met with its coalition partners -- the Pensioners' Party and United Serbia (JS) -- to discuss negotiations for the state-level government. 
The three parties agreed to ask the DSS-NS to further explain its position on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and to ask for additional guarantees of the implementation of a programme on social justice and higher pensions. 
JS leader Dragan Markovic told B92 that his party's three members of parliament would support ratification of the SAA, something both the SRS and the DSS-NS oppose. 
Without JS backing, an SRS-DSS-NS-SPS coalition cannot be formed.

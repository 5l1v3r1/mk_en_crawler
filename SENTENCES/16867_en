STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a report Monday (4 September) on Turkey.
The document criticises the slowdown of reforms in the EU candidate country, and its failure to act in line with its pledges and pre-accession commitments.
The report cited delays in reforms related to politics, law enforcement, freedom of expression, religious and minority rights and women's rights.
The panel voiced support for Turkey's eventual membership but cautioned that the country must drastically step up efforts to fulfil the set criteria.

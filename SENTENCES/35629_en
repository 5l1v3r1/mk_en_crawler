KONYA, Turkey -- The death toll from a collapsed 11-story building in Konya has risen to 51, local media reported Friday (6 February).
The last known survivors were pulled from the rubble Tuesday.
As many as 60 people are still missing.
Inspectors meanwhile were collecting samples from the building, amid reports that shoddy construction and materials caused the tragedy.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the site Thursday, said the government would prosecute the contractors.
In other news, UEFA, the European soccer governing body, announced Thursday that the 2005 final of the European Champions Cup will be held at Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul.
This would be the highest profile sporting event ever staged in the country.

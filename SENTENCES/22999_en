TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament on Monday (November 3rd) discussed a motion filed by the opposition regarding Prime Minister Sali Berisha's alleged connections to Bosnian businessman Damir Fazlic.
Prosecutors have been investigating Fazlic for illegal financial activity and improper business relations with government officials, including Berisha.
In his speech to lawmakers, Berisha said the only reason for the opposition's motion is its effort to undermine the government's achievements over the past three years.
In other news Monday, the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), Albania's second biggest opposition party, said it intends to block an agreement on the new Election Code.
SMI leader Ilir Meta said the draft agreement excludes the party from the Central Election Commission.
He slammed the draft as "an attack on democracy" by the two main parties, the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party.

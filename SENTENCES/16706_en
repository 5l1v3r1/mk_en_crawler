VIENNA, Austria -- Talks on Kosovo's future status resumed in Vienna on Monday (7 August) between delegations from Belgrade and Pristina.
The focus this round is on decentralisation and minority rights.
The international community is urging both sides to resolve the province's long-term political status by the end of this year.
Decentralisation has been already discussed by the delegations in past sessions, without reaching agreement.

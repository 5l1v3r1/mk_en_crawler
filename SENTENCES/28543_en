TIRANA, Albania -- More than 8,000 tonnes of old munitions that don't meet NATO standards have been destroyed this year, Defence Minister Arben Imami was quoted as saying on Sunday (July 11th).
The dismantling was done by special teams at several secured locations in the country.
Imami estimates Albania still has around 90,000 tonnes of such munitions.
The dismantling process should be completed by 2013 and is expected to cost around 35m euros, which will be secured mainly through donations.

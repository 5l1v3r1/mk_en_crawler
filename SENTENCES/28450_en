TIRANA, Albania -- A delegation of EU experts will be arriving in Tirana soon to evaluate efforts to join the bloc's visa-free travel regime, the European Commission office in Albania confirmed on Monday (July 12th). 
No official schedule for the visit has been set. 
The delegation will be determining whether local authorities are exerting enough effort in the areas of law enforcement, fighting crime and corruption and confiscating criminal assets. 
The findings will be considered in the drafting of the final decision on Albania's and Bosnia and Herzegovina's readiness to join the visa-free regime, expected by October.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The justice ministry explicitly rejected on Monday (14 August) allegations of corruption in the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to foreigners.
At a news conference, Deputy Minister of Justice Ana Karaivanova stressed that citizenship is awarded only after thorough background checks.
She dismissed as "ill-intended" a report by the British Sunday Times implying that for a price, Bulgaria was granting citizenship to foreigners anxious for entry in the EU labour market.

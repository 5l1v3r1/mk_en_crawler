BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Russian Ambassador to Sarajevo Aleksander Bocan-Harchenko said Wednesday (January 27th) that the time has come to close the Office of High Representative (OHR). 
After meeting with Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic in Banja Luka, Bocan-Harchenko said that the high representative's powers have become part of the problem instead of a key to resolving them. 
Radojcic said his talks with Bocan-Harchenko focused on meeting five objectives and two conditions set by the Peace Implementation Council for the OHR to transition into an EU Special Representative office. 
RS officials, led by Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, routinely criticise decisions by the OHR.

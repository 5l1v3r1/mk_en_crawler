BUCHAREST, Romania -- A Bucharest court sentenced in absentia Syrian businessman Omar Hayssam to 20 years in prison for terrorism Wednesday (June 13th). 
Hayssam was convicted of having orchestrated the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists -- Ovidiu Ohanesian, Marie Jeanne Ion and Sorin Miscoci -- in Iraq in 2005. 
The judges also decided that Hayssam should pay 2m euros worth of compensation to each of the three. 
Hayssam left Romanian custody last year, triggering a scandal that prompted all heads of the intelligence services to resign.

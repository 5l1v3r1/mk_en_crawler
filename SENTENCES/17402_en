TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Tripoli regional court postponed on Wednesday (June 27th) the hearing of a new slander lawsuit, filed by a Libyan police officer against five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor currently on death row. 
The case will be heard on July 18th. 
In late May, the six medics were acquitted of similar charges. 
At issue are claims that officers tortured them into confessing to deliberately infecting children at a Benghazi hospital with HIV. 
On July 11th, the Libyan Supreme Court is expected to rule on a final appeal of the death sentences handed down in that case.

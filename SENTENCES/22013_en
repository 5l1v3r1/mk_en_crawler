BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) has decided to press charges against Romania and Bulgaria at the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over problems in implementing the EU-wide emergency number 112, EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media Viviane Reding announced on Thursday (September 18th).
The EC will give the two countries no more than three additional months to resolve the issues.
Initially, the deadline for introducing the number was January 2007, when the two countries joined the bloc.
The EC decided to start infringement procedures against Romania last December, because the EU-wide emergency number did not function properly.
Romanian authorities still have difficulty identifying the caller if the person in need uses a mobile phone.
Bulgaria's problem is failing to guarantee the number functions everywhere in the country.
The EC launched infringement procedures against Bulgaria nearly a year ago.
EU legislation obliges all member states to provide free access to emergency services to those who dial 112.

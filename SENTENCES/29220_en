PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Institutions in charge of security in Kosovo announced on Tuesday (October 5th) they are committed to expanding the rule of law in the Serb-dominated north.
The heads of KFOR, EULEX Police and Kosovo Police announced a plan, implemented Monday, to put the area under control.
"We undertook security measures, with additional patrols and increased number of [Italian] carabineers that are intended to prevent unrest and establish order and law," KFOR Commander Erhard Buehler told a joint press conference.
The head of EULEX Police, Udo Karl-Heinz Moeller, confirmed that the mission will press charges against those involved in criminal activities.
Kosovo Police Director Behar Selimi promised to reward policemen who demonstrate results and discipline those who under-perform.
Media reports suggest the increased presence in the north is a precursor to EULEX moves to arrest the so-called "big fish" among crime bosses in the north.

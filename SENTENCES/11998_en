THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN war crimes prosecutors have asked the tribunal president and chambers to merge procedures and schedule a single trial for all nine people indicted for the Srebrenica massacre, according to an announcement Wednesday (15 June).
Nine former Bosnian Serb army officers -- Drago Nikolic, Ljubisa Beara, Ljubomir Borovcanin, Milan Gvero, Milorad Trbic, Radivoje Miletic, Vinko Pandurevic, Vujadin Popovic and Zdravko Tolimir -- face charges stemming from the murders of some 8,000 Srebrenica Muslims in July 1995.
Eight of the accused are in custody in The Hague;
only Tolimir is still on the run.
In other news, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte and Theodor Meron, the president of the UN war crimes tribunal, are due to meet US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Washington, a court spokeswoman announced Wednesday.
The meeting is expected to focus on the hunt for Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, as well as the timetable for closing the international tribunal.

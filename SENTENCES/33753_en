SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Parliament voted Friday (28 November) to extend the country's six-month military mission in Iraq, which is due to expire 10 December. 
In line with a proposal by the defence ministry, the new contingent would leave for Baghdad on 3 December and would consist of 31 soldiers, one liaison officer, two senior army officers and a nine-member medical team. 
The troops would remain in Iraq for six months. 
Macedonia's involvement in the international peacekeeping operation would significantly contribute to its aspirations to become a NATO member, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Diyarbakir pressed charges on Friday (December 25th) against 23 Kurdish officials over their alleged links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
The group includes eight mayors and prominent Kurdish activist Hatip Dicle, a former lawmaker who has served ten years in prison for PKK membership. 
These 23 people are part of a bigger group of 36 who security forces arrested early Thursday as part of a large-scale operation in several Kurd-dominated regions in southeast Turkey. 
The operation, the third of the year, was carried out amid the government's ongoing investigation against PKK separatists and the recently outlawed Democratic Society Party (DTP). 
The Supreme Court banned the party for its suspected links to the PKK two weeks ago.
Friday's arrests touched off protests Saturday when the police and Kurdish demonstrators clashed in the Kurd-dominated cities of Yuksekova and Cizre, near the border with Iraq. 
No injuries were reported. 
There was a peaceful protest in Diyarbakir.
Meanwhile, the Peace and Democracy Party -- the new political entity that replaces the DTP -- has formally applied to establish a new parliamentary group. 
It includes 19 former DTP lawmakers, plus Ufuk Uras, an independent.

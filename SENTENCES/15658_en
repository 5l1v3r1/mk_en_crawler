LIPLJAN, Kosovo, Serbia -- Serb residents in several central Kosovo municipalities complained on Monday (October 23rd) about continued restrictions on power supplies, accusing the Kosovo Albanian authorities and the province's power utility KEK of discrimination.
Lipljan Deputy Mayor Borivoje Vignjevic says electricity supplies to Serb villages in the municipality, as well as the Strpce municipality, is being cut for up to 20 hours a day, while temperatures fall.
The Red Cross in the Strpce municipality warns of a potential humanitarian crisis if the issue is not resolved quickly.

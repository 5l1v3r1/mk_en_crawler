HEILIGENDAMM, Germany -- The major Western powers have agreed to delay a vote on a resolution on the future status of Kosovo, international media reported on Thursday (June 7th).
Speaking to reporters at the G8 summit in Germany, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he had proposed a delay of six months during which Belgrade and Pristina would have an opportunity to negotiate a better deal.
If they fail to do so, the plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari would be put to a vote in the Security Council.
Sarkozy said the delay was due to Russia threatening to veto the resolution at the Security Council.
Separately Thursday, ethnic Albanian politician Veton Surroi urged the West to proceed with the vote on Ahtisaari's plan.
"I don't think we should be held hostage to the threat of a veto," he said.
Surroi said Kosovo would declare independence if Russia blocks the resolution.

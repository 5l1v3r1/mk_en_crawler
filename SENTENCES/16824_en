SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry Thursday (October 5th) accused former deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska and former prime minister -- now President-- Branko Crvenkovski, of abuse of office in connection with a deal signed with Microsoft Corporation three years ago.
Ministry officials say the contract resulted in significant losses to the state budget.
They have forwarded the case to state prosecutors.
The interior ministry also claims large amounts of foreign aid were misappropriated, particularly USAID and EU assistance.
Crvenkovski's press office dismissed the accusations as a "political pamphlet".
The US, EU and British embassies in Skopje also issued statements rejecting the allegations.

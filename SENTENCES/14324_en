BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers were due to meet on Monday (12 December) to examine the Union's plans for enlargement. 
A possible decision to grant Macedonia the status of membership candidate is also on the agenda. 
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is expected to urge the ministers to keep the enlargement process going despite scepticism in a number of countries and a budget row that threatens to paralyse the Union. 
A formal decision about Macedonia will be made at the meeting of EU leaders later this week.
Also Monday, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski travels to Israel. 
He is marking the 10th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties.

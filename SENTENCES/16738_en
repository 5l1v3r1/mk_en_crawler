BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's special war crimes court on Wednesday (6 September) sentenced former Yugoslav Army volunteer Sasa Radak to 20 years in prison, for war crimes in Ovcara, Croatia, in 1991.
Radak received the maximum sentence possible under Serbian law for taking part in the murders of 192 Croats at a pig farm.
The victims were taken from a local hospital and executed by rebel Serbs.
Radak insisted throughout the trial that he was innocent.
The same court in December sentenced 14 others to prison for the crimes.
Also on Wednesday, a new judge was appointed to preside over the trial of those accused of assassinating Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Nata Mesarovic, a member of the three-judge panel since the beginning of the hearings, will take over from Goran Kljajevic, who resigned last week.
Local media reports suggest he had been pressured by the defence to slow the pace of the proceedings.
The trial has dragged on for three years.

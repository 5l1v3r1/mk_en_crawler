THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Authorities transferred convicted war criminal Haradin Balaj, a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), to a prison in France on Thursday (May 15th) to serve the rest of his sentence.
France is one of 15 European countries that signed deals with the tribunal to house convicts.
Balaj received a sentence in November 2005 of 13 years for the torture, abuse and murder of Serb and Albanian civilians in a KLA prisoner-of-war camp in Lapusnik between May and June 1998.
He was a guard there at the time.

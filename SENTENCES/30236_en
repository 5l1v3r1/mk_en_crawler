PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic is urging the heads of Serbian police structures and commanders of Serb territorial defence in Kosovo to "consolidate", media reported on Monday (December 20th).
The Pristina-based daily Koha Ditore says that Dacic visited Zvecan for a few hours on Sunday where he met with members of Serb parallel structures.
The structures should consolidate in order to prevent the expansion of Pristina institutions in northern Mitrovica and northern Kosovo, a source quoted Dacic as saying.
Dacic entered Kosovo from the northern crossing points with Serbia.
Kosovo police said they had no information about his arrival.
Belgrade-based media say Dacic attended an early screening of a movie at the cultural centre in Zvecan.

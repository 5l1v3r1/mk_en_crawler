MADRID, Spain -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, his Romanian counterpart, Mircea Geoana, and the foreign ministers of the five other NATO invitees attended a working luncheon with NATO diplomacy chiefs in Madrid Tuesday (3 June). 
The meeting, the first to be held in this format, took place in light of the Alliance's expected expansion this year. 
In all, seven new members -- Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- are set to join NATO. 
The talks focused on the international political situation and NATO's transformation to meet new security threats.
In other news, the Hungarian Parliament ratified the NATO accession protocols for the seven candidate countries Tuesday. 
The documents have already been approved by the legislatures of six NATO member states, and the approval of the German Bundestag is expected later this week.

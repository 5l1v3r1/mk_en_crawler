SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev won re-election Sunday (October 18th) as chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), grabbing about 60% of delegates' votes at a party congress.
There were three other candidates for the post.
The vote followed the BSP's poor showing in the July general elections.
Stanishev became leader of the party in 2001.

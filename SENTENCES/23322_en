PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Thousands of Serbs turned out on Sunday (June 28th) to celebrate the 620th anniversary of the Kosovo battle in which the Serb Army confronted the invading Ottoman Turks. 
Police say there were no incidents, though celebrations included nationalistic songs and slogans. 
Three ministers from Serbia attended the Vidovdan (St. 
Vitus Day) liturgy, as well as Princess Katarina and Prince Alexander II Karadjordjevic, who urged displaced Serbs to return to Kosovo. 
Vidovdan celebrations began with prayers at the Gracanica church, where Serb Orthodox leaders denounced Kosovo's independence from Serbia.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- OSCE Secretary-General Marc Perrin de Brichambaut met with heads of the Kosovo parliamentary caucuses on Tuesday (July 24th) in Pristina. 
He assured them that Kosovo institutions would receive OSCE support even after the final status of the province is resolved.
In other news, Torbjorn Sohlstrom, EU security chief Javier Solana's special envoy to Kosovo, told the BBC on Tuesday he believes the final status will ultimately be resolved by the UN Security Council, though the matter moved to the Contact Group last week. 
Sohlstrom says Kosovo's status should be settled through a process that has full legitimacy and the support of the international community.

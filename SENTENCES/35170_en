ZAGREB, Croatia -- The newspaper <I>Jutarnji List</I> reported Monday (23 February) that elements of the country's security services are helping war crimes fugitive General Ante Gotovina evade justice.
Quoting a statement by an unidentified minister, the paper says that the new government plans to replace the officers working on the former general's case.
The UN tribunal in The Hague charged Gotovina with the murders of 150 Serbs during a military operation in 1995.
The retired general went into hiding when his indictment was announced in 2001.
Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte accuses Croatia of not doing enough to arrest him.

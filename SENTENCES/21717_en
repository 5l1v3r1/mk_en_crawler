TIRANA, Albania -- Leaders of the opposition Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) on Tuesday (August 19th) criticised Prime Minister Sali Berisha for failing to produce promised election reform. 
"Berisha is lying about the progress of the election reform and has the irresponsibility to question the future process of parliamentary elections," SMI leader Ilir Meta said. 
According to the SMI's deputy head, Pellumb Xhufi, Berisha had promised that the election reform process would wrap up before last April's NATO summit in Bucharest, yet it remains a work in progress. 
Xhufi also criticised the biggest opposition Socialist Party for co-operating with the ruling Democratic Party in the effort.

MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Serb entity in BiH does not co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal, according to the latest Human Rights Watch (HRW) report on BiH, which noted not a single war crime has been prosecuted to date. 
HRW also cited the attempt by the Serb entity's Office for Co-operation with The Hague tribunal to falsify the number of victims in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
The report cites a large number of incidents against those returning to pre-war homes, though it also says minority returns during the first eight months of 2002 were 30 per cent higher than during the same period in 2001.

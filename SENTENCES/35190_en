TIRANA, Albania -- The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) called on President Alfred Moisiu Sunday (22 February) to exercise his constitutional powers and dismiss the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
DP leader Sali Berisha, who had previously criticised Moisiu for the "destruction of the electoral process" in the country, now says the head of state is not "the real problem".
Moisiu meanwhile praised the peaceful nature of opposition protests on Saturday, in contrast to a violent protest against Nano two weeks ago.
In other news, an Albanian delegation traveled to Athens at the weekend, discussing Euro-Atlantic integration with Greek counterparts.
The Greek delegation urged Albania to ensure political stability in the country, as a precondition to completing reforms crucial to EU entry.

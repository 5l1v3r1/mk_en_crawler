ANKARA, Turkey -- As expected, Turkey lifted emergency law restrictions in two provinces Saturday (30 November), 15 years after they were imposed. 
Diyarbakir and Sirnak were the last of 13 regions placed under special rule in 1987 amid fighting between the authorities and Kurdish separatists. 
The EU has been calling for move, which comes just two weeks before the Copenhagen summit where Turkey hopes to be invited to start accession talks.
In other news, two more prisoners who staged a hunger strike over conditions in Turkey's maximum-security prisons died at the weekend. 
That makes 61 inmate deaths since the hunger strike began in 2000.

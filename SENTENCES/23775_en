TIRANA, Albania -- The government plans to target less developed regions of the country, particularly in the northeast and southeast, to help low income residents there. 
At a meeting Wednesday (July 22nd), Prime Minister Sali Berisha instructed his cabinet to prepare a package of assistance measures within a month, aimed at alleviating poverty through employment. 
"We will give no-interest loans to motivate farmers," said Berisha, adding that one main tool to fighting poverty is strengthening education and getting children back in school.

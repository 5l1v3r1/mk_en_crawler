PRISTINA, Kosovo -- President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Sunday (August 31st) he is not concerned by Belgrade's initiative to question the legality of Kosovo's unilaterally declared independence before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
"I am not worried about the case at the ICJ.
We have used our right to be an independent country in compliance with international standards," Sejdiu said.
Dismissing the initiative as a continuation of Belgrade's rhetoric, Sejdiu said no country with common sense will support such a move.
In August, Serbia formally submitted a request to the UN General Assembly for an advisory ruling by the ICJ on the legality of Kosovo's independence.

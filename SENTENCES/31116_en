VIENNA, Austria -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, currently in detention in Salzburg, again denied accusations of money laundering on Friday (February 4th).
Sanader was questioned by Austrian anti-corruption prosecutors for more than five hours.
A Tyrolean bank filed a report last December claiming there are 1.3 m euros in Sanader's bank account and the account of one of his family members.
Sanader's Austrian attorney Werner Suppan said that his client earned the money as a businessman prior to his engagement in politics.
Sanader was arrested on December 10th in Austria based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR troops continue searching intensely for war crimes indictees in BiH, EUFOR said in a statement Monday (9 May), in response to a report that appeared in the British newspaper The Guardian. 
It claimed that one of the UN war crimes tribunal's most-wanted indictees, Radovan Karadzic, was seen twice -- once in southeast BiH and once in Serbia -- in the past 20 days. 
It also quoted chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte as saying that war crimes prosecutors notified Serbian authorities of the sightings.
For his part, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic said Monday that the entity government had received no information from the tribunal or Belgrade about Karadzic's movements. 
Bukejlovic insisted that Bosnian Serb police would arrest Karadzic if he were on entity territory.

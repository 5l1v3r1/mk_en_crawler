BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament established a joint committee on constitutional reform Tuesday (April 20th) amid efforts by President Traian Basescu to turn the bicameral legislature into a unicameral one, reducing the number of lawmakers from 471 to 300. 
The Liberal Democratic Party is the only party that supports all of Basescu's ideas. 
All other parties, including the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, a member of the ruling coalition, reject the idea of a unicameral parliament. 
Most parties support some reduction in the number of lawmakers. 
According to existing procedure, constitutional amendments require the approval of two-thirds of all parliament members, and must then be put to a legally binding referendum. 
In order to be valid, at least a 50% turnout is required.
In other news Tuesday, the Senate judicial committee amended the procedure for implementing Constitutional Court rulings, in ongoing cases. 
Up until now, when legislation was declared unconstitutional, trials were stopped if the matter affected the proceedings, thus derailing thousands of cases. 
Now, arguments related to questionable legislation will be revised, rather than throwing out the whole case.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- An EU monitoring team that will be sent to Croatia to assess co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal will hold its first meeting on 26 April, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said Thursday (24 March) during talks with his Slovene counterpart, Dimtrij Rupel.
Asselborn, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik, EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn will make up the team.
The opening of accession talks between Croatia and the EU were delayed earlier this month because of insufficient war crimes co-operation.
Asselborn said he hopes the talks will get under way by the end of June.
Separately Thursday, Croatian President Stipe Mesic met informally with Slovene counterpart Janez Drnovsek in Ljubljana.
Drnovsek emphasised that Slovenia is one of the strongest supporters of Croatia's EU bid.

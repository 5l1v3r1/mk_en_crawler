SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Although the situation in Macedonia remains fragile, representatives of the international community see no threat of destabilisation or a new crisis. 
At a joint news conference Wednesday (18 June), spokesmen for the OSCE, NATO, the EU and its peacekeeping force Concordia praised the efforts of state institutions to maintain peace and foster stability. 
OSCE spokesman Wolfgang Greven said government efforts should target economic improvement, calling it the only way to avert another crisis.
In other news, Germany announced on Wednesday that it plans to pull out its remaining 50 troops deployed with Concordia and wrap up its mission there by year's end. 
It contributed 500 troops to NATO's original mission, Essential Harvest.

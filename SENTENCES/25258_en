ANKARA, Turkey -- Media conglomerate Dogan Yayin announced on Monday (September 28th) that authorities have raised the amount of a fine it was given for tax evasion. 
The fine, levied on September 8th, originally amounted to a record $2.5 billion, for unpaid taxes from the period 2005-2007. 
A company official told Reuters on Monday that due to interest and penalties, the fine has been increased by 29%, to $3.22 billion and may rise further. 
Dogan, which controls more than half of Turkey's private media market, has said that the fine is politically motivated. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has criticised the way Dogan's media outlets cover his government's policies.

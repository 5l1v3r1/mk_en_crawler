SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Skopje Basic Court sentenced in absentia Wednesday (January 3rd) former ethnic Albanian paramilitary leader Agim Krasniqi and his associate Sehat Ramadani to 18 months in prison for kidnapping and threatening public order. 
A third defendant, Kemal Sali, received a sentence of six months, again in absentia. 
Krasniqi is the notorious leader of an armed group that occupied and controlled the village of Kondovo between 2003 and 2004. 
He, Ramadani and Sali were found guilty of kidnapping a fellow ethnic Albanian, Seval Muaremi, for ransom in October 2003. 
Krasniqi faces a separate trial for terrorism, stemming from the siege of Kondovo and threats to shell Skopje.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Two people died and a third was injured by an oil pipeline explosion in southeast Turkey late Tuesday (August 10th).
The BBC says the victims were in two cars passing the scene when a remote-controlled bomb triggered the blast.
Security sources say it happened in a section of the pipeline near the town of Midyat, in Mardin province.
But other reports say it happened in Sirnak province, bordering Iraq and Syria.
According to local media, authorities suspect the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Oil flow has been stopped as firefighters battle the flames.
The pipeline carries oil from Kirkuk -- in northern Iraq -- to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The leader of the nationalist World Macedonian Congress, Todor Petrov, submitted to parliament on Wednesday (1 September) the 180,454 signatures collected in support of a referendum on the new decentralisation laws. 
The ruling coalition opposes the idea, saying such a referendum could lead to ethnic tensions. 
Parliament is expected to discuss the issue next week.
In other news, as scheduled Wednesday, Macedonia's police formally assumed responsibility for controlling the countryâ€™s eastern border with Bulgaria. 
The OSCE praised the handover from the defence ministry, saying it indicates Macedonia is "getting closer to Euro-Atlantic integration".

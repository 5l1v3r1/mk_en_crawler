ANKARA, Turkey -- A court on Thursday (May 29th) banned the only gay rights association in Istanbul and the biggest one in the country, arguing that it harms public morality. 
LambdaIstanbul announced it would appeal and would involve the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. 
LambdaIstanbul was established in 1993 and became an association in 2006. 
It will be the first gay association in an EU candidate country to suffer a ban. 
Though Turkey permits homosexuality, it has no laws protecting gays from discrimination.

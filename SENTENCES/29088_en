ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said on Monday (July 5th) that the army will continue its operations against suspected bases of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), including in northern Iraq, to prevent them from attacking Turkey's security forces in southeast Anatolia.
"We are determined to deal with the terrorists and our military operations in northern Iraq will continue as long as necessary," Cicek said.
Meanwhile, local media reported on Tuesday that Kurdish rebels killed three Turkish soldiers and injured three others in an attack on a military post in the Hakkari province, near the Iraqi border.
In a separate attack, media reported that five Turkish soldiers were injured Monday in the town of Aricak, in eastern Elazig province, by a group of PKK personnel who opened fire on them.
Earlier Monday, two soldiers were wounded by a landmine in Hakkari province.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The European Commission has submitted 36 recommendations on implementing Macedonia's action plan for EU integration, government spokesman Saso Colakovski said Monday (28 July). 
Most of the recommendations, submitted during a meeting of the EU-Macedonia Co-operation Council in Brussels on Friday, are related to the political situation and implementation of reforms. 
Only five concern economic issues. 
European officials acknowledged progress in regards to the security situation, but insisted more needs be done to fight organised crime and corruption.

CHICAGO, United States -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan says the main issues hampering strategic relations between Turkey and the US are Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists in Iraq and a resolution pending in the US Congress about Armenian genocide claims.
Speaking to the Chicago Council of Global Affairs on Thursday (September 20th), during an official visit to the US, Babacan said Turkish authorities cannot explain to the public why PKK militants are still launching attacks against the country from bases in northern Iraq.
Turkish media reports Saturday quoted him as saying Turkey expects both the US and Iraq to take appropriate measures.
As for Armenian claims of genocide by Ottoman Turks in the beginning of the 20th century, which the US administration is being urged to recognise in two pending resolutions, Babacan said no third party should act as judge in such a dispute.
In other news, Turkish security forces on Friday caught a leading member of the Hizbollah military wing in Turkey, who had been sought for 13 years.
Mehmet Akay, 36, is believed to have been involved in a series of terrorist attacks, mostly in the southeastern Mardin province between 1993 and 1995.
On Saturday meanwhile, nine Kurdish militants were killed in a series of clashes with the army in southeast Turkey.
One was in Hakkari province;
the others were in the border province of Sirnak.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government has offered a reward of 1m euros for information leading to the arrest of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic.
Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said on Friday (October 12th) that the offer did not mean that the fugitive is necessarily hiding in Serbia.
Rather, he said, it demonstrates Belgrade's commitment to bringing the remaining war crimes suspects to justice.
Mladic's arrest is a condition Serbia must meet to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU -- the first step towards EU accession negotiations.
On Monday, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte will report on Belgrade's level of co-operation with The Hague, during the EU's Council of Ministers in Luxembourg.
Rasim Ljajic, the Serbian official in charge of co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said rewards of 250,000 euros each have also been offered for the arrest of former Bosnian Serb police commander Stojan Zupljanin and Goran Hadzic, a wartime leader of the Serb separatists in Croatia.
Ljajic explained that no reward is offered for Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic, as he is not a Serbian citizen.

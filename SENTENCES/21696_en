BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors announced indictments Monday (April 21st) against four former members of the paramilitary Scorpions unit in connection with the 1999 Podujevo massacre in Kosovo.
Zeljko Dukic, Dragan Medic, Dragan Bojevic and Miodrag Solaj -- members of the unit that operated under the supervision of the interior ministry -- are accused of shooting at a group of 19 women and children from the Gashi family in the Podujevo village on March 28th 1999.
Only five children survived the massacre, rescued by Serbian special police units who arrived at the scene.
A fifth Scorpions member, Sasa Cvjetan, is serving a 20-year prison term for the massacre.

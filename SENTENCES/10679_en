BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana said Friday (8 October) that conditions set by Serbian President Boris Tadic regarding Kosovo Serbs' participation in the 23 October parliamentary elections are completely "realistic". 
In an interview with B92, Solana said these conditions are achievable within three months -- a deadline set in a public address given by Tadic last week -- but should have been realised long ago. 
A key condition is establishment of Serb-led local government bodies in all Serb-populated areas in Kosovo. 
Solana added that Serb participation in the vote would be the best option for Kosovo, Serbia and the EU.

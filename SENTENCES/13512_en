BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Interpol said Friday (24 March) that it has cancelled an international arrest warrant for former Kosovo Liberation Army commander Agim Ceku, following his election as Kosovo prime minister. 
The warrant was issued at the request of Serbia, which accuses Ceku of war crimes.
In Belgrade, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic criticised Interpol's move and termed it invalid. 
According to the minister, only the court that issued the arrest warrant four years ago has the authority to cancel it. 
Therefore, he said, legal proceedings against Ceku remain in force in Serbia.

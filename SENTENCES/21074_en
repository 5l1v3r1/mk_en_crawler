SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The defence ministry is drafting a measure to freeze the assets of four high profile fugitives still sought by the UN war crimes tribunal, Dnevni Avaz reported on Saturday (September 1st).
The law on supporting the mandate of the tribunal would allow the move, as it makes providing assistance to such fugitives a criminal offence and entitles prosecutors to freeze assets in the course of investigations.
The measure will be applied to the assets of Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic, Stojan Zupljanin and Goran Hadzic.
Less than a week ago, Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian insisted that only by freezing the assets of fugitives would their arrests be possible.

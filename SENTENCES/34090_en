BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Meeting on Monday (21 July), the EU foreign ministers gave a thumbs-up to starting the process of EU entry for Serbia-Montenegro.
The first step would be to launch a feasibility study on the country's preparations for opening Stabilisation and Association talks.
Economic harmonisation between Serbia and Montenegro is key, officials said.
Parliaments of each republic have approved the Action Plan on hamonisation;
the federal legislature is expected to do so shortly.

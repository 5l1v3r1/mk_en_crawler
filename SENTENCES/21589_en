SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Hundreds of farmers blocked one of the main roads in the country Thursday (August 21st) to protest the delayed payment of state subsidies. 
More than 300 dairy producers and cattle breeders stopped traffic through the Shipka Pass connecting northern and southern Bulgaria. 
After minor clashes with police, the protest ended and the pass reopened. 
Romanian farmers from the Association of Stock Breeders supported their Bulgarian counterparts.

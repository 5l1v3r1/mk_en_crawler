PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Chief State Prosecutor Vesna Medenic and Croatian counterpart Mladen Bajic were to endorse an accord Friday (28 July) on co-operation in prosecuting war crimes suspects from the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
Podgorica is agreeing to press charges against Montenegrin nationals accused of war crimes in Croatia but beyond the reach of Croatia's judiciary.
In other news, the Montenegrin parliament approved an amendment Thursday to the elections law.
It gives the Albanian minority in the country five guaranteed seats in parliament, rather than four.

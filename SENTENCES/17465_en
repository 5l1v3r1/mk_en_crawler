PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR is determined to stop Serb paramilitaries from attending a commemoration of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo on Thursday (June 29th).
"Should they come in, it should be very clear it is our mission to immediately intervene and we will do so," German General Roland Kather, the commander of the peacekeepers, said in a radio interview on Tuesday.
Dozens of members of a militia called 'Tsar Lazar's Guard" reportedly have entered Kosovo to take part in the event.
An ethnic Albanian extremist organisation, the Albanian National Army, has threatened to meet Guard members in Kosovo "with bullets".
In other news Tuesday, a senior US congressman said Washington and its allies would recognise Kosovo as an independent state.
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos, a Democrat, told visiting Russian deputies that the Kosovo issue will be resolved either by a UN Security Council resolution or via a unilateral declaration of independence by the Kosovo Parliament.

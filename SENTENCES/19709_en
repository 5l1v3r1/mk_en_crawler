ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul praised on Wednesday (November 21st) steps taken by Iraqi Kurdish authorities to curb operations by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), saying common sense has finally begun to prevail in Iraq. 
According to Gul, the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq are aware of the price their country would pay if it does not stand up against the PKK. 
Turkey has moved more than 100,000 troops to its borders with Iraq and parliament has authorised the government to launch a cross-border military operation. 
Gul made the comments in Tbilisi, where he attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a new railway linking Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
Cemil Bayik, a senior PKK commander, issued a statement of his own Wednesday, vowing the militants would destabilise Iraqi Kurdistan if its government sides with Turkey.

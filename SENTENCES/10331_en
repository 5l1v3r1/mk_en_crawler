STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament has started discussing the progress reports on Bulgaria and Romania's EU membership negotiations. 
The body is split over recent proposals to separate the accession bids of the two countries, media sources said Wednesday (24 November). 
The debate stems from the draft papers presented by the two rapporteurs -- Geoffrey Van Orden for Bulgaria and Pierre Moscovici for Romania. 
According to Van Orden, Sofia is proceeding towards EU entry according to schedule, while Bucharest lags behind. 
Moscovici's report, meanwhile, described Romania as being in a "fragile balance". 
He noted that unless unresolved problems such as press freedom, justice, corruption and poverty are tackled, EU entry might be delayed two years beyond the scheduled date of 2007. 
Under one scenario, Bulgaria, having already closed the negotiation talks with the EU, could be invited to sign the EU Accession Treaty in May 2005, regardless of Romania's situation.

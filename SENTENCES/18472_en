BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Belgrade regional court said on Wednesday (May 9th) that a letter has been received containing threats against Judge Nata Mesarevic, who is presiding in Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination trial. 
Reportedly sent from Chicago, it contained insults against both Djindjic and Mesarevic, and was signed by a group calling itself "Organisation for Protection of Serbs". 
The Interior Ministry is pursuing the matter.
In other news Wednesday, Belgrade regional prosecutors went to the Supreme Court to appeal sentences handed down in February in the so-called Ibar Highway case. 
Four Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) officials were murdered in 1999 and SPO president and then-leader of the Serbian opposition, Vuk Draskovic, narrowly avoided assassination. 
The Belgrade regional court sentenced former Special Police unit chief Milorad Ulemek, also known as "Legija", to 15 years. 
The prosecutors are demanding the maximum 40 years instead.

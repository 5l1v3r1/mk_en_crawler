ZAGREB, Croatia -- The national television network reported Thursday (4 March) that the UN war crimes tribunal has indicted two retired generals, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac.
Though there is no official confirmation, the network says the generals received court papers last week.
The two men, who had been interviewed by the tribunal's investigators, have told the local media that they would surrender to The Hague if charged.
They are accused of taking part in atrocities against Serbs when Croat forces recaptured the Knin area in 1995.
Cermak was the local civilian administrator, while Markac commanded special police units during an operation dubbed "Storm".

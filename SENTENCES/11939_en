TIRANA. 
Albania -- The Central Elections Commission (CEC) must be independent of party politics, said panel chief Ilirjan Celibashi on Thursday (14 April). 
He stressed that commission members must understand they are servants of the law and not political figures. 
To ensure that the general elections this summer are democratic, the commission has to maintain neutrality and objectivity, Celibashi added. 
He also urged the opposition Democrat Party to stop criticising the CEC.
In other news, prosecutor general Theodhori Sollaku rejected evidence presented against Prime Minister Fatos Nano to support claims he was involved in weapons trafficking. 
But Christian Democrat parliament member Nikolle Lesi insisted on Thursday that the claims against Nano are well-founded and the evidence is authentic.

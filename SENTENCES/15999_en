TIRANA, Albania -- The Association of Albanian Prosecutors issued a statement Monday (17 April), criticising the ruling Democratic Party and Prime Minister Sali Berisha for launching a campaign against chief prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku.
Berisha is demanding his dismissal, citing alleged links to organised crime.
The union, however, dismisses the allegations as politically motivated, and says they threaten to jeopardise public trust in the institution and the fight against crime.
By law, parliament can discharge the chief prosecutor over actions that violate the law or national interests.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Wednesday (12 May) approved the controversial bill on education reform that envisions easing restrictions for graduates of vocational religious schools to enter universities.
Last week, the military expressed its disapproval of the proposal.
The Office of the Chief of General Staff warned that the measure would harm the secular principles on which education in Turkey is based.
Despite that, parliamentary approval sends the bill on to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
He will either approve it or return it to parliament for further discussion.

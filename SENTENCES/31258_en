PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Friday (December 31st) that a recent Council of Europe report accusing him of involvement in illegal human organ trafficking activities may hamper future talks with Belgrade.
"It is an attack by [the report's author] Dick Marty against the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia," Thaci said in an interview with AFP, stressing the timing of the document coincided with the moment Belgrade and Pristina were about to begin "closing the chapter of darkness and opening the chapter of the future".
At the same time, he said he remains committed to meeting with Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic.

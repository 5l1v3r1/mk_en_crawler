BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry on Monday (September 29th) reported the liberation by Egyptian and Sudanese forces -- with the help of European commandos -- of Romanian national Irina Oana Kalis, who was abducted in Egypt more than a week ago.
She is in good condition.
Gunmen seized Kalis, together with ten other European tourists and eight Egyptians, in a remote border area of Egypt.
Authorities in Egypt, Sudan, Germany, Italy and Romania collaborated to win their release.
Egypt's defence ministry says Egyptian and Sudanese forces killed half of the kidnappers.

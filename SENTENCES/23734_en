BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has asked former UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari to help solve a border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia, media reported on Friday (January 23rd).
Rehn's spokesperson, Kristina Nagy, said the commissioner has asked Ahtisaari to lead a team of mediators to help settle the quarrel, which has become an obstacle in Croatia's bid to join the EU.
She added that Croatia and Slovenia must first agree on the terms for negotiations before the group is created.
Nagy reiterated the European Commission's stance that finding a solution is not a prerequisite for Zagreb's accession.
Nevertheless, she said, the issue has become an EU problem.
In December, Ljubljana blocked Croatia's EU accession talks after it vetoed the closing of some of its negotiation chapters over the border dispute between the two countries.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- One of the men convicted of murdering Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in 2003 was found wounded in Zagreb's outskirts, local media reported on Tuesday (June 8th).
Sretko Kalinic, a member of the criminal gang Zemun Clan, has been on the run for seven years.
In 2007, he was found guilty of Djindjic's murder and sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison.
Authorities say Kalinic was shot by another Zemun member, Milos Simovic, who was also sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison.
Serbian Police Director Milorad Veljovic says Kalinic has undergone surgery and is expected to recover.
Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says Kalinic was carrying a fake Croatian passport.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic on Friday (12 November) urged war crimes suspects to surrender, arguing that failure to do so could have "very serious consequences for the status of Republika Srpska (RS)".
He was referring to Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte's upcoming report to the UN Security Council.
Cavic called on authorities to contact the relatives of all suspects in RS and seek agreements on voluntary surrender.
In other news, survivors of the Srebrenica massacre announced Friday that they would sue RS for 2 billion euros for the mental anguish they suffered during the war.
Munira Subasic, head of the Srebrenica Mothers Association, said the way was open for litigation following the Bosnian Serb government's official admission of the tragedy.

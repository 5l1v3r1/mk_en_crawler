TIRANA, Albania -- The national currency, the lek, has depreciated dramatically this week, losing ground to the euro.
The decline has caused panic in Tirana, where one euro changed hands for 142.5 leks on Thursday afternoon (September 24th), compared to a 2009 average of 125 leks per euro.
Albanian Central Bank Governor Ardian Fullani urged the public to stay calm Wednesday.
"What is happening has no economic basis.
The lek will continue to be our currency for many, many years," Fullani said.
Many people blame a comment Prime Minister Sali Berisha made last week -- that Albania "should surrender to the euro".
He said adopting the common European currency is an inevitable step in the EU integration process.

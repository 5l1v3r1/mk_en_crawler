BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic issued a statement Tuesday (31 January), acknowledging that the opposition Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and a new caucus within the RS legislature -- composed of minor opposition parties -- has a chance to form the new government. 
Cavic is consulting with various parties aimed at naming a new prime minister-designate, following the success of a no-confidence motion initiated by the SNSD last week.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Macedonia to demonstrate more concrete results from ongoing reforms Wednesday (October 3rd), especially in terms of the judiciary and the fight against corruption.
"Macedonia lost a lot of time in the 2006 election campaign, in the formation of the coalition and in domestic political battles," Rehn told a press conference after meeting with visiting Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski.
Rehn also warned that Brussels would not recommend the initiation of Macedonia's EU accession negotiations until the country has met the necessary conditions.
"We need concrete progress, and we need the words translated into concrete deeds," he said.
Macedonia received candidate status late in 2005 but no date has been set for launching actual accession talks.
The European Commission is due to issue a progress report on Macedonia next month.

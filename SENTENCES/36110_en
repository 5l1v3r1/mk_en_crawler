SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Living standards in Bulgaria remain low despite stable economic growth over the past couple of years, World Bank Country Manager for Bulgaria Oscar de Bruyn Kops said Wednesday (17 March), adding that not all Bulgarians have felt the benefits.
A World Bank analysis found significant pockets of poverty in rural areas and among ethnic minorities.
Based on these findings, the Bank will introduce more programmes for those segments of society to facilitate Bulgaria's EU accession.
In other news, the town of Kurdzhali will host a NATO exercise on civil emergency planning in response to a simulated terrorist attack on critical infrastructure facilities.
The exercise, scheduled for 31 May to 4 June, will be the first to be organised by Bulgaria as a NATO member.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Three lawmakers from Albanian's opposition Socialist Party (SP) who oppose the party's decision to boycott parliament met on Wednesday (January 27th) in Brussels with Eduard Kukan, the head of the EP delegation to the Balkans.
SP lawmaker Ben Blushi said that instead of boycotting parliamentary work, the SP should play a leading role in Albania's EU integration process.
His colleague Andis Harasani -- joined by fellow SP member Kastriot Islami -- said the party will soon return to parliament.
In Tirana, SP leader Edi Rama insisted that the boycott will continue until the June 2009 election process is investigated.

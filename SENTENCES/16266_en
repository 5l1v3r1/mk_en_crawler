BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers said on Monday (15 May) that talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia could still be wrapped up by the end of 2006 if Belgrade finds and arrests Ratko Mladic.
The EU's promise came less than two weeks after the European Commission put negotiations on hold, following Serbia's failure to produce the Bosnian Serb general by 30 April.
The SAA is considered the first step towards full EU membership.
Visiting Berlin on Monday, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reiterated that his government is doing all it can to find the fugitive, adding that Belgrade is committed to meeting all conditions for EU integration.
Kostunica also called for the preservation of the state union with Montenegro, ahead of next Sunday's independence referendum there.
Separately, the EU foreign ministers warned against outside attempts to influence the outcome.
They also denied reports that the EU is considering reductions to its peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.

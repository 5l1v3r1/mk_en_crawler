TIRANA, Albania -- A delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) arrives in Tirana on Monday (February 22nd) to help end the country's political stalemate.
President Bamir Topi is working to mediate talks between the government and the opposition, whose lawmakers have been boycotting parliament until an investigation is opened into the June 2009 general elections.
Members of the PACE delegation will meet with Topi, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli, Prime Minister Sali Berisha and other officials.

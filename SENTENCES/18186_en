BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Democratic Party (PD) demanded on Saturday (February 17th) that parliament members vote again on a no-confidence motion filed last week against Justice Minister Monica Macovei.
PD leader Emil Boc says 127 Senators registered to vote, but only 126 were present.
Bloc says a member of the opposition ultranationalist Greater Romania party voted twice.
The opposition accuses Macovei of failing to enact judicial reforms.

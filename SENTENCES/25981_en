SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The EU is optimistic about prospects for a compromise between Macedonia and Greece over their long-standing name dispute, even before EU foreign ministers meet on December 7th, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said on Tuesday (November 17th).
Bildt, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, said he is in constant contact with his counterparts in both countries and that both governments want to achieve progress.
Separately Tuesday, the UN mediator in the name dispute, Matthew Nimetz, said he will convene a new round of talks "if and when" he believes such a meeting will be useful.

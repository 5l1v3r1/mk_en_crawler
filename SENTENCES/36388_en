SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The three parties of the ruling coalition -- the Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia, the Democratic Union for Integration and the Liberal Democratic Party -- discussed measures Tuesday (18 May) to make the new cabinet more efficient. 
Prime Minister-designate Hari Kostov is expected to announce the composition of the new cabinet within weeks. 
The coalition parties say the government's main priority will be the power decentralisation package.
In other news Tuesday, police recovered four bodies from a 50m-deep pit near the western town of Kicevo. 
The bodies are believed to be those of three ethnic Albanians and one Bulgarian citizen who have been missing since the country's 2001 military conflict. 
Police started the exhumation work a week ago after receiving an anonymous phone tip.

THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The former spokeswoman of The Hague war crimes tribunal (ICTY), Florence Hartmann, refused Friday (November 14th) to enter a plea in her contempt-of-court trial.
Judge Carmel Agius entered not-guilty pleas for her.
Hartmann allegedly disclosed confidential information from the trial of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in two separate books.
She faces a maximum seven years in prison and a 100,000-euro fine.

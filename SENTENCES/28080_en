SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos voiced optimism Tuesday (April 20th) that Macedonia may get a date for starting EU membership talks during Spain's presidency of the bloc, which ends on July 1st. 
At a press conference with his Macedonian counterpart Antonio Milososki in Skopje, Moratinos said Madrid will put all its energy into that goal. 
He predicted that this will be a good year for Macedonia's bid to join both the EU and NATO, as long as both Skopje and Athens work to resolve their longstanding name dispute.
From Skopje, Moratinos travelled to Belgrade, where he met with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic and visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. 
Afterwards, Moratinos said that one topic of the trilateral meeting was the June EU-Balkans summit in Sarajevo. 
Serbia boycotted last month's Balkan summit in Slovenia due to Kosovo's participation.

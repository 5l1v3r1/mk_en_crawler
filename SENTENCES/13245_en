SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The outgoing commander of NATO HQ in BiH, US Brigadier General Steven P. Schook, voiced optimism Monday (29 August) about the arrest and transfer to The Hague tribunal of fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
During a farewell news conference in Sarajevo, Schook said he expects the chapter on war crimes co-operation to be closed soon, adding that considerable progress has been made since October 2004.
Also Monday, security concerns reportedly prompted police to evacuate personnel from the US Embassy in Sarajevo.
The area around the building was blocked off for more than an hour.

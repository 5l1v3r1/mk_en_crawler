Washington adheres to its commitments, stressed Burns, adding that not a single US soldier has been withdrawn from the Balkan missions to be deployed in the Persian Gulf.
In other news, the Bosniak Party for BiH (SBiH) presidency was expected Monday to elect a new leader and deputy leaders of the party. 
The appointments will be made by SBiH's nine-member presidency, who themselves were elected during a party congress Saturday.
Also Saturday, the NGO "Children's Embassy" launched a blood drive in BiH, urging the public to donate blood to children injured during the war in Iraq. 
One organiser said she hoped the young people who survived the siege of Sarajevo would be first in line.

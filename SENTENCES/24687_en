ATHENS, Greece - Border guards arrested two cameramen from Finland's state TV on Saturday (June 6th), for allegedly attempting to enter the country illegally from Turkey. 
Police said on Sunday that the pair was caught trying to cross the Evros River along the Greek-Turkish border. 
They were reportedly trying to film an attempt by illegal immigrants to sneak into the country. 
Guards also detained an illegal immigrant.
In other news, prosecutors ordered on Friday the freezing of bank accounts owned by Siemens' former financial manager in Greece, Christos Karavellas. 
He is being sought on corruption charges. 
Karavellas fled the country last week just before a court hearing where he was to face charges of bribery and money-laundering, in connection with contracts signed between Siemens' Greek branch and Greece's largest telecom company OTE, from 1994 to 1997.
Meanwhile, an earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale rattled western Greece on Sunday, causing damage but no injuries, media reported. 
It was felt throughout the northern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic criticised the work of the judiciary Thursday (6 May), saying it could have prevented the trials at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague if it had prosecuted the cases in a timely manner. 
This, he added, might have prevented other crimes. 
Judicial reform and co-operation with The Hague are key issues on the road to EU membership.
In other news Thursday, Croatia announced details of a border control project it has launched with the European Commission. 
The main objective is to curb cross border crimes, particularly illegal immigration, by boosting co-operation among various border control services.

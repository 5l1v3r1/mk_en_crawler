TIRANA, Albania -- In a speech to his party's congress Sunday (April 13th), the leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), Ilir Meta, said that the close covert collaboration between Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), Edi Rama, is damaging public interests. 
He added that the opposition coalition is being destroyed by Rama's alliance with Berisha. 
To illustrate the point, Meta said that the electoral system proposed by the SP and Berisha's ruling Democratic Party (DP), which is based on the Spanish model, would exclude 1/3 of Albanian voters. 
He also blamed Berisha for the country's economic problems, including high inflation and high foreign debt.
In response, SP lawmaker Taulant Balla said the SMI has returned to old, angry political rhetoric. 
He accused Meta of attacking and accusing the SP over "necessary election reform, which is in the interest of all Albanians", while at the same time working behind the scenes with the ruling DP to try to remove Rama as the mayor of Tirana.

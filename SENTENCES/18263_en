BELGRADE, Serbia â US Ambassador to Serbia Michael Polt has expressed his confidence that a new resolution on Kosovo would be adopted at the UN Security Council by the end of this month.
In an interview with B92 on Friday (May 11th), Polt stressed that the current status quo was unsustainable.
It would be better, he said, that the status resolution take place in a controlled, organised and civilised manner, one which would guarantee the rights of all people living in Kosovo.

ATHENS, Greece -- Senior diplomats and energy officials from the member countries of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Organisation met in Komotini on Friday (22 April) to discuss an agreement between Russia, Bulgaria and Greece on the construction of a major oil pipeline that would bypass the Bosphorus and provide cheaper oil to the West.
Envoys from Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia-Montenegro, Turkey and Ukraine are expected to sign a declaration Saturday, pledging to expand energy and trade ties.
Evripidis Stylianidis, the Greek Foreign Ministry undersecretary for international trade, said increased co-operation between businesses and numerous joint ventures have spurred governments in the region to consider closer ties.

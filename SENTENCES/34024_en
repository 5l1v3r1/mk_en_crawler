BUCHAREST, Romania -- The new German ambassador to Romania, Wilfried Gruber, reaffirmed his country's support for Romania's efforts to become an EU member. 
In an interview with the Rompres news agency on Tuesday (29 July), Gruber said Romania's goal of membership in 2007 was achievable but depended on government efforts to accelerate reforms in specific areas, including the harmonisation of Romanian legislation with that of the EU.

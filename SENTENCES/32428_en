SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Friday (21 March) gave the BiH Federation Justice Ministry its opinion on 115 alleged war crimes cases. 
The cases were sent to the tribunal by the local court in Mostar and involve Bosniaks accused of crimes against humanity during the 1992-1995 war. 
The Hague tribunal found sufficient evidence to proceed with only one of the cases. 
Five others were placed in the so-called C category, meaning there is currently not enough evidence to file charges.

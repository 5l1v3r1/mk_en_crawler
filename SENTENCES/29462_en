BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested Nenad Borojevic, director of the Institute for Oncology and Radiology, and six other people Wednesday (June 30th). 
They are suspected of taking bribes worth 1m euros from pharmaceutical companies, in connection with cancer treatment medicines. 
Investigators say patients were prescribed higher than necessary doses of cytostatic drugs in order to boost medicine consumption. 
The institute has links to former fashion model Katarina Rebraca's charity fund. 
She was arrested in April for allegedly embezzling hundreds of thousands of euros from her breast cancer prevention foundation.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Chief of General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit paid a visit to the presidential palace Monday (September 10th) to congratulate President Abdullah Gul on his recent election. 
Buyukanit and Gul met in private for 45 minutes, then shook hands and smiled for reporters, apparently to demonstrate that strained relations have eased. 
The courtesy meeting is being seen as an important gesture of reconciliation between the military and the presidency, as Buyukanit had opposed Gul's candidacy because of his Islamist past.
On Tuesday, Gul kicks off a tour of five Turkish provinces in four days. 
He plans to visit Van, Hakkari, Siirt, Sirnak and Diyarbakir.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- A delegation of Kosovo lawmakers participated for the first time in a European Parliament (EP) session Wednesday (May 28th).
They presented Kosovo's new constitution, which takes effect on June 15th.
Kosovo media reported the first official raising of the Kosovo flag at an EU institution.
Dutch MEP and Kosovo Rapporteur to the EP Joost Langedijk led the discussion on who will be in charge after June 15th, adding that he is concerned any delay in deploying the EULEX mission would cause problems for both the EU and Pristina.
For his part, Kosovo Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi asked the EU and UN to move forward with implementation of the supervised independence plan drafted by former UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari.
On Monday and Tuesday, the first known meeting between Serb and Kosovar MPs at an international forum took place at the EP.
They attended a joint parliamentary meeting on the Western Balkans with MEPs and MPs from around Europe.
The state of the economy, the role of parliaments and visa issues were on the agenda.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said on Thursday (August 14th) he is hopeful about the assessment of Serbia's co-operation with the tribunal by its chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz. 
He visits Serbia next month to prepare his final report. 
Ljajic said the Serbian government believes the arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic last month is proof of Serbia's readiness to fulfil its obligations to The Hague.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The EU should wait for the formation of a new cabinet in Zagreb later this month before deciding on measures against Croatia, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Wednesday (January 2nd). 
He was responding to an announcement by Croatia that a unilaterally declared protected fishing zone would apply to all EU members, including Slovenia and Italy. 
The EU has denounced the Croatian move, arguing it violates its rules and an earlier agreement with Zagreb. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Ollie Rehn warned that failing to resolve the issue would have negative consequences on Croatia's membership bid. 
However, local media reports say that the country lacks the technical means to enforce the vast zone.

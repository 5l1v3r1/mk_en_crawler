THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Judges in the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told prosecutors Thursday (5 February) that they must complete their case by 19 February. 
In written orders the court gave the prosecution five more trial days to lay out its case. 
The sessions will last hours longer to meet the deadline. 
Milosevic would then get three months to prepare his defence. 
The trial has so far lasted two years and has been delayed often by the defendant's health problems. 
Sessions were cancelled this entire week because Milosevic had the flu.

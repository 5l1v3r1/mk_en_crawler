WASHINGTON, United States -- Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters on Tuesday (15 April) that the administration is pleased with Turkey's co-operation in the effort to disarm the regime in Iraq. 
"There is no secret to the fact that we were very disappointed last month when the Turkish Parliament was unable to act on what we believe was a very important request. 
That disappointment is real, but it is now also history and we are moving forward and I think the relationship that we have with Turkey is strong and solid," he said. 
Powell added that he has not yet made a decision on granting financial assistance to Turkey under President George W Bush's war budget. 
Lawmakers set aside about $1 billion for Ankara but the law requires the secretary of state to decide whether and how much of the money should actually be given.

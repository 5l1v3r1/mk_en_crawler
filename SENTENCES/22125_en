BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanians will receive biometric passports starting in January 1st 2009, President Traian Basescu announced Friday (July 18th).
The new passports will include the fingerprints and a scanned photo of the holder.
Under its obligations as an EU-member state, Romania was supposed to introduce the biometric passports in January 2007 but failed to meet that deadline.
There will be three types of the new identity documents -- simple, diplomatic and business.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serb voters went to the polls on Sunday (January 20th) in a presidential election at a crucial time in its history. 
The main rivals are expected to be the reformist incumbent Boris Tadic and ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic. 
Polls show that neither Tadic nor Nikolic will receive more than 50% of the vote, which will result in a run-off on February 3rd.
Serbia's Supreme Court ruled on Sunday that election observers from the United States and Great Britain should be allowed to monitor the vote. 
The Central Election Commission earlier stated it would not allow representatives of the two countries which openly support Kosovo's independence to monitor the vote, while pro-democratic groups in the country claim that the ban is damaging Serbia's image abroad.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian parliament Thursday (16 October) put off the no-confidence vote against the government and the speaker of parliament, Natasa Micic.
It is now scheduled for next Wednesday.
Critics accuse the government of corruption.
Members of the ruling coalition managed to stave off the vote earlier this week as they scrambled for support.
In other news, the federal government adopted a package of laws aimed at boosting war crimes co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
No specifics were unveiled.
Also Thursday, NATO chief Lord George Robertson said the Alliance has agreed in principle to send Serbia-Montenegro troops to help with efforts in Afghanistan.
Belgrade would decide whether to serve under US or UN command.

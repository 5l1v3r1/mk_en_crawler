ZAGREB, Croatia -- Investigators with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague have questioned another Croatian journalist, for publishing confidential documents. 
Davor Ivankovic of the Zagreb-based Vecernji List newspaper was interviewed at The Hague's Zagreb office on Thursday (November 15th) because he reported classified information related to the war crimes trial against three Croatian generals, Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. 
Two other journalists from the Split-based Slobodna Dalmacija did not appear for questioning as scheduled. 
Last week, The Hague tribunal ordered eight Croatian journalists to be questioned for possible contempt of court.

THESSALONIKI, Greece -- The Turkish Army's chief of general staff, General Yasar Buyukanit, is suggesting that Turkey's military aircraft patrolling the Aegean Sea could fly without weapons on board if Greek patrol planes agree to do the same. 
He made the suggestion in Thessaloniki on Tuesday (April 17th), before the start of a summit of Southeast European army chiefs. 
According to Buyukanit, such a measure could put an end to the decades-long military tension in the area. 
He said there is no need for aircraft to be armed, as Greece and Turkey are not enemies. 
Attending the summit with him are the armed forces chiefs of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Macedonia, as well as EU and NATO officials.

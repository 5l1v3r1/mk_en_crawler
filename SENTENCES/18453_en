BUCHAREST, Romania -- Thousands of prison inmates are staging hunger strikes or other forms of protest, demanding better living conditions and early release for inmates sentenced to less than five years, according to local press reports Monday (December 11th).
The protests began at the Brasov facility late last week but have spread to 26 others.
On Sunday, wardens briefed Justice Minister Monica Macovei via videoconference.
She met with Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu on Monday to discuss prison overcrowding.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Voters head to the polls Sunday (June 1st) to choose 3,200 mayors of towns and villages, 41 chairmen of district councils and more than 40,000 council members. 
In area where no candidate wins 50%+1 of the votes, a second round will be held on June 15th. 
A total of 19 candidates are vying for mayor of Bucharest. 
For the first time in the country's history, the vote for chairmen of district councils will be held under the majority system, rather than based on party lists. 
The move is part of electoral reforms being implemented before the parliamentary vote this autumn. 
Another change introduced in Sunday's vote is that representatives of the Romanian Orthodox Church are competing for seats in the district councils, following approval of the Holy Synod. 
The Roma community has also nominated candidates in many regions.

ANKARA, Turkey -- At least twelve Turkish troops were killed and 17 soldiers were wounded on Sunday (October 21st) in a Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) attack near the borders with Iran and Iraq, the Turkish military announced.
Twenty-three PKK militants also died in the violence.
Senior Turkish officials will hold an emergency crisis meeting in Ankara tonight to discuss the first major offensive by Kurdish extremists against the army since Wednesday, when the Turkish parliament approved military operations against the PKK bases in northern Iraq.
The same day, at least one person died and more than ten people were injured in Hakkari when a roadside mine went off as a minibus passed by carrying civilians passed.
In related news, Turkey expects the United States to take urgent measures against the Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday.
He said he will discuss the measures against the PKK when he meets with US President George Bush in Washington on November 5th.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 1,500 people gathered in the eastern town of Vukovar on Saturday (January 29th) to protest the arrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) of a Croat war veteran wanted for war crimes in Serbia. 
Tihomir Purda, who fought in Vukovar, was detained earlier this month at the border between Croatia and BiH, based on a Serbian arrest warrant.
Meanwhile, the human right watchdog Amnesty International said in a statement Saturday that it will send a delegation to Brussels next week. 
The representatives will urge officials there "to continue insisting that Croatian authorities prosecute all war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 war, including those where high-profile officials were allegedly responsible".

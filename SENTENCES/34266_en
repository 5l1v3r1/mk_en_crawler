ANKARA, Turkey -- On Tuesday (1 July), parliament discussed the government's reform programme, which outlines proposed steps to be taken in order to comply with EU accession requirements.
The national programme is aimed at opening accession negotiations by the end of 2004;
it will be submitted to the European Council this month.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul vowed that all necessary legislation would be passed by parliament before its August recess.
Gul also said Tuesday that the government would resubmit the 6th EU harmonisation package to parliament without amendments.
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed the reform package on Monday.
In other news, Gul announced that Turkey would not be sending peacekeepers to neighbouring Iraq, saying Turkish forces have fulfilled their obligations in accordance with NATO membership and promises made to the United States.

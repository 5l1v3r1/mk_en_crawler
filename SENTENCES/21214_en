SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Federation of BiH (FBiH) ruling coalition leaders will meet on July 9th to discuss the latest challenges facing the government, FBiH Vice-President Mirsad Kebo said on Saturday (June 28th) in an interview with the Dnevni Avaz newspaper.
He explained that the meeting, initially scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed so that leaders of all four FBiH government parties -- the Party of Democratic Action, Party of BiH, Croatian Democratic Union BiH (HDZ) and HDZ 1990 -- could attend.
The session would focus on resolving budget issues and on management reshuffles in large state companies, a contentious issue recently between the main Bosniak and Croat parties.
In other news, thousands of Bosnian Muslims joined a pilgrimage Sunday to a ravine they believe Allah created near Mount Ajvatovica.
The devout revived the 7km trip after its banning for more than a half-century by communist rulers.
The legend dates back to the mid-15th century when Turks occupied Bosnian territory.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Influential businessman Slobodan Zupljanin resigned as chairman of the BiH Foreign Trade Chamber, Dnevni Avaz reported on Tuesday (July 17th), though the Chamber's general assembly must still accept the resignation. 
Zupljanin reportedly decided to step down after he was included in a list of 93 people from Republika Srpska suspected of involvement in the network supporting war crimes indictees. 
Last week, the Office of High Representative confiscated the travel documents of these 93 people, including Zupljanin. 
One of his relatives, high profile indictee Stojan Zupljanin, has been on the run since 1999.

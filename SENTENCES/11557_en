PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro -- The government of Kosovo expressed concern Thursday (21 July) about the possibility that armed groups might attempt to further their political goals by using force in Macedonia. 
The cabinet of Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi voiced support for the Macedonian government in implementing the Ohrid Agreement, noting that any instability in Macedonia could have negative consequences for Kosovo as well. 
Officials stressed that anyone attempting to use force in Macedonia will neither be welcomed, nor receive moral support, in Kosovo.

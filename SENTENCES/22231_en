BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU's Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) decided on Thursday (June 12th) in Brussels to open two more accession negotiating chapters with Turkey next week on company law and intellectual property law.
That would mean a total of eight chapters since Turkey opened its accession talks in 2005.

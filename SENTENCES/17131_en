NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Rival leaders of ethnically divided Cyprus meet on Monday (3 July) for the first time since peace talks collapsed two years ago, in an encounter many hope will help ease Turkey's attempts to join the EU. 
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are expected to discuss the fate of people missing in past conflicts, but diplomats say it is the meeting itself that marks a turning point. 
"This is a highly significant meeting, breaking two years marked by the absence of dialogue between the two leaders, and at the very least it may break the ice," said a Nicosia-based diplomat.
Split since a Turkish invasion in 1974, the Cyprus conflict has defied repeated UN-led peace efforts and threatens to derail Turkey's EU accession efforts.

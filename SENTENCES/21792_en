ATHENS, Greece -- PASOK leader George Papandreou said on Monday (September 22nd) that his party, the main opposition one in Greece, is ready for early general elections.
Papandreou, however, said before that happens, the government should "clean up the scandals" embroiling it.
"We want to end corruption and get the country out of this crisis," Papandreou told Reuters.
He added that those involved with corruption should be prosecuted.
Recent polls suggest that for the first time in years, PASOK is more popular than the ruling New Democracy party.

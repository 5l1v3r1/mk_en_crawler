ATHENS, Greece -- Muslim associations in Athens have filed a lawsuit against a policeman who allegedly desecrated a copy of the Koran last week, media reported on Monday (May 25th). 
Last Thursday, the policeman allegedly took a Koran from a customer during a police check at an Athens coffee shop, ripped it apart, threw it on the floor and stomped on it. 
Police say the officer did not know it was Islam's holy book. 
The Pakistani community in Greece called on the government to assume responsibility for the incident and demanded an apology from authorities. 
The incident prompted two days of protests by hundreds of Muslims in central Athens. 
Violent clashes with police on Friday injured at least 14 people and damage several businesses; 46 people were arrested.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament is expected to begin the process of electing a new president of the country on August 20th, local and international media reported on Friday (August 10th). 
Parliament's advisory board has recommended a second round of voting on the August 24th, if need be. 
Two more rounds can follow that. 
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which holds a large majority in the house, reportedly has not decided whether to nominate Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul again. 
His bid in May was met with stiff opposition by the secular establishment and the military. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted on Friday that the AKP may nominate more than one candidate.
Also Friday, parliament elected its general administrative board. 
It consists of 17 people, including Speaker Koksal Toptan. 
For the first time ever, two women -- Guldal Mumcu and Meral Aksener -- are deputy speakers.

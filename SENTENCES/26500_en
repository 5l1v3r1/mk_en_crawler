SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government proposed a bill Wednesday (November 11th) to allow the widespread confiscation of assets acquired illegally.
Justice Minister Margarita Popova said the legislation would be a key instrument in fighting organised crime and corruption and avoiding EU-imposed penalties.
The measure would replace the current law on confiscating illegally obtained assets, which critics say lacks teeth.
It allows the confiscation of assets only after owners have been convicted.
During investigations, the assets can only be frozen.
But under the new legislation, a parliamentary panel will be allowed to conduct its own investigations and confiscate assets of those who are unable to explain how they got their money, even if they are not convicted.
Also Wednesday, the government announced it has nominated Foreign Minister Rumyana Zheleva as Bulgaria's new EU commissioner.
Zheleva, a former European Parliament member, will replace Bulgaria's current commissioner, Meglena Kuneva, who is in charge of consumer affairs.

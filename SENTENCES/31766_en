BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government announced Sunday (6 April) that it has solved the case of Zoran Djindjic's assassination and is ready to start court proceedings against the perpetrators.
"The majority of the executors are in prison and have confessed, including the one suspected of firing shots at the [prime minister]," Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said in an interview for a local TV station.
He added that the other suspects would be caught in a matter of days.
Federal Defence Minister Boris Tadic meanwhile praised joint efforts by police and the army to apprehend the suspects.
Also Sunday, Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said the government is prepared to extradite two former senior security service officials to the UN tribunal.
Former State Security Chief Jovica Stanisic and his deputy, Franko Simatovic, who headed the Serb Paramilitary units during the war in Bosniaand Herzegovina and Croatia, were arrested in the aftermath of the Djindjic assassination.
The two men are listed in Milosevic's indictment as "accomplices in a joint criminal enterprise".

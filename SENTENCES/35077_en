SKOPJE, Macedonia -- An international foundation named for the late Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski was established in Skopje on Friday (25 June).
According to the founders, the organisation's main goal would be to continue Trajkovski's ideas, including promoting peace and reconciliation, improving education and developing society.
Trajkovski was killed in a plane earlier this year.

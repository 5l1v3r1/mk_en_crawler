SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) again warned on Tuesday (January 16th) that the international community would not tolerate the use of anti-Dayton rhetoric in BiH and the region. 
OHR spokesman Mario Brkic criticised attempts to link the future of BiH's entity Republika Srpska (RS) to that of Kosovo â a suggestion made recently by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
Brkic stressed that as a signatory to the Dayton Peace Accord, Serbia should observe its commitments. 
He also criticised recent statements by RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who favours establishing a third, Croatian entity in BiH.
Separately Tuesday, Haris Silajdzic, the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, urged the international community to sanction what he called Serbia's "open" aspirations to BiH territory. 
He said the Kosovo issue is an internal one for Serbia, and has nothing to do with BiH.

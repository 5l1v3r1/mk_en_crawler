SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Mostar City Council rejected Mostar Commission Chairman Norbert Winterstein's proposal for a new city statute Monday (19 January). 
Winterstein envisioned the reorganisation of the ethnically divided town as one single municipality with seven election units. 
As expected, the main opponents were representatives of the nationalist Muslim Party of Democratic Action and the Croatian Democratic Community. 
High Representative Paddy Ashdown told the Sarajevo daily <I>Oslobodjenje</I> that he would impose a decision if no compromise is reached.
Ashdown, meanwhile, travels to Zagreb on Tuesday to discuss Mostar and other issues with Croatian President Stipe Mesic and new Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday (3 June) that his country is on track to join the EU after ten or 15 years, despite the rejection of the new European Constitution by France and the Netherlands. 
Erdogan expressed disappointment with the outcome of the referenda in the two countries but said it should not be attributed to anti-Turkish sentiments.
Also Friday, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed changes in the country's new penal code and returned the draft to parliament for revision. 
His office says Sezer viewed some texts as too controversial. 
The code must be amended to advance Turkey's EU accession bid.

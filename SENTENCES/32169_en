TIRANA, Albania -- The customs administrations of Albania and Kosovo plan to consolidate efforts in the fight against smuggling.
The heads of the two agencies met Monday (11 November) in Tirana, along with a UNMIK official specialising in customs issues.
All three agreed that co-operation has been fruitful since the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2001.
Tirana's customs administration praised the commitment of its Kosovo counterpart in preventing illegal goods from making their way across the border.

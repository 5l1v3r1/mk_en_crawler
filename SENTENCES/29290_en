BELGRADE, Serbia -- Crime boss Sreten Jocic, aka Joca Amsterdam, was sentenced on Thursday (June 3rd) to 15 years in prison for arranging the murder of a rival. 
Goran Marjanovic was killed in 1995 outside a Belgrade bar, and several people were injured in the incident. 
According to the indictment, Jocic had promised 50,000 Deutche Marks to two hit men, providing them with weapons and the getaway car. 
During the trial, he denied any connection with the murder. 
Jocic is also on trial for the October 2008 murder of prominent Croatian journalist Ivo Pukanic.

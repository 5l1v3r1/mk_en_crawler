THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal sentenced Croatian journalist Domagoj Margetic to three months in prison Wednesday (February 8th) for contempt of court.
Last year, Margetic published a list on his personal website, revealing the identities of 48 protected witnesses in the 1997 trial of former Bosnian Croat military commander Tihomir Blaskic, despite explicit warnings from the tribunal.
The ruling also forces Margetic to pay a hefty fine.

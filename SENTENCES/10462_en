WASHINGTON, United States -- A senior US diplomat warned on Thursday (16 September) that rejection of Macedonia's new territorial organisation laws in an upcoming referendum would "run counter to the word and spirit of the Framework Agreement, which calls for fair opportunities for minority communities as the basis for an integrated, multiethnic, democratic Macedonia". 
At an OSCE Permanent Council meeting, Bruce Connuck added that rejecting the laws would also hamper efforts to make Macedonian institutions more transparent and responsive. 
The OSCE predicts turnout will be high for the 7 November referendum, with as many as 500,000 people expected to participate.

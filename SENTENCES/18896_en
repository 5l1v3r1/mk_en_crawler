MOSCOW, Russian Federation -- The EU Troika, consisting of German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, EU Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner and EU security chief Javier Solana, visited Moscow on Monday (February 5th) to discuss Kosovo and other issues.
They are expected to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Diplomatic say the three officials are seeking to assess how wide the gap is between the EU and Russian positions on Kosovo status.
Russia has been warning it could use its Security Council veto if it concludes the proposal is being imposed against Belgrade's will.

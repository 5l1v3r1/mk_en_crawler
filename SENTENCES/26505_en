BELGRADE, Serbia -- A nationalist group called 1389 put up posters honouring war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic along a street in downtown Belgrade on Friday (March 12th). 
The posters, which read "Boulevard of Ratko Mladic", were plastered over existing signs along a street named after Zoran Djindjic, the first pro-democracy president of Serbia, on the seventh anniversary of Djindjic's assassination. 
The posters were removed soon after they went up.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski and his Albanian counterpart Alfred Moisiu met on Monday (February 26th) to discuss the latest progress in the NATO-related reform agenda and further co-operation among the three Adriatic Charter signatory-countries. 
The two said they are confident that Albania, Croatia and Macedonia will be invited to join the Alliance at the next NATO summit, in 2008. 
The two presidents also expressed satisfaction with the current level of bilateral relations and vowed to boost economic and cultural collaboration.
Crvenkovski also reiterated that the proposal by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari is a good basis for resolving Kosovo's final status, which he said is necessary for lasting peace and stability in the Balkans.

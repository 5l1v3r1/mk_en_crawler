SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Five members of a Bosnian Serb family were killed Monday (10 March) died when a mine left over from the 1992-1995 conflict exploded as they worked in a field.
The family had returned recently to their native village of Brnik, in northern BiH.
Meanwhile, in Mostar on Monday, a Bosnian Muslim confessed to killing an entire Croat returnee family in the village of Kostajnica (southern BiH) last Christmas.
But Muamer Topalovic recanted earlier testimony that the murders were premeditated, saying now that he was only trying to scare the family.

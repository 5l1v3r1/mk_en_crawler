SOFIA, Bulgaria -- NATO has voiced concerns over the slowdown in army modernisation in Bulgaria and warned that deadlines for the implementation of related projects would be probably revised, Defence Minister Vesselin Bliznakov confirmed Friday (21 October), following a visit to the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels. 
He said NATO officials insisted that Bulgaria should set aside at least 2.6 per cent of its GDP for defence and must continue to modernise its military, in order to ensure interoperability. 
A NATO mission is expected in Sofia next week.

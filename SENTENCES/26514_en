ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic on Monday (August 10th) asked the Constitutional Court to rule on a temporary new tax that is scheduled to remain in effect through next year.
As of August 1st, revenues from wages, pensions, dividends and bonuses between 400 and 800 euros are taxed at 2%, while those that exceed that amount are taxed at 4%.
Mesic insists this tax "does not respect the principles of justice, equality and proportionality" and will most affect the poorest people.
Economy Minister Damir Polancec says Mesic has every right to challenge the measure and that the government will await the court's decision.

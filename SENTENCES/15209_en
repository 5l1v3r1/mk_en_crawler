SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev demanded on Friday (28 April) that the immunity granted to parliament members be lifted for Volen Siderov, leader of the ultranationalist formation Attack.
Velchev cited his intention to investigate and possibly press charges against Siderov on three counts -- perjury, forcing other people to commit perjury, and obstruction of justice -- in relation to a recent highway incident.
Each of these counts carries up to five years in prison.
Siderov in turn rejected the claims and refused to give up immunity voluntarily.
In other news, the head of the National Guard Service (NSO), General Rumen Milanov, confirmed in an interview Saturday that the NSO is guarding Ahmet Dogan, the leader of the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) because of a death threat he received.
MRF is a junior partner in the tripartite coalition cabinet.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government approved a 28% pay hike for teachers that will take effect in increments, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu announced after a cabinet meeting Monday (November 10th). 
The raise will take place in two stages next year, in March and in September. 
"This is the best solution Romania's budget can handle," Tariceanu said. 
The cabinet bowed to pressure from unions representing the teachers, who staged a two-hour warning strike Monday. 
They were protesting an earlier decision by the government to postpone until April a 50% raise parliament had approved for them. 
Tariceanu also pledged raises for employees in other public sectors, such as healthcare.

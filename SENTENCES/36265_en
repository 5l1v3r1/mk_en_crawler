ANKARA, Turkey -- EU membership is not in itself an end goal for the Turkish government, Turkish Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc stated Sunday (29 February).
Rather, he said, EU standards, law and democracy are the way to achieving the ultimate aim of ensuring justice, prosperity and freedom for all.
Also on Sunday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the government will no longer play the role of an employer of last resort and that people cannot count on easily finding jobs with the government anymore.
The tightening of public employment rules comes within the framework for cutting government expenditures, as required by the IMF.

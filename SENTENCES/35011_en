SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Zehra Kacapor, the UNDP co-ordinator for a report on problems facing BiH youth, says the government must take urgent measures to include young people in public life. 
Presenting the report at Sunday's (7 December) session of the Association of Independent Intellectuals "Krug 99", Kacapor warned that if the current negative trend continues, in 2020 BiH would be left with a shortage of young people. 
She cites a lack of employment opportunities, dissatisfaction with the educational system and distrust in local politicians.
In other news, the second annual conference promoting investment opportunities in BiH will be held in London on Tuesday. 
Representatives of over 200 British companies are expected to attend, along with a senior BiH delegation led by High Representative Paddy Ashdown.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Wednesday (October 3rd) that Serbia's progress in efforts to catch war crimes indictees has been rather slow. 
In an official statement by her spokesperson, Olga Kavran, del Ponte warned that the pace might lead to an overall failure to arrest the remaining fugitives. 
She met with officials in Belgrade two weeks ago, ahead of filing a report with EU representatives later this month regarding Serbia's level of co-operation.

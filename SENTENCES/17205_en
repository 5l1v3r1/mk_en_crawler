BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The EU deadline for the capture of Ratko Mladic expired on Sunday (30 April) with the fugitive still at large.
The Union has said it would suspend talks with Belgrade on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the first step towards membership, if the general were not delivered to The Hague during April.
The next round was scheduled for 11 May.
An official EU decision will be forthcoming after Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn meets with chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Wednesday.
An earlier end-of-March deadline was extended by the EU after Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica pledged Mladic's handover was imminent.
Federal Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who is also Belgrade's official in charge of co-operation with the UN court, now says authorities have gained more information about Mladic, but not enough to find him.

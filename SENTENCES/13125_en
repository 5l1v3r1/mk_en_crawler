BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Several EU member states reportedly are seeking a last-minute tightening of the framework for accession talks with Turkey, approximately a week before the planned start on 3 October.
According to diplomatic sources cited by the EU Observer on Monday (26 September), Cyprus still wants formal recognition of the Greek Cypriot state to be included as a condition for talks.
France and Austria are also said to want tougher texts in the framework.
In Vienna on Monday, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik said that while negotiations might lead to full membership for Ankara, privileged partnership should remain a possible alternative.
In Ankara meanwhile, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek criticised the current draft framework.
Following a cabinet meeting Monday, he said Turkey objected to some issues in the draft and suggested it would seek revisions.

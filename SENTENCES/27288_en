ATHENS, Greece -- Members of the police anti-terror squad arrested a man Sunday (November 1st) suspected of having supplied weapons to the terrorist organisation Sect of Revolutionaries. 
The suspect was carrying a bag with a gun, a protective vest and wireless transmitters when detained near Athens. 
Police say he is a close ally of mafia boss Vassilis Paleocostas, who managed to escape an Athens prison by helicopter earlier this year. 
In February, the Sect of Revolutionaries made headlines when it claimed responsibility for several attacks against police stations in Greece.

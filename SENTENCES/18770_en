BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors filed an indictment Friday (January 5th) against former Economy Minister Codrut Seres, who is charged with treason and leaking confidential information stemming from an ongoing privatisation scandal.
The case involves the acquisition of state assets and economic espionage allegedly favouring the interests of a transnational crime group.
According to weekend media reports, the indictment includes transcripts of several phone calls between Seres and alleged crime boss Stamen Stantchev, a Bulgarian national.
Seres resigned from the government in December, after his Conservative Party left the ruling coalition.
He has denied the accusations.

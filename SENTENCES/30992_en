TIRANA, Albania -- A court in Tirana decided on Monday (February 7th) to move three suspects in the so-called Gerdec case out of detention and into house arrest. 
The court said the suspects have spent the maximum allowable time in detention since the munitions depot explosions that killed 26 people and injured hundreds in March 2008. 
The ruling applies to Mihail Delijorgji, Ylli Pinari and Sokol Ngjeci. 
All held key positions at the ammunition dismantling depot where the deadly blasts occurred. 
Another 26 people are under investigation, including senior military officials.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The opposition coalition led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) voiced its readiness Sunday (July 11th) for early elections.
SDP leader Zoran Milanovic, the Croatian People's Party's Radimir Cacic, the Istrian Democratic Assembly's Ivan Jakovcic and the Croatian Pensioners' Party's Silvano Hrelja said that their coalition has a clear alternative and strategy for Croatia.
They say the country is facing a difficult situation that the current government is unable to handle.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor ruled out any possibility of snap elections after the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) left the ruling coalition on Saturday.
Its main motive, the HSLS said, was its dissatisfaction with the government's handling of public finances and its energy policy.

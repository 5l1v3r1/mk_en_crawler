ANKARA, Turkey -- Prosecutors filed charges on Thursday (June 24th) against nine people detained for suspected involvement in Tuesday's deadly attack on a military bus in Istanbul.
The remote-controlled bomb killed five people.
Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu told a press conference that investigators have evidence suggesting the suspects planned a second attack.
Ten other suspects that had been rounded up were released.
The separatist Kurdish group Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, with links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack.
In other news, two soldiers and a civilian were killed by PKK personnel in an attack late Thursday on a military checkpoint in eastern Turkey.
Six other people were injured.

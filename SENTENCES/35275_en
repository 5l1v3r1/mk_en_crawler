BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's democratic parties have reached an agreement in principle on forming a minority government, following meetings late Wednesday (18 February).
G17 Plus head Miroljub Labus and New Serbia chief Velimir Ilic acknowledged the breakthrough.
The agreement includes the government's programme and its general make-up, except for the post of agriculture minister.
Vojislav Kostunica, the head of Democratic Party of Serbia, recently said that a government would be formed by month's end.
Also participating in the government will be the Serbian Renewal Movement.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament adopted the budget for 2011 on Thursday (March 31st) with the opposition strongly opposing the bill.
The governing coalition -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo, the New Kosovo Alliance and the minorities -- managed to secure 66 votes, with the opposition either voting against, abstaining or boycotting the session.
Vetevendosje Movement lawmakers abandoned the session in sign of dissatisfaction with the fact that the budget paves way for the privatization of the Kosovo Post and Telecom (PTK).
The adoption of the budget was followed by major protests and clashes between police and PTK unionists.
The opposition is concerned that Kosovo risks entering financial crisis as it is already planning the spending of privatization money and international donations for this year.

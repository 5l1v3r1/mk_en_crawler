BERLIN, Germany -- Meeting Friday (17 January) during Berlin's so-called Green Week, Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Mehmed Dikme discussed quotas for agricultural exports with EU Commissioner for Agriculture Franz Fischler. 
Dikme says Bulgaria would insist on receiving 40 per cent of the direct subsidies for EU farmers upon joining the union, instead of the envisioned 25 per cent.
In other developments, Eneko Landaburu, director general of DG Enlargement at the European Commission, said Friday that the EC would set dates for a peer review of units 3 and 4 at Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear power plant within a few weeks. 
The review was agreed upon late last year when Bulgaria closed the energy chapter of its EU accession negotiations.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and Turkey over the weekend held their first joint military drill, a naval exercise in the Aegean aimed at assessing and improving communications.
Although small in scale, the drill was described as an important step forward in the process of confidence-building measures.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul went before the UN General Assembly on Friday (22 September), and asked that his country receive a seat on the Security Council during the next rotation.
He said it was an "anomaly" that Turkey had not held a seat since 1961.

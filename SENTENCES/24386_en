ZAGREB, Croatia -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini was very cautious Monday (January 12th) regarding Italy potentially mediating the long-standing border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia.
Frattini, who was making an official visit to Zagreb to sign a co-operation memorandum between the two countries, stressed that while Italy would like to see the dispute end quickly, any initiative for a new round of talks should come from the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, the Czech Republic.
The dispute involves the maritime border between Croatia and Slovenia, with the quarrel being mostly over fishing rights in the Adriatic.
Slovenia has threatened to veto closing the acquis on fishing and related areas until the countries find a solution, which may delay Croatia's accession negotiations.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, called on the Security Council Friday (December 15th) to state clearly whether the tribunal should stay open until the remaining Balkan fugitives are tried in The Hague. 
Under the current timeline for completion, all trials at the first instance are to be wrapped up by 2008, and all other work -- including appeals -- finished by the end of 2010. 
However, several indictees remain at large, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
On Friday, del Ponte also urged the Security Council to put pressure on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia to arrest the remaining indictees. 
"Strong messages must be passed to Serbia and BiH so that they finally deliver the fugitives from justice, especially Karadzic and Mladic," she said. 
In response, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic rejected del Ponte's criticism of his country as "unacceptable". 
He insisted that everything possible was being done to track down Mladic and that Serbia is determined to meet its international obligations.

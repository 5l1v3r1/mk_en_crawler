PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK arrested a 21-year-old Serb on Tuesday (19 August) suspected of killing an Indian officer earlier this month. 
Satish Menon, 43, was shot dead after his patrol car was ambushed in northern Kosovo. 
It was the first lethal attack to have taken place against an officer of the multinational UN force.
The suspect was arrested in the northern Mitrovica village of Slatina, UNMIK said in a statement, adding that a number of AK-47 rifles had also been recovered. 
Local media had been trading accusations concerning the identity of the killer, blaming the incident either on Serb or Albanian "gangs".

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament voted unanimously on Saturday (30 September) to adopt a new constitution that describes Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia, with substantial autonomy.
The new constitution also provides a form of self-rule for Vojvodina.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told deputies the law would not be changed regardless of the outcome of UN-mediated talks on the future status of Kosovo.
The constitution must be approved via a national referendum on 28-29 October.
Protestors demonstrated outside parliament, insisting the new constitution is anti-democratic and could harm Serbia's European interests.
In other news, a new special brigade of the Serbian Army was officially inaugurated on Friday.
It was established by merging the army's special units and will be based in Pancevo and Nis.

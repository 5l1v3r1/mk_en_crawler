SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The family of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic could face prosecution for helping him avoid arrest on war crimes charges for years, Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian said on Thursday (August 14th). 
"They remain the subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations," Gregorian told Reuters. 
He said Karadzic's relatives were "active members" of his support network, which is also believed to be helping former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic. 
Following Karadzic's arrest in Belgrade last month, investigators found letters from Dragan Dabic -- the alias Karadzic used -- at his wife's home in BiH.

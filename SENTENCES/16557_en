SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU envoy in Macedonia Erwan Fouere says the future coalition government must reflect the country's multiethnic character, as well as be in accordance with the will of the majority, as expressed via the 5 July parliamentary elections.
In a weekend interview broadcast on Sitel TV, Fouere said the EU expects the coalition to have clear priorities regarding the implementation of crucial reforms.
The latest Early Warning Report issued by the UNDP on Friday concludes that unemployment, poverty and corruption remain the main problems confronting the majority of Macedonian citizens.
The findings were based on a survey conducted in May.

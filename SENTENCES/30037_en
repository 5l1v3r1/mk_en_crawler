BELGRADE, Serbia -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso hailed on Thursday (May 19th) efforts by Serbia so far in the EU integration process, but said much more are needed. 
"The key is in your hands," he said after meeting with Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic in Belgrade. 
Barroso called on authorities to focus on judicial reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime and full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
In other news Thursday, Serbian media reported that UN chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz will submit a negative report on Serbia's co-operation with the tribunal to the UN Security Council. 
The government's strategy to capture the two remaining wartime fugitives is completely unsuccessful, according to report leaks. 
The country must reassess its strategy and immediately address operational deficiencies, Brammertz reportedly notes. 
He formally submits his assessment to the UN next month.

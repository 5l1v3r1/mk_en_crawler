NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus voiced a protest to the UN on Monday (July 21st) over a series of violations of national airspace by Turkish warplanes during anniversary ceremonies Sunday marking the arrival of Turkish troops to the northern part of the divided island in 1974.
Four Turkish F-5's took off from the Lefkoniko airport in the northern part of the island and flew over areas controlled by Cyprus, according to the defence ministry.
The incident occurred days before a crucial meeting between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat that is scheduled for Friday.

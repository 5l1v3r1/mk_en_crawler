TREBINJE, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- During a visit to eastern Herzegovina on Wednesday (7 May), High Representative Paddy Ashdown praised the work of the BiH State Border Service (SBS).
Ashdown, who visited several border crossings in the region, credited the SBS for the sharp drop in crime, including smuggling.
In other news, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) is preparing a list of 25 BiH citizens who would be banned from entering EU member countries.
OHR spokesman Julian Braithwaite refused to reveal any names Wednesday, but said those involved are suspected of organised crime, money laundering or supporting war crimes suspects.

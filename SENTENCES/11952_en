ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament approved on Tuesday (12 July) the appointment of former Virovit Mayor Ivica Kirin, 35, as the new interior minister. 
His predecessor, Marijan Mlinaric, stepped down citing health reasons. 
But some speculate the failure to arrest war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina was the real reason.
Also Tuesday, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot visited Zagreb, praising the government's action plan to locate and arrest Gotovina. 
Bot added that Croatia has made remarkable progress in EU integration and has already managed to implement a significant part of EU legislation.

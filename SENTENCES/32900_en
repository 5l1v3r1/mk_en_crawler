VATICAN CITY -- Pope John Paul II on Saturday (30 November) urged Bosnians to turn their backs on hatred and encourage refugees to return.
"It is true that one cannot erase from memory all that which has happened in the past, but one can and one must free hearts from rancor and vendetta," he said at a meeting with Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) new ambassador to the Holy See.
The pope lamented the fact that seven years after the war ended, many refugees are still unable to return to their homes.

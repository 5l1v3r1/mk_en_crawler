ZAGREB, Croatia -- An international arrest warrant for Croatian Gen Janko Bobetko has been published on Interpol's web site. 
The warrant, released at the request of the Hague-based war crimes tribunal, charged the 83-year-old Bobetko with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war. 
Zinka Bardic, spokeswoman for the Croatian Interior Ministry, described the Interpol announcement as standard procedure following an indictment. 
She added that while the constitutional law on co-operation with the tribunal makes the government responsible for ensuring co-operation on war crimes, all legal means had not been exhausted. 
Meanwhile, Bobetko's lawyer, Bosiljko Misetic, said he had received no official information about the warrant on Interpol's site.

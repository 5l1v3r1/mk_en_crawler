BERLIN, Germany -- Interior Minister Otto Schily said Saturday (28 December) that the espionage trial against several German NGOs may undermine Turkey's attempts to join the EU.
Prosecutors launched a trial Thursday against a number of German organisations on charges of violating Turkey's national security.
Among the accused are eight German citizens, one of them with dual citizenship, who allegedly tried to damage Turkey's social order and national unity in partnership with local movements.
Schily told the German magazine Welt am Sonntag that his government takes this very seriously.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's ruling party, is trying to play down the case and insists the defendants will receive a "fair trial".

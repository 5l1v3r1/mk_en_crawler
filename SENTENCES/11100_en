BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokeswoman, Krisztina Nagy, called Monday (27 June) for the quick formation of a new government in Bulgaria, so there are no delays in the EU accession timetable.
The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) came in first in Saturday's parliamentary elections, but without the majority needed to govern on its own.
BSP Deputy Chairman Rumen Ovcharov signaled on Monday that the party might invite the National Movement Simeon II into a coalition.
The Movement for Rights and Freedoms may also be approached on Tuesday.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) has called on the government to submit draft changes in the electoral laws to parliament as soon as possible.
A PNL official said Wednesday (17 September) that his party is concerned about the ruling Social Democrats' "unnecessary" delay of amendments, calling it an attempt to block opposition efforts to establish a common strategy for future elections.

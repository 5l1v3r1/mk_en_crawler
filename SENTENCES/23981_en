NICOSIA, Cyprus/ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias failed to reach an agreement on the issue of security guarantees at their 37th round of direct reunification talks on Friday (July 17th). 
The Turkish Cypriot side favours maintaining the current guarantee system under the existing international treaties, while the Greek Cypriot administration insists for a change, Talat told reporters after the meeting.
Meanwhile Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned that the ongoing peace process may be the last chance to reunify the divided island. 
"Negotiations would either end the division, or we would all have to consider alternative ways," he said in an interview with state-run broadcaster TRT.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragomir Dumic, the nominee for the new state defence minister post, has withdrawn his name from consideration, reportedly citing concerns related to the verification procedure. 
At the weekend, senior BiH parliamentarian Nikola Spiric said the Office of the High Representative was poised to reject the nomination, as Dumic lacked support from the international community. 
According to local media reports, the Serb Democratic Party may nominate foreign ministry official Nikola Radovanovic instead.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown was in London on Monday (8 March), where he met with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. 
Ashdown's office said all agreed BiH must speed up the implementation of reforms.

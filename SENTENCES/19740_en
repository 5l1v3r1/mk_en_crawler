ATHENS, Greece -- The foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania expressed strong support Saturday (December 22nd) for the European perspective of all Western Balkan countries.
Ivailo Kalfin, Dora Bakoyannis and Adrian Cioroianu, who gathered in Athens for their traditional annual meeting, said Serbia's future is within the EU and its membership should not be connected in any way to the Kosovo status issue.
They also called for further diplomatic efforts to settle Kosovo's future.
"We should be very careful in the search for a solution that would guarantee stability in the region," the three diplomats said in a statement.
Speaking to reporters, Kalfin said Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU should be signed soon.
However, he warned that all the criteria must be met, including full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

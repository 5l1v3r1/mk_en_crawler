SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The three members of the Serb Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) in the BiH Council of Ministers -- Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, Transport Minister Branko Dokic and Deputy Civil Affairs Minister Zoran Tesanovic -- have withdrawn their resignations, according to a PDP statement Wednesday (9 March).
The news was confirmed by BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, who said it was the result of a political agreement reached among the main BiH parties during their recent meeting in Neum.
Both the PDP and Terzic suggested that the move would speed up implementation of EU Feasibility Study requirements.
The three PDP ministers resigned in December in the wake of High Representative Paddy Ashdown's sanctions against Republika Srpska.

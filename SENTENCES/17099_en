SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission, Mihajlo Manevski, says the government is attempting to pressure the panel.
In an interview with the magazine Macedonia in Europe, quoted by local media Monday (1 May), Manevski criticised what he described as "orchestrated attacks from the ruling coalition", including "threats" to dismiss or replace commission members, and accusations of co-operation with the opposition.

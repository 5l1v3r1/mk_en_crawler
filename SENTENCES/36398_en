BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey and Greece agree in principle that defence expenditures could be reduced through mutual confidence-building measures, Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said Monday (17 May).
Gonul met Greek counterpart Spilios Spiliotopopoulos on the sidelines of the meeting of EU and non-EU NATO member countries' defence ministers in Brussels.
The two officials declared a common desire to enhance bilateral relations and strengthen co-operation in fighting terrorism.
Greece has decided to cancel contracts for the procurement of a corvette and 300 armoured personnel carriers, the AFP reported Monday.
Less than a week ago, Turkey dropped plans to buy new aircraft and tanks that would have cost up to $10 billion.

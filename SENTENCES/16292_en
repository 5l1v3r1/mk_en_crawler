TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who leads the ruling Democratic Party (DP), proposed at a press conference Thursday (13 April) that the DP and the main opposition Socialist Party reduce the number of their members in the parliamentary commission on electoral reform and abandon the right to veto. 
His proposal to the SP followed an appeal Wednesday by OSCE Ambassador to Tirana, Pavel Vacek. 
He urged the commission to resume work immediately after a two-month stalemate.

The heads of the Serbian, Slovenian and Croatian railroads signed an agreement last month in Belgrade to introduce a direct cargo train, Sava Ekspres, which will run once a week among Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana. 
The first phase in a larger project to connect European railways with Istanbul, the planned rail service has been hailed as having tremendous potential to improve economic co-operation in the region.
According to Slovenian officials, the train is "one of the most important steps in the establishing of a European rail network in cargo traffic". 
It will depart from Ljubljana for Belgrade on Wednesdays and return to Ljubljana on Thursdays -- a round-trip journey of 14 hours.
Slovenia and Croatia are among the countries taking an active part in the privatisation of Serbian companies, and the cargo train is expected to transport large quantities of goods. 
In the past year, total exports from Slovenia to Serbia have increased 75 per cent, while imports from Serbia to Slovenia have risen by 395 per cent.
Representatives of the three railroads project that more than a million tonnes of goods will be transported on the line by the end of this year. 
In 2005, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia expect traffic of around 1.5 million tonnes of goods by rail.
The head of the ZTP Beograd railway, Milenko Sarancic, announced that the new train would start running on 1 October. 
Two other cargo trains may be introduced six months later, he added.
Croatian railroad Director Tomislav Mlinaric said the deal is of great importance and will boost his country's use of railroads. 
Slovenian railroad Director Blaz Miklasic, meanwhile, said the introduction of daily cargo trains could be on the agenda of talks next year.

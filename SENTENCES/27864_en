PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Authorities on Saturday (April 24th) continued removing transmitters of Belgrade-based mobile operators in Kosovo, dismantling operations in Strpce and Kamenica. 
Serbian media reported that a transmitter of the local TV and Radio station Herc in Strpce was also removed. 
The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Kosovo explained they are thwarting Serbian operators who have no permission to operate in Kosovo and pay no taxes. 
On Friday, authorities shut down 14 base stations of Serbian mobile operators in central Kosovo, leaving thousands of Serbs without service.
Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic describes the move as an attempt to put Kosovo Serbs in isolation, while Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic warned of potential tension over the situation. 
According to Belgrade, Serbian mobile operators were granted open-ended licences for transmission in Kosovo long before 1999.
On Saturday, a transmitter owned by Kosovo mobile operator IPKO was damaged in the village of Rudare, in Zvecan municipality, triggering condemnations from both KFOR and the Kosovo government.

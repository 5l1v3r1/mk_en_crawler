EU Commissioner for Environment Stavros Dimas warned last week that Greece would face "serious problems" if it does not reduce its use of high-polluting fossil fuels such as lignite coal and shift to cleaner energy resources.

The EU average is 8.5 tonnes. 
That makes Greece the second worst-offender in terms of CO2 emissions, behind Portugal.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Lateness in implementing some EU reforms will be reflected in the upcoming European Commission (EC) progress report on Bulgaria, EU Integration Minister Meglena Kuneva said Thursday (29 September). 
Commenting on her latest consultations in Brussels, Kuneva stressed that, if constructive, the EC critics could give a boost to implementation of the most urgent reforms. 
However, she conceded the country has no reserve plan if EU entry is postponed beyond 2007.
In other news Thursday, Defence Minister Veselin Bliznakov said the army urgently needs 850m euros for modernisation. 
Out of 34 project proposals, the ministry has selected the five most pressing ones, including the purchase of new helicopter and transport vehicles as well as an upgrade of military aircraft and part of the marine fleet.

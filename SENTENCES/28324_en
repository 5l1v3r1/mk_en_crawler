ATHENS, Greece -- The Supreme Court has turned down Serbia's request for the extradition of Simeon Vilovski, a close associate of Bishop Artemije.
Vilovski's lawyer, Branislav Tapuskovic, said on Tuesday (July 13th) that his client has been released.
Vilovski was arrested on March 11th in Thessaloniki, based on a Serbian arrest warrant.
The cleric is suspected of embezzling 350,000 euros intended for the reconstruction of monasteries in Kosovo.
Serbia's justice ministry says it has not been informed officially of the Greek court's decision.

On July 11th, 775 victims of the Srebrenica genocide were finally laid to rest. 
On the 15th anniversary of the atrocity, their families buried them with grief and mourning, and in a sense, relief at being able to reach some form of closure. 
Many others are still waiting to find their loved ones.
In our audio story this week, we present a report by SETimes contributor Ljiljana Smiljanic.

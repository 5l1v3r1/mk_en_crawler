PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two Serbs were seriously wounded in separate incidents in Mitrovica early Monday (26 December).
Branislav Antovic, 35, was shot three times by an unknown attacker, in a parking lot in the north of the city where he worked as a guard, according to a local police spokesman.
Dejan Maksimovic, 24, was shot in the leg on the balcony of his home in the same area of the city.
Both were reported in stable condition.
Though police said there were no indications the attacks were ethnically motivated, officials in Belgrade and within the Serb community in Kosovo condemned the attacks as new attempts to force Serbs out of the province.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Thousands of people commemorated the second anniversary of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink's murder Monday (January 19th). 
They gathered outside the weekly Agos in Istanbul's central Sisli district, where a teenaged gunman -- angered by Dink's articles calling for better relations between Turkey and Armenia -- killed the newspaper's editor-in-chief on January 19th 2007. 
On Sunday, a ceremony at the Armenian Church of the Virgin Mary marked the anniversary. 
On Saturday, admirers of Dink released white pigeons in the central Anatolian province of Eskisehir.

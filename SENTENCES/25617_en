ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament began discussions late on Saturday (December 19th) on the country's 2010 budget, and aimed to find a way out of the current financial crisis.
"This first step is one of the most complicated moments in our recent historyâ€¦ In a moment of unprecedented crisis that has hit the country we need national unity between parties, public institutions, businesses, workers," said Prime Minister George Papandreou.
He said that rating agencies that lowered their assessments of Greece's solvency are undermining the government's efforts to stabilise the economy.
In December, Standard & Poor's and Fitch downgraded Greece's sovereign rating due to the country's huge budget deficit and public debts.
Speaking in Copenhagen on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference last week, Papandreou urged Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, whose country will take over the EU's rotating presidency in January, to look into the policies of rating agencies.

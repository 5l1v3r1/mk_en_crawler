BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The leader of the Sandzak Democratic Party, Rasim Ljajic, who also serves as Serbia-Montenegro's human and minority rights minister, said on Saturday (6 May) that his party objects to the further postponement of a referendum on removing Novi Pazar Mayor Sulejman Ugljanin from office. 
The municipal election commission in Novi Pazar is delaying the poll from 14 May to 25 June, citing insufficient time to prepare. 
Ljajic, however, criticised the decision as politically motivated and illegal and insisted his party would work to hold the referendum this month, as originally planned.
In mid-April, Ljajic resigned from the post of government co-ordinator for southern Serbia, to protest the Serbian government's move to dissolve the Novi Pazar municipal assembly and block the referendum on Ugljanin. 
The leader of the List of Sandzak movement is one of Ljajic's main political opponents.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US Embassy in Sarajevo said on Tuesday (March 4th) that Washington has decided to suspend financial support for Republika Srpska's (RS) ruling party, the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD).
The SNSD had benefited from different programmes financed by the USAID, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute.
But the embassy says the SNSD no longer meets the criteria for financial assistance.
USAID, it said, "does not provide financial or technical support to any ethnically-based, nationalist political parties in BiH, as their agendas are inconsistent with BiH's Euro-Atlantic path".
The decision follows a resolution by the SNSD-led RS parliament, which condemned Kosovo's independence and threatened to secede from BiH.
In response, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said if the United States aims to exert pressure or seek obedience from the SNSD, it will not succeed.

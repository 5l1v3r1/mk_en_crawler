SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg has denied accusations of involvement in an Italian royal corruption scandal involving his cousin, Italian Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel.
Speaking to Italy's La Stampa, he said he was "offended" by claims he might have taken a bribe to secure state procurement contracts in Bulgaria on behalf of Emmanuel and related Italian businesses.
Italian media reports have alleged the two men were linked to schemes involving the construction of a children's hospital and telecommunications projects in Bulgaria.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Serbs in a northern Mitrovica neighbourhood started rebuilding five houses Wednesday (May 13th), closely monitored by EULEX officials.
The situation seems to be calm, in contrast to periods over the past two weeks, when Serbs had protested repairs to homes owned by ethnic Albanians situated in the Serb part of the divided town.
EULEX personnel used tear gas and stun grenades at times to prevent clashes between the Serbs and Albanians.
EULEX says no one other than workers will be allowed to approach the construction sites.

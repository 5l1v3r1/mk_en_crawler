SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Health Minister Anna-Maria Borissova resigned on Wednesday (September 29th) amid heavy criticism against planned reforms in the sector. 
The public uproar was spurred by government plans to force patients to pay for hospital treatment, in addition to making mandatory health contributions from their salaries. 
The plan is part of the Concept for Bulgaria's Healthcare in 2010-2015, which was recently published on the health ministry's website. 
Borissova was appointed to the post in early April after predecessor Bozhidar Nanev resigned amid accusations of approving medicine deals that harmed the state budget.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic announced on Sunday (1 August) that local government elections would take place on 19 September.

Mayors and assembly presidents will be elected directly by a simple majority.
Markovic says he believes the local elections bill must be improved, but only after a new amendment to the constitution is adopted.

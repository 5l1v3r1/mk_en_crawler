THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- No political agreement on immunity from prosecution could save war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic from trial because such an agreement would be invalid under international law, The Hague tribunal said in a statement Thursday (December 18th).
Karadzic earlier asked the judges to terminate proceedings against him based on his alleged deal with US diplomat Richard Holbrooke in July 1996, which, he claims, guaranteed he would not face the UN tribunal if he left politics.
Holbrooke, a former US peace envoy, has denied making any such deal.
Meanwhile, Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz reiterated calls Thursday to Serbian authorities to arrest former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic so he could be tried together with Karadzic.
He added that it is possible to apprehend and extradite Mladic to The Hague before Karadzic's trial begins.
Mladic's arrest is also the main condition for ratifying Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

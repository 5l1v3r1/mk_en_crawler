SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The fight against corruption should be the highest priority not only to the government, but also to all Macedonian citizens, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski told a local forum Thursday (10 April).
There can be no political stability, economic improvement, democracy, or European perspectives in a corrupt country, Crvenkovski added.
He vowed his government would do everything possible to eliminate the problem.

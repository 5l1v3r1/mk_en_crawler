SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) announced Saturday (19 April) it would freeze its participation in parliament for an unspecified period.
DPA leader Arben Xhaferi said the move was to protest the stalled debate on provisions of the Ohrid peace accord.
Earlier in the day, he had offered to step down as party leader, but DPA members refused to accept his resignation.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, meanwhile, described the walkout as an effort to destabilise the peace process.
The DPA is the second largest Albanian party in Macedonia.
In other news, Skopje Mayor Risto Penov was re-elected chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party at its second national congress Saturday.
He will serve four years.

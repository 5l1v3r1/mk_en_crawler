PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Week one of the EULEX deployment has been successful, agreed mission chief Yves de Kermabon and Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci on Wednesday (December 17th).
Kuci said the deployment is significant in establishing the rule of law, especially in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.
Meanwhile, on Thursday Human Rights Watch called on EULEX to urgently investigate cases of ethnically motivated crimes and crimes committed during the conflict in Kosovo.
In a letter to de Kermabon, the organisation said the EU mission should prepare a strategy that treats the most sensitive cases as a priority.
It specifically cited those linked to the March 2004 riots and those involving war crimes during the conflict that ended in 1999.
In other news, NATO's chief of defence, Admiral Giampaolo di Paola, said on Wednesday that NATO is doing its job in preparing to establish the Kosovo Security Forces (KSF), but there are delays beyond its control.
"The Kosovar side has to do its part of the work too.
Kosovar institutions have not appointed the KSF commander yet," di Paola was quoted as saying by the daily Koha Ditore.

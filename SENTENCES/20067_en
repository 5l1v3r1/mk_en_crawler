ANKARA, Turkey -- The ban on women wearing headscarves in universities and government institutions may be removed before related amendments to the constitution are adopted, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday (January 16th). 
He added that wearing a headscarf is a matter of personal freedom and suggested that the issue could be settled through consensus. 
Supporters of the secular founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, view the headscarf as a symbol that threatens the secular principles of the state.

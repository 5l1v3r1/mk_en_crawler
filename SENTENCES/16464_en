SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Once Bulgaria becomes an EU member next year, it will offer free visas to Macedonian citizens, Bulgarian Ambassador to Skopje Miho Mihov said on Tuesday (8 August). 
An agreement on visas was reached during talks in May. 
In addition, Mihov said, visa requirements for students, business community members and journalists will be eased. 
Bulgaria plans to open a consulate in Bitola to facilitate travel between the two countries.

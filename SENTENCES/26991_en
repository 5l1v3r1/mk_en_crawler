PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A petition against the "political" trial of Vetevendosje (Self Determination) movement leader Albin Kurti has been signed by 145,000 citizens, organisers of the petition drive announced on Sunday (March 7th).
Kurti has refused to attend court sessions led by EULEX judges, saying he "does not recognise the judges working for a mission that does not recognise Kosovo".
He faces charges stemming from a protest in February 2007 that turned violent, leaving two protestors dead and dozens injured.
The petition calls for an investigation into the events of February 2007.
Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi is being asked to call a special session regarding the case.
The signatures were collected in 28 municipalities over a period of 19 days.

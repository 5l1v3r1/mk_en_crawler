SKOPJE, Macedonia -- From a military point of view, the security situation in Macedonia is stable, allowing for the withdrawal of the EU military mission Concordia. 
That was the conclusion of a Concordia representative, stated at a press conference in Tetovo on Tuesday (25 November). 
The mission's mandate expires on 15 December, at which point it will be replaced by the EU police mission Proxima.
In other news Tuesday, President Boris Trajkovski confirmed that five top generals are retiring. 
The move came at NATO's recommendation, in line with efforts to modernise the army.

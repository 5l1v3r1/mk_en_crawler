SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Terrorism and organised crime know no boundaries, requiring countries in Southeast Europe to fight them together, participants in a two-day conference dubbed "Balkans against Terrorism" agreed in a joint declaration Thursday (October 28th). 
Gurbuz Bahadir, director of the Southeast European Co-operative Initiative, stressed the importance of society in fighting terror and organised crime, pointing out that this is not only a task for authorities.
Separately, Europol Assistant Director Laszlo Salgo announced on Thursday the creation of a special unit to deal with organised crime in the Western Balkans. 
He stressed the region is sensitive because it is often a source and a transit point for criminal activities. 
Therefore, he announced Europol is forming a new unit to deal with crime in Southeast Europe. 
He added that in the future, an analytical unit to deal with collecting intelligence information from this region may be established. 
Salgo was speaking on the sidelines of a Brussels conference on fighting organised crime and corruption in the Balkans, organised by the Serbian Justice Ministry.

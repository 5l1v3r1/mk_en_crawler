SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A report by EU experts describes the reform of Bulgaria's judiciary as chaotic and nonconforming to EU standards. 
The paper says the most recent laws were of "relatively low technical quality" and "not sufficiently operable". 
Referring to new constitutional amendments, the experts concluded that the way they were drafted "is a clear sign of the lack of structure and vision in implementing a legal reform strategy".
However, the findings do not mean that Bulgaria's accession to the EU would be delayed, said Susette Schuster, the report's lead author. 
Schuster, a German judge formerly based in Bulgaria for the EU, said a decision to keep Sofia out of the EU would have to be backed by all 25 members of the EU -- a highly unlikely development.
Belgium's Parliament, meanwhile, ratified the accession treaty for both Bulgaria and Romania on Thursday, moving the process further ahead.

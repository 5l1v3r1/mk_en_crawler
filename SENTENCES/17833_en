PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Hague war crimes tribunal Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte failed to convince the Trial Chamber to ban a meeting between former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj and UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker, scheduled for Friday (February 23rd).
Del Ponte explained she fears the Haradinaj-Ruecker meeting would make other witnesses change their mind about testifying at his trial, because they would fear UNMIK backs Haradinaj and would not provide them proper protection.
Proceedings against Haradinaj, charged with war crimes against Kosovo Serbs in 1999, are due to begin on March 5th.

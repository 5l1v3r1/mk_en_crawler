BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Thursday (December 28th) welcomed Bulgaria and Romania as the EU's newest members. 
The two countries will officially join the Union on Monday. 
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso issued a statement hailing the historic nature of the event. 
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said membership would bring significant improvements to the everyday lives of all Bulgarians and Romanians. 
He and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country takes over the rotating EU presidency on Monday, will attend celebrations in Sofia and Bucharest. 
Bulgaria and Romania applied for EU membership in 1995. 
Their Accession Treaty was signed in April 2005.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu tried to lower expectations somewhat on Thursday, saying it could take up to 40 years for Romania to catch up -- economically and politically -- with the old members of the EU. 
Steady economic growth and political stability could cut that time in half, he added.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski formally handed the mandate for forming a new government to Prime Minister-designate Hari Kostov on Friday (14 May).
Kostov has 20 days to present the list of new cabinet members to parliament.
He says he will have it ready far sooner, as the ruling Social Democrat Alliance of Macedonia has already consulted with its political partners - the Liberal Democratic Party and the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration.
The only expected change would be at the interior ministry, which Kostov previously led.

ATHENS, Greece -- Thousands of Albanian migrants, returning to Greece after spending the Christmas and New Year's holidays at home, spent hours at the Kakavia border checkpoint with Albania after a problem in the Greek telco OTE's network caused authorities to suspend the processing of passports for over nine hours. 
According to media reports, the queues of cars and buses stretched several kilometres.
In other news, Greece announced on Tuesday (January 2nd) that it is temporarily closing the busy Corinth Canal, which connects the Ionian and Aegean Sea. 
The waterway will be shut for at least a week, following a landslide.

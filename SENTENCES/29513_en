PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says Kosovo institutions -- not EULEX -- should take the lead in fighting high level corruption.
He praised steps already under way in that direction.
"The determination and statements of the chief prosecutor that sensitive cases are among the 111 cases that are to be reviewed, is encouraging," Thaci said on Monday (May 31st) after meeting with chief prosecutor Ismet Kabashi, acting Police Director Behar Selimi and Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi.
"I have emphasised that Kosovo institutions will lead the fight against corruption, organised crime and all other negative phenomena," Thaci said, adding that the international authorities, such as EULEX, should facilitate, support and monitor the process.

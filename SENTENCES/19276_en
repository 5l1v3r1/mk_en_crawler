BRUSSELS, Belgium -- After a heated debate on Croatia's EU-related progress Tuesday (February 26th), the European Parliament's (EP) foreign policy committee tabled a compromise regarding Zagreb's protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic. 
The zone has caused a rift among Italy, Slovenia, Croatia and the European Commission. 
Under the new proposal, Croatia might be allowed to preserve the environmental conditions -- that is, limit fishing only in case of environmental threats. 
But the country would not be able to otherwise restrict access by fishermen from Italy and Slovenia.
EP Rapporteur for Croatia Hannes Swoboda said it would be a pity if Croatia's EU accession talks were hindered by a "relatively unimportant issue" such as the ZERP.

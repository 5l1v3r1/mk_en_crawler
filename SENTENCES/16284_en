ANKARA, Turkey -- The US special co-ordinator for the fight against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), retired General Joseph Ralston, vowed in Ankara on Wednesday (13 September) that effective measures against the PKK would be undertaken in close collaboration with Turkey and Iraq. 
Ralston's comment followed a meeting with his newly appointed Turkish counterpart, retired General Edip Baser. 
While voicing Washington's determination to combat any kind of terrorism, Ralston reiterated a warning against any unilateral military action by Turkey in northern Iraq.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities culled thousands of domestic birds on Sunday (16 October) in an attempt to stop an outbreak of bird flu.
Access to two villages where infected fowl were found has been restricted.
Authorities have ordered farmers not to allow animals into the open and have vowed to fine violators.
A British laboratory is testing new samples from dead birds collected at a different location in Romania, though no new cases of the disease have been established to date.
Romania plans to discuss the matter with neighbouring countries -- particularly Bulgaria and Ukraine.
About 100,000 people in the infected areas in Romania have been vaccinated against the virus.
In Turkey, meanwhile, officials announced that a similar outbreak has been contained.
Tests of 1,000 recently culled birds have not shown evidence of the disease.

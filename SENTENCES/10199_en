NOVI SAD, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said Sunday (26 September) that his Democratic Party (DS) would support only democratic and pro-European candidates in the second round of local elections. 
During a visit to Novi Sad, Tadic declared that DS would not back extremism, radicalism and those who want to drag Serbia backwards.
In other news, the chairman of Serbia-Montenegro's national council for co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, warned on Friday that the panel's work has been effectively blocked due to the departure of its Montenegrin members. 
Ljajic criticised the timing of the move, days ahead of a visit by UN war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.

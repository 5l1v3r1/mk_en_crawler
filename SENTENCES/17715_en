ANKARA Turkey -- The government has renovated an ancient church as a goodwill gesture to Armenia and its own Armenian minority.
A symbol of the Armenians' presence in Turkey, the Akdamar Church has stood on a rocky island in the middle of Lake Van for 1,000 years.
Its condition deteriorated significantly during the last century.
Armenian officials have been invited to attend the unveiling Thursday (March 29th).
Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian welcomed the move but urged Ankara to do more to strengthen bilateral relations.
He called for reopening the two countries' mutual border, which has been closed since 1993.

Police on 15 September arrested Serbian Supreme Court judge Ljubomir Vuckovic and Deputy Special Prosecutor for Organised Crime Milan Radovanovic, on respective charges of bribery and divulging official secrets.
The two were placed in pre-trial detention for 30 days, after the Serbian Parliament canceled their immunity at an emergency session on 17 September.
Vuckovic stands accused of taking bribes in exchange for agreeing to release members of the so-called Krusevac criminal group from prison.
He allegedly planned to adopt an appeal from the group's lawyer, after which the verdict against them was to be annulled and the group released.
The criminal group was sentenced before a first-degree court in November 2004.
Group leader Zoran Jotic received a 12-year sentence and is now in Belgrade's central jail.
Serbian police say that Jotic contacted Vuckovic via mediators and promised him money in return for freedom.
The amount, according to Belgrade media reports, totaled as much as 400,000 euros.
Vuckovic is said to have offered part of that sum to two other Supreme Court judges to secure their backing for his decisions.
For the time being, however, Vuckovic is the only judge to have been arrested.
Police discovered the plot through wiretapping Jotic's phone conversations from prison.
Apart from the judge and prosecutor, three other people suspected of involvement have also been detained.
Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic praised the police officers who participated in the sting.
"I especially want to stress that our primary goal is to bring to justice all who think that position or money make them untouchable by the law," Jocic said on 16 September.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said that the arrest of the judge and the deputy special prosecutor "will strengthen state institutions, because the government has taken on the obligation of rooting out corruption."

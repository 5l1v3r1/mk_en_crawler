BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic and his Serbia-Montenegro counterpart, Svetozar Marovic, had a phone conversation Wednesday (18 May), during which they agreed that bilateral ties remained stable, according to a statement from Marovic's office.
The two spoke after Mesic cancelled his visit to Belgrade earlier this week due to Serbian support for a gathering of Chetnik sympathisers.
Marovic said he hoped the two states would continue maintaining normal relations at all levels.

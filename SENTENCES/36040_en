TIRANA, Albania -- Minister of Public Order Igli Toska urged Southeast European countries to step up co-operation in the fight against drug trafficking.
Meeting with US Ambassador to Tirana James Jeffrey on Thursday (25 March), Toska agreed that drug trafficking is the largest source of financing for terrorist organisations in the region and that eliminating the problem is crucial to global efforts against terrorism.
The two officials attended the graduation ceremony of Albania's anti-drug unit.
In other news Thursday, the opposition Republican Party demanded a revision of the election law, saying it discriminates against smaller parties and is drafted solely to defend the interests of the ruling Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party.

PORTO CARRAS, Greece -- The leaders of the 15 EU member-states promised their counterparts from the Western Balkans that the doors of the Union remain open to them.
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro received assurances on Saturday (21 June) that they would be able to join the Union as soon as they meet the criteria for membership.
The five countries were also promised an extra $240m in assistance to speed up their integration.
EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten said the prospect of membership is real and the map of the Union would be incomplete without the Western Balkans.
Separately, EU security chief Javier Solana sent a letter to Serbia-Montenegro and neighbouring Western Balkan countries.
Published Saturday in the Serbian daily <I>Politika</I>, his letter urged the governments to speed up reforms in the areas of judiciaries, security, economic policies, and institution building.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown called on Wednesday (20 April) for completion of the Srebrenica Commission's work by 31 May. 
In a letter to Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic, Ashdown acknowledged the panel's final report, submitted in late March, as a serious piece of work. 
However, he said, the report was incomplete and did not meet all the requirements set by him last December, mainly because of insufficient co-operation by the interior and defence ministries of the Bosnian Serb entity.
Meanwhile, BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic is ordering RS army recruits in Manjaca and Bileca to repeat a ceremony in which they are to swear allegiance to BiH. 
Last weekend, the recruits caused an uproar by taking an oath only to RS.

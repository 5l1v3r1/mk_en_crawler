TIRANA, Albania -- The Public Health Institute has registered nine new cases of the swine flu virus in Albania, including two children and a patient in serious condition. 
Tests have been sent to Romania for further analyses, local media reported Thursday (August 27th). 
The Institute is urging paediatric units in hospitals across Albania to be more careful with their young patients, as they are more exposed to the H1N1 virus. 
Another 21 cases of swine flu were reported earlier this month.

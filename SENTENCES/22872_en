THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced on Monday (October 6th) that he has asked The Hague war crimes tribunal to provide him with all documents related to a proposal former US special envoy for the Balkans Richard Holbrooke allegedly made to him.
According to Karadzic, Holbrooke promised him in July 1996 that the UN tribunal would not prosecute him if he gave up politics.
Karadzic insists that access to all documents related to this agreement will help him deflect the war crimes charges against him.
Karadzic also requested documents related in part to US efforts in the peace talks in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1995 and 1997, relations between the United States and the UN, and documents referring to UN policy.

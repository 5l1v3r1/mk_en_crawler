ATHENS, Greece -- A bomb rattled the Athens offices of the Hellenic Public Real Estate Corporation late Thursday (March 19th), police said.
The device was detonated remotely from a short distance and attackers had visual contact with their target to avoid hurting anyone, police said.
The targeted corporation was recently involved in a corruption scandal over an improper real-estate deal that caused 100m euros in losses to the state.
In other news, media reported Friday that a previously unknown terror group calling itself Revolutionary Liberation Action claimed responsibility for a firebomb attack on the office of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, parliament member from the ruling New Democracy.
The explosion caused minor damage but no injuries.
Police suggested his recent criticisms of street riots causing material damage in Athens on March 13th may have prompted the attack.

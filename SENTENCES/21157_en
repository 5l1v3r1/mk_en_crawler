PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament approved on Friday (February 29th) the new government led by Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic of the Democratic Party of Socialists This is Djukanovic's fifth term as a prime minister. 
He succeeds Zeljko Sturanovic, who was diagnosed with cancer and resigned in late January.
A bomb scare at parliament Thursday delayed a vote on Djukanovic's cabinet and programme until Friday. 
Representatives of the opposition pro-Serb parties said they would not attend that session, and called on Djukanovic to announce whether his government will recognise Kosovo. 
Djukanovic says the decision depends on national interests.

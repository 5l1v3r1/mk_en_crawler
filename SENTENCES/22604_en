BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Tuesday (April 8th) that Romania benefited greatly from hosting the biggest summit in NATO's history last week. 
At a defence ministry session, Basescu cited as an example the anti-missile defence shield backed by NATO members last week. 
He noted it would protect the country from ballistic missiles launched from the Middle East.

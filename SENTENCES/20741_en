ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the coalition of the Croatian Peasant Party and Social Liberal Party (HSS-HSLS) have failed to reach a final coalition agreement, the three parties announced on Friday (December 7th) at a press conference.
However, talks will continue, and a new press conference has been scheduled for Wednesday.
The representatives of the HDZ, Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec, and the HSS, Bozidar Pankretic, stressed that the greater part of policy issues have already been agreed upon, and much less remained on the table.

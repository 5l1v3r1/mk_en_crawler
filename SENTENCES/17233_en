SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After a four-month boycott, the parliamentary caucus of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) rejoined their colleagues on Wednesday (May 30th).
In his address, DUI co-ordinator Rafiz Aliti said that the group returned to Parliament after the party reached an agreement in talks with the ruling VMRO-DPMNE.
When opposition parties insisted on details, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the DUI and VMRO-DPMNE orally agreed on some 46 laws to be voted under the Badinter Principle, as well as on some changes in Parliament's Ethnic Communities Relations Committee.
But DUI says it was a written agreement, which it will soon publish.
In other news Wednesday, Education Minister Sulejman Rushiti began a three-day official visit to Albania.
He and Albanian counterpart Genz Polo will discuss strengthening educational and scientific co-operation.

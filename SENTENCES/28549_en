SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Tax authorities and prosecutors used a helicopter Wednesday (October 13th) to search for tax evaders and their luxurious holiday homes along the Black Sea coast. 
The flight revealed about 200 villas whose owners will now be checked for tax evasion, the National Revenue Agency announced. 
Earlier this week, local television channels broadcast helicopter footage of luxurious properties in the suburbs of Sofia and the central city of Plovdiv, as well as a whole illegal complex on state-owned land near a dam in Ivaylovgrad. 
The complex is believed to be owned by customs officials. 
The helicopter method was chosen to obtain a peek at what is behind the tall walls of many of the properties belonging to high-profile politicians and state officials. 
Local authorities say some of these estates are still listed in state registries as under construction, a trick owners use to avoid taxes. 
Others are listed as owned by companies, which means expenses can serve as deductions.

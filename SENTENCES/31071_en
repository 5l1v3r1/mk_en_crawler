ANKARA, Turkey -- A mass grave has been discovered in a field in southeast Turkey, local media reported on Wednesday (January 5th).
The grave is believed to contain the remains of Kurds who went missing in the 1990s.
The bones of eight people have been unearthed so far.
A prosecutor ordered the excavations in Bitlis province after a tip from the families of nine Kurds who disappeared shortly after they left their villages to join the Kurdish rebels.
DNA tests will be conducted to determine whether those are the missing Kurds.
Authorities say the grave may contain more remains.

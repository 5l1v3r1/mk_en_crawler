ATHENS, Greece -- Turkey's EU prospects and the overall situation in the Balkans were the focus of Thursday's (29 September) meeting of the National Council for Foreign Policy. 
Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis said such meetings represent an opportunity for the government and opposition to exchange views about foreign affairs. 
He noted that participants managed to agree on foreign policy priorities, though not on how to achieve them. 
The opposition reiterated its support for Turkey's EU accession, but stressed the process should contain deadlines and precise safeguard clauses to protect Greek interests.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Discussions between the IMF and Turkey on its Letter of Intent continue, but the time has not yet come to schedule an IMF Board meeting on the 4th review, according to IMF External Relations Director Thomas Dawson.
During a news conference Tuesday (4 March), he dismissed any links between the status of a proposed US aid package and the Fund's stand-by programme.
Turkish Economy Minister Ali Babacan says he believes the Board will meet by the end of this month or in mid-April at the latest.
The 4th review of the stand-by agreement would result in the release of a $1.6 billion loan instalment.

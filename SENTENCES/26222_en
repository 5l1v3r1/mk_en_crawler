ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Saturday (December 12th) that authorities will comply with the UN war crimes tribunal's order to stop examining documents and computers seized in a police operation last week. 
It involved raids on the homes of General Ante Gotovina's defence team, who then threatened to walk out of the trial saying their rights had been violated. 
According to The Hague ruling, the seized documents cannot be viewed by unauthorised personnel. 
Police were searching for the so-called "artillery diaries", documents related to 1995's Operation Storm. 
Authorities say the effort turned up more than 10,000 classified documents and maps. 
Croatia's co-operation with the UN tribunal is key to the country's EU integration.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police in Kursumlija arrested Hadzi Andrej Milic, leader of the Tsar Lazar Guard paramilitary group, on Wednesday (November 28th), after 20 members of the organisation ignored a ban and gathered for a rally near the St. 
Nikola monastery. 
Milic was detained along with two supporters.
On Wednesday, a group of NGOs in Serbia requested an outright ban on activities by the Guard and similar groups in Serbia.

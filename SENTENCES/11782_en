BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EUFOR is investigating alleged irregularities during the oath-swearing ceremony for Croat recruits joining the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Army, held at the Capljina barracks on Friday (17 June). 
According to a report in Nezavisne novine's weekend editions, Croatia's national anthem was played along with the BiH one, contrary to instructions from BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic to his FBiH counterpart Miroslav Nikolic before the ceremony. 
The Office of the High Representative says it was informed of EUFOR's probe and would comment after it is completed. 
Western officials were outraged by the behaviour of recruits at two oath-swearing ceremonies in Republika Srpska earlier this year.

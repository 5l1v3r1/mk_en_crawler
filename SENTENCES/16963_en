ATHENS, Greece -- The leader of the main opposition party PASOK, George Papandreou, again raised the possibility of early parliamentary elections, during a meeting of his party's parliamentary caucus Tuesday (October 3rd). 
Papandreou expressed concern over the direction Greece is heading, accusing the current New Democracy-led government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis of failing to combat corruption. 
He described the October 15th local elections as a "crucial battle" his party must win.

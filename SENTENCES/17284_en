ANKARA, Turkey -- Afghani President Hamid Karzai and his Pakistani counterpart, Pervez Musharraf, are holding bilateral talks in Ankara on Monday (April 30th), seeking to strengthen ties and discuss joint measures against the Taliban. 
Each side has been blaming the other for failing to contain the militants. 
This marks Turkey's second major effort in a week to serve as a facilitator. 
Last week, EU security chief Javier Solana and Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, wrapped up two days of talks in Ankara, focused on Iran's nuclear programme.

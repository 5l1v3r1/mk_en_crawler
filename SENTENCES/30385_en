ANKARA, Turkey -- Political parties submitted on their final candidate lists Monday (April 11th) for the June 12th general elections.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) retained less than half of its current lawmakers in the new list, as it seeks to recast its image.
Though Prime Minister and AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan had suggested he'd be scrapping several key party figures who have already served two terms in parliament, only Minister for Women and Family Affairs Selma Aliye Kavaf was left off the nomination lists.
Erdogan changed the electoral districts of some prominent figures, moving a number of ministers to coastal areas where support for AKP is modest.
The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) lists indicate that leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu attempted a clean slate, leaving off 78 out of the 101 current party lawmakers.
Former party leader Deniz Baykal was nominated, along with some in his circle, but hardliner and influential Secretary General Onder Sav and his team were omitted.
The CHP also nominated three suspects in the ongoing Ergenekon coup case.
Nationalist Movement Party leader Devlet Bahceli nominated some key figures from the centre-right to attract new voters.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament failed Saturday (1 March) to approve a motion that would have allowed the United States to deploy more than 60,000 troops for a possible operation against Iraq. 
Initially, it was announced that the government's proposal had been approved. 
Minutes later, however, House Speaker Bulent Arinc announced that out of 533 members present for the vote, 264 had supported the motion, 250 voted against it and 19 abstained. 
That was three votes short of the required simple majority. 
The vote had been delayed while the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) tried to muster enough support among its deputies. 
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said he would summon AKP members on Sunday, to try to convince them to support the measure if reintroduced this week. 
Turkey stands to lose a multi-billion dollar US aid package aimed at shoring up a frail economy, recovering from its deepest recession since 1945. 
A $16 billion IMF loan package could also be in jeopardy.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Tuesday (9 May) that the EC would not defer its recommendation on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
There has been media speculation that the decision on whether the two countries should join the union in January 2007 would be delayed until October.
Barroso said the EC would make its recommendation to member-states, together with its progress reports on the two countries, on 16 May as originally planned.
Also Tuesday, Sweden became the 16th country in the 25-member bloc to ratify Bulgaria and Romania's accession treaty.

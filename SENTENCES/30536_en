SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Hundreds of former soldiers gathered on Wednesday (February 16th) outside parliament in Sarajevo seeking promised pensions.
Organiser Senad Hubijer said that out of 1,800 soldiers demobilised last year, about 1,400 meet conditions for early retirement.
Deputy Finance Minister Fuad Kasumovic, who met representatives of the protestors, said the defence ministry will publish a list Friday, identifying soldiers who were discharged from service last year and data about funds needed for their pensions.
Kasumovic says the finance ministry will include these funds in the 2011 budget projections.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Regular autumn economic forecasts from the European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (26 October) suggest the EC doubts that proposed government measures aimed at cutting Greece's budget deficit to below the EU ceiling by next year will work.
According to the Commission, the main target for 2005 -- reducing the budget deficit from a projected 5.3 per cent in 2004 to 2.8 per cent of GDP -- might be unattainable.

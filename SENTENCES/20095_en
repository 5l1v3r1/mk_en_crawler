SOFIA, Bulgaria -- An hour-long warning strike marked the first day of school Saturday (September 15th) in many schools across the country. 
Teachers are demanding a 100% pay rise beginning in January. 
So far, the best the government has offered is 10% beginning in the middle of next year. 
Union calls for a day-long walkout were rejected by teachers themselves, who didn't want to ruin the day for their students. 
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov has offered to mediate the dispute between the teachers and the education ministry.

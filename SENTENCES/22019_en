SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Around a dozen of peace organisations from Macedonia and Greece held a joint rally in Skopje on Saturday (May 17th), criticising the rise of nationalism in both countries.
They also urged the members of the public in both countries to show more tolerance and co-operation.
One of the aims of the rally was to show that there is an alternative to political conflicts, such as the long-standing name dispute between the two countries.

WASHINGTON, United States -- Ammunitions dealer Efraim Diveroli has pleaded guilty to conspiracy at a court in Miami, Florida, local media reported on Monday (August 31st). 
Diveroli's company, AEY, had a contract with the Pentagon worth about 207m euros, to supply Afghanistan with ammunition he bought in Albania. 
The contract explicitly barred AEY from shipping ammunition acquired directly or indirectly from a "Communist Chinese military company." However, AEY repackaged ammunition made in China to make it look as if it was produced in Albania, and sold it as such. 
Two other men working for the company also pleaded guilty. 
Questions first surfaced after an explosion at an ammunitions depot outside Tirana in March 2008 that killed 26 people and destroyed 300 buildings.

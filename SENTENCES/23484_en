SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The new cabinet met for the first time on Wednesday (July 29th), with Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov serving up some sobering news: he predicts the economy will shrink by 6.3% this year. 
He quoted the latest forecast from the Agency for Economic Analyses, as well as forecasts by his ministry. 
Experts say it will likely be the working forecast that the ministry will use from now on, in contrast to the 2.5% contraction expected by his predecessor, Plamen Oresharski. 
Dyankov added that his ministry would have to raise an additional 1.3 billion euros this year, half through spending cuts, half from tax collection.

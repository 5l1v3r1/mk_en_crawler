TIRANA, Albania -- Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu says the army has destroyed all of its anti-personnel mines and will eliminate all chemical agents by the end of the year as part of a programme to scrap excess weaponry by 2010. 
Speaking at a disarmament conference Thursday (20 April) in Tirana, Mediu said the army, with financial aid from other countries, had destroyed light weaponry, tanks and other transport equipment, artillery and ammunition. 
A huge amount of weapons, ammunition and explosive devices were looted from army depots in 1997, when members of the public, enraged over losing their life savings in bogus pyramid investment schemes, stormed army barracks. 
The government since has collected about 200,000 weapons and significant amounts of ordnance.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- At an official ceremony Thursday (1 September), Italian Lieutenant General Giuseppe Valotto took over command of KFOR from French Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon. 
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen praised the level of co-operation de Kermabon had shown, noting KFOR has gained confidence in itself since the March 2004 unrest. 
At the same time, however, he warned that there remain numerous short-term threats to stability, and called for an even higher level of alert. 
Serbian-Montenegrin Army Chief-of-Staff Dragan Paskas was among those attending the ceremony. 
It was his first visit to the province. 
Several Kosovo Albanian politicians boycotted the ceremony, objecting to his presence.

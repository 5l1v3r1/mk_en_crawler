BUCHAREST, Romania -- Pierre Cailleteau, an analyst with the international rating agency Moody's, said on Friday (28 October) that a delay of Romania and Bulgaria's EU membership by one year -- from 2007 to 2008 -- seems unlikely. 
Cailleteau commented that the latest monitoring reports from the European Commission were generally constructive in tone.

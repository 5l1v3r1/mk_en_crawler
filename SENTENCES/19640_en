TEHRAN, Iran -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Sunday (October 28th) that all options in the fight against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are "on the table". 
Babacan, who was visiting Iran, said Turkey has run out of patience in its efforts to curb the attacks by Kurdish militants. 
"We can use or continue to use diplomatic means, or resort to military means. 
All of these are on the table," Babacan said after a meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Manouchehr Mottaki, in Tehran. 
He reiterated Turkey had no claims to Iraq's territorial integrity and its sole goal was to target terrorist groups.
Mottaki said Iran "condemns recent terrorist (acts) by the PKK in Turkey and â¦ underlines the necessity of fighting against terrorism". 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, said Iran supports a possible military operation by Turkey but would prefer the conflict to be settled peacefully. 
He spoke by phone Saturday with Turkish President Abdullah Gul, and later with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.

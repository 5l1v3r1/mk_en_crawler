ZAGREB, Croatia -- The national councils of Croatia's main political powers -- the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- held sessions Saturday (21 May) to review the results of the 13 May municipal elections, which saw gains by the opposition.
At the HDZ meeting, party leader and incumbent Prime Minister Ivo Sanader dismissed suggestions that HDZ was losing voter support.
He said the party was in talks on possible coalitions.
After the SDP meeting, party leader Ivica Racan also said coalition scenarios were under consideration.

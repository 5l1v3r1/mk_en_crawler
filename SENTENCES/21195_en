PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- UNMIK and OSCE Mission officials in Pristina urged Serbs in Kosovo to participate in elections later this month, saying participation will ensure that their voice is heard. 
Wednesday's (October 31st) statement was in response to calls for a boycott from several senior Serbian officials. 
''There have been warnings of financial sanctions and reported individual threats towards Kosovo Serbs who run or vote in elections,'' an OSCE spokesman said. 
Officials said there were also cases of physical intimidation and warnings that those who participated in the election would be "lynched". 
The election is scheduled for November 17th.

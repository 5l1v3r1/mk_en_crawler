BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's democratic parties will try again Thursday (29 January) to choose a parliament speaker and form a cabinet.
Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) head Vojislav Kostunica says he will present a compromise to the others.
But local press is reporting that DSS could work together with Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists if talks with the democratic parties fail.
In other news, the heads of the Serbia-Montenegro Army and the defence ministry said Wednesday that the international community is satisfied with military reforms in the union, but pledged to step up the pace.

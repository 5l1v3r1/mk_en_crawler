ATHENS, Greece -- Public transport unions are launching a fresh wave of strikes Monday (January 31st) to protest a controversial law on restructuring state-owned companies. 
The subway system in Athens will stop for 24 hours, while buses will be off for five hours on Monday and 48 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Unions accuse the government of failing to take their proposals into consideration when preparing a draft that was submitted to parliament Friday. 
The legislation envisions scrapping 1,500 jobs in the public transport in Athens, as well as salary cuts. 
The measures are part of Greece's commitments under a 110 billion-euro bailout package it received from the EU and IMF last May.

WASHINGTON, United States -- At least three Balkan countries have become more democratic over the past decade, according to the 14th edition of the US-based NGO Freedom House's "Nations in Transit" report, published on Wednesday (June 30th). 
"Modest improvements" have been observed in Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo. 
The situations in Croatia and Montenegro are described as "steady overall". 
Freedom House says EU members Bulgaria and Romania continue to face challenges in efforts to combat corruption. 
The report cites a slight decline in Albania's media independence, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina there has been a downturn in terms of electoral processes.

BINGOL, Turkey -- Police fired into the air and fought running battles with protesters in the southeastern city of Bingol on Friday (2 May), as hope faded for as many as 70 children trapped in a flattened school.
Rescuers worked through the night, cutting into the floodlit wreckage of the dormitory demolished by Thursday's earthquake, which killed more than 100 people in the impoverished mountain area.
By morning, the bodies of 38 children and a teacher had been found.
Anger erupted, with more than 1,000 people marching on the governor's office.
Chanting "resign, resign", they accused him of failing to help them, and demanded more tents and food.
Police on the steps of the office fired long bursts from automatic weapons into the air.
Without criticising police, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan later announced that the local police chief had been fired.
Greece, meanwhile, announced that it would provide 300,000 euros worth of humanitarian aid and send 25 rescue workers to help search for victims.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has sent a team to evaluate Turkey's needs and help co-ordinate international assistance.
The Red Crescent is expected to provide 2,000 tents.

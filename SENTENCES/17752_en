SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign ministers of countries in the Central European Initiative (CEI) agreed on Friday (May 18th) to strengthen regional co-operation and increase collaboration with the EU. 
The CEI forum, held under the auspices of the current Bulgarian chairmanship, brought the top diplomats of 18 Central and Southeast European states to Sofia. 
They agreed that increased co-operation would be aimed at boosting the EU accession prospects of CEI states that are not yet members of the Union.

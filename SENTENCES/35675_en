BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said on Thursday (3 June) that police officers and army generals who have been charged with war crimes would be arrested sooner or later.
The real question, he says, is where they would face trial.
After a meeting in Berlin with EU officials, Labus said the issue of war crimes co-operation is "a stone around the neck", blocking relations with the Union and the United States.
In other news Thursday, the cabinet approved the defence strategy proposed by the defence ministry.
The key document, outlining army reforms in line with international standards, moves next to parliament.

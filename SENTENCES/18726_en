TBILISI, Georgia -- Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia sealed a framework accord Wednesday (February 7th) to build a railroad linking Kars, Akhalkalaki, Tbilisi, and Baku, as part of the efforts to revive the historic East-West trade route known as the Silk Road, and to boost regional co-operation. 
The $420m project envisions construction of the 105km railroad to begin within months, with completion by 2010. 
It is expected to allow the transportation of some 30m tonnes of goods per year. 
The officials --Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Georgian counterpart Mikhail Saakashavili -- also discussed energy issues during their meeting, agreeing on the need for alternative energy supply routes to Europe.

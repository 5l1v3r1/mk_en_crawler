TIRANA, Albania -- The labour inspectorate decided on Wednesday (January 16th) to shut down the Kurum Scrap Plant in Elbasan, central Albania, where an explosion Monday killed one worker and injured several others. 
Experts have determined that a defect in the furnace's cooling system caused the blast, not an unexploded shell accidentally thrown into a pile of scrap iron, as first reported. 
The inspectorate says the plant is a dangerous workplace.
In other news Wednesday, Prime Minister Sali Berisha ruled out any imminent cabinet shuffles. 
He described such requests -- coming from allies of his Democratic Party (DP) -- as normal, but said changes will occur within the DP, not in the government. 
Human Rights Union Party leader Vangjel Dule said his party will leave the coalition unless government reorganization occurs.

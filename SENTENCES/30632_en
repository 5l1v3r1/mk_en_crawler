SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The bank accounts of the A1 TV were frozen again on Monday (February 14th) following a court ruling in Skopje. 
The accounts of the popular TV channel, known for its criticism of the government, and nine other companies will remain temporarily blocked. 
The accounts were only unblocked last week. 
A1 TV owner Velija Ramkovski and the CEOs of other legal entities are under investigation for tax fraud and money laundering.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The upcoming referendum on Macedonia's new decentralisation laws reflects a broad disappointment with reforms rather than nationalist impulses, according to the UNDP's latest Early Warning Report for the country, released Tuesday (2 November).
According to Saso Ordanovski from the UNDP office in Skopje, Sunday's referendum indicates dissatisfaction with the policies of the current government and the process of economic and social transition.
Also Tuesday, the Dutch presidency of the EU issued a declaration stressing respect for the constitutional right to organise referenda on the new legislation, while warning that a delay in decentralisation would jeopardise the country's EU integration bid.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder delivered a similar message Tuesday, during a meeting in Berlin with Macedonian Prime Minister Hari Kostov.

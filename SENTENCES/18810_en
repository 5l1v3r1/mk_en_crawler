ANKARA, Turkey -- University rectors issued a special resolution on Thursday (April 5th), calling for the election of a consensus president next month.
According to the Higher Education Board's chairman, Erdogan Tezic, the rectors proposed four requirements for the future president:
to be independent, modern-minded, respectful of the state's secular character and have a model reputation.
In other news Thursday, prosecutors have decided not to indict Erdogan over a statement in which he allegedly used an honorific title when referring to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
The opposition had accused the prime minister of referring to Ocalan as "sayin", or esteemed, in an interview with an Australian radio station.
Prosecutors decided that there was "no element of criminal offence" in Erdogan's statement.

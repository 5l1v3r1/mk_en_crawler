SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prime Minister Nikola Spiric returned from Brussels on Tuesday (May 27th) and said he received assurances that signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and BiH will occur on June 16th.
Parliament adopted a police reform law crucial to signing the deal in early April.
However, a lengthy translation procedure caused a delay.
Also Tuesday, BiH presidency member Zeljko Komsic expressed scepticism that the main parties would reach an agreement on constitutional reform in the next two years.
At a round table on constitutional change, Komsic said that, while most of the public and most political parties understand the need for amendments, they are not ready to undertake them.

VIENNA, Austria -- The interior ministry confirmed on Thursday (November 11th) that its personnel went looking for war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic in Vienna on Saturday. 
One location was searched following an anonymous tip, ministry spokesperson Rudolf Gollia said. 
He added that Mladic was not located but that police found "subjective similarity" between the person living in the apartment and the fugitive. 
The embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Vienna told Tanjug that Austrian police raided the home of Avdo Saracevic, 62, on Saturday, looking for Mladic. 
Saracevic tells media in Sarajevo that he has hired a lawyer and plans to sue over the incident.

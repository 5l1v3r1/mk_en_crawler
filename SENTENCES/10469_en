ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and Albania are negotiating the transfer of about 2,000 Albanians serving prison sentences in Greece, a Greek Justice Ministry official said Wednesday (15 September). 
The two countries are also contemplating joint measures against organised crime, as well as co-operation between their judiciaries. 
Greece views the inmate transfer as a means of alleviating its overcrowded prisons, the official noted.

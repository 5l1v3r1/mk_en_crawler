SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian police say they have arrested two Muslims suspected of committing war crimes against Croats in southern BiH in September 1993.
Sarajevo police arrested Mustafa Hota and Enes Sakrak on Friday (22 August) night on suspicion that they had committed war crimes against civilians in the village of Grabovica, police spokeswoman Ljiljana Sakic told Reuters.
Sakic said the arrest was ordered by the Sarajevo cantonal court, and that UN prosecutors had agreed the two could be tried locally, as normally occurs with some low-profile war crimes cases.

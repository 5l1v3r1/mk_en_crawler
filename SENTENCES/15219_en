SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors reportedly have launched an investigation into the activities of a charity, the "Organisation for Islamic Tradition Revival Kuwait", suspected of financing terrorism.
Thursday's (29 June) edition of Nezavisne novine quotes a source that says the charity is linked to the Kuwait-based "Revival of Islamic Heritage Society", which is on the UN blacklist of organisations collaborating with al Qaeda.
In other news, members of the BiH State Investigation and Protection Agency -- with help from Republika Srpska police -- arrested six men early Wednesday.
They are suspected of organised crime activities and a series of car bomb explosions in Bileca and Trebinje.

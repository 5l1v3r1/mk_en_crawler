SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Leaders' meeting convened by President Gjorge Ivanov ended on Tuesday (March 22nd) without any agreement on holding early elections. 
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who heads the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, said that Branko Crvenkovki, leader of the main opposition SDSM, indicated no willingness to make concessions concerning their demands. 
Gruevski is threatening to hold early elections without the opposition. 
Crvenkovski says that is exactly what Gruevski wants to do, and he vowed that the opposition will continue its boycott of parliament and will not participate in any elections unless their demands are met.
Imer Selmani, leader of the opposition ethnic Albanian New Democracy, says the EU and the US should help mediate the political crisis. 
Parliament, meanwhile, voted to postpone a planned population census until October. 
It was supposed be held next month.

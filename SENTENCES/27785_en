ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader was sworn in as a member of parliament Friday (October 22nd), telling reporters afterwards that "unbelievable and undemocratic developments" had forced him to return to politics.
Sanader won the seat in the 2007 election as a candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), but put his mandate on hold after being appointed prime minister.
In July 2009, he unexpectedly stepped down.
He was expelled from his party when he first suggested that he might attempt a comeback in January, so he's serving now as an independent.

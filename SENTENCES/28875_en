PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Political parties agreed on Friday (October 8th) that early elections should be called in the wake of President Fatmir Sejdiu's resignation last month.
"All parties agreed that early elections are necessary due to the situation," Interim President Jakup Krasniqi said after consultations with members of all the political parties represented in parliament.
"Additional consultations will be held next week to determine the exact date."
Sejdiu resigned from the presidency in mid-September after the Constitutional Court ruled he violated the constitution by being president of the country and leader of the LDK at the same time.
The latest parliamentary elections in Kosovo were held in 2007, and under the constitution, the next ones were to be held in the end of 2011.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The trial of the 13 suspects charged with the March assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic will resume Monday (9 February) before a newly established special court in Belgrade. 
The court handles cases related to organised crime. 
The long-awaited trial began at the end of December but was rescheduled for undisclosed reasons. 
The alleged mastermind of the murder, former Special Operations Unit commander Milorad Lukovic Legija, remains at large along with six other suspects. 
All are members of the Zemun crime clan.

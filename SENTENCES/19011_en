PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament approved the new draft constitution on Monday (April 2nd) by a vote of 65 to 2. 
However, the measure includes several alternative amendments, regarding the regulation of state symbols, official languages and religious communities, as the ruling coalition and the opposition failed to agree on common definitions. 
The draft is now subject to 30 days of public debate, after which a parliamentary committee will hammer out a final version of the proposal. 
If it fails to attract a two thirds majority in parliament, a referendum will be held at a cost of up to 1.5m euros.

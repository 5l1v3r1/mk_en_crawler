PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic visited Podgorica on Monday (July 9th) where he sought support for the Kosovo issue and repeated Serbia's position against any form of independence for the province. 
Djelic stressed that Kosovo's independence would have an impact on the entire region, and might lead Southeast Europe into destabilisation. 
While in Podgorica, Djelic met with Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic and Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic, among others.
In other news, Serbia's Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said that Serbian parliamentary parties will begin consultations Tuesday on a new resolution on Kosovo. 
He said the new document will approve the steps taken thus far in the Kosovo discussions, determine the state's stance on new events, and give guidelines for national politics, including new discussions. 
The new resolution is expected to be approved by the end of the month.

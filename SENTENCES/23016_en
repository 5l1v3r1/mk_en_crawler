SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament adopted a new strategy Monday (November 3rd) aimed at resolving the name dispute between Skopje and Athens.
President Branko Crvenkovski told lawmakers that the strategy is necessary in light of Athens blocking Skopje's NATO accession bid.
"I am convinced and I claim that there is no serious alternative to the future of Macedonia besides its EU and NATO integration," Crvenkovski said.
He also announced that Nikola Dimitrov will no longer act as envoy in the name dispute, due to differences with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
Government spokesman Martin Protugjer will likely assume the post.
Separately Monday, Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Petros Doukas noted Greece's northern region of Macedonia "is larger in size and population than the country [Macedonia], and we cannot just discard that.
A geographically qualified name is something that is a good basis for both countries to work on," Doukas told Reuters during a visit to Belgrade.

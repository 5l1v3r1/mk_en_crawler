SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) reportedly is pressing further for the establishment of a commission to investigate cases of Serbs from Sarajevo still missing from the war. 
According to local media reports, nearly all deputies from RS parties left the session of the BiH House of Representatives (HoR) on Wednesday (24 May), blocking legislative work. 
RS lawmakers vowed to boycott the HoR until BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic orders the establishment of the commission. 
However, Terzic favours a panel that would investigate missing persons across the entire country, not just Sarajevo.
In other news Wednesday, police and members of the BiH State Information and Protection Agency reportedly arrested two Tunisians and one Algerian for suspected links to terrorism. 
Two were arrested in Zenica, the third in Zavidovici.

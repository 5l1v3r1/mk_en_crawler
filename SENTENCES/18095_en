SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative and EU Special Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling urged Parliament on Thursday (January 18th) to boost efforts aimed at adopting legislation necessary to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
Schwarz-Schilling met with the new leaders of the BiH House of Representatives, led by Speaker Beriz Belkic. 
He said lawmakers have an ambitious legislative agenda, since their predecessors failed to adopt even one piece of priority legislation outlined by the OHR last May.

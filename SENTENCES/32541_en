PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Filip Vujanovic is expected Monday (10 March) to announce the date presidential elections will be held. 
Local media in Podgorica report the vote would most likely take place in mid-May. 
A new election law eliminated the required 50 per cent voter turnout rule that invalidated two other elections in recent months. 
Last week, Vujanovic said the republic needs to elect a head of state to improve its image abroad.

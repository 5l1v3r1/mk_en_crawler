NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Britain's special envoy to Cyprus, Joan Ryan, said she is upbeat about the success of reunification talks between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot negotiators that will begin at a technical level Friday (April 18th). 
Ryan, who wrapped up a three-day visit to Cyprus on Thursday, said she believes the new talks could resolve the decades-long division of the island. 
"There will be difficulties, (but) I think a way forward is a real possibility now," she said.

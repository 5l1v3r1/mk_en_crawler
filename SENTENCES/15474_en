ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Commission's (EC) ambassador to Croatia, Vincent Degert, issued a statement Wednesday (26 July) condemning an ethnically motivated rock-throwing attack on houses of Serb returnees in the Zadar village of Biljani Donji the previous day.
Warning that such incidents violate "EU values of rule of law and tolerance", Degert noted that the Union would be closely monitoring the situation as part of Croatia's accession process.
President Stipe Mesic, Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, representatives of the OSCE and the local municipal administration visited the Serbian returnees on Wednesday.
They too denounced the incident and voiced confidence that those responsible will be punished.
Funds will be provided for repairs.

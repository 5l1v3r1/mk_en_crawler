BUCHAREST, Romania -- The opposition alliance Social-Liberal Union appealed the new labour code before the Constitutional Court on Thursday (March 17th), said Mircea Dusa, leader of the Social Democratic Party's group in parliament. 
The appeal challenges the constitutionality of adopting the code via an emergency procedure, which means a bill proposed by the cabinet is adopted without parliamentary debate or votes. 
The appeal also challenges specifics within the bill regarding employees' rights. 
The court is expected to discuss the motion next week.

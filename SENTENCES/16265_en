PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Prime Minister Agim Ceku called on the people of Kosovo to resist violence and learn to respect ethnic minorities.
In his radio weekly address Monday (15 May), he said now is the "time for peace, in which problems are solved through knowledge and work".
He also predicted Kosovo would gain independence within months.
Also Monday, the EU special envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Stefan Lehne, began a visit to Belgrade.
Discussions are expected to focus primarily on economic issues.
His stay in the Serbian capital follows a similar visit to Kosovo last week.

PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- A report commissioned by the OSCE strongly criticised the actions of the police and the judiciary in the human trafficking case involving a Moldovan girl forced into prostitution, according to Belgrade-based B92 on Thursday (20 November). 
The document concludes there was a failure to adhere to normal standards regarding human trafficking. 
Police and the prosecution were singled out as the two institutions that failed to handle properly the case.

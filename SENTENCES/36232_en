BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament voted Wednesday (3 March) to elect a new government headed by former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica.
His Democratic Party of Serbia will hold nine of the 17 portfolios, including the interior, justice and economy ministries.
Visiting Sarajevo, US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Pierre-Richard Prosper voiced Washington's concern over statements by Kostunica regarding Serbia's co-operation with the UN tribunal.
About $100m in US aid is riding on satisfactory co-operation with the war crimes court, a fact reiterated by Assistant US Secretary of State Elizabeth Jones, who testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

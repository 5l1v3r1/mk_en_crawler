BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Representatives of the European Commission and seven Southeast European (SEE) states -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro including Kosovo -- as well as Norway and Iceland agreed on Tuesday (20 December) on the creation of a European Common Aviation Area.
The deal, which is to be officially sealed in the first half of 2006, envisions that the single EU market for aviation would be extended to SEE by introducing common standards and regulations on safety, security, competition policy and consumer rights.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic and his visiting Croatian counterpart, Ivo Sanader, agreed on Friday (March 20th) to improve political and economic ties, and to leave behind disputes dating back to the 1991-1995 conflict.
Sanader pledged his country's support for Serbia's bid to join the EU saying Croatia will "not behave like Slovenia", referring to Slovenia's decision to block Zagreb's negotiation process with the EU.
Serbian-Croatian relations have been strained since the war over issues such as the return of Serbian refugees to Croatia and the fate of missing persons on both sides.
In 1999, Croatia filed a genocide suit against Serbia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over its role in the war.
Later, Serbia filed a countersuit.
On Saturday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reported progress in the ongoing talks between Croatia and Slovenia to solve their border dispute, according to media reports.
He said talks should continue toward a solution to enable Croatia's EU accession negotiations.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- National carrier Croatian Airlines had to cancel 33 of its 96 scheduled flights Friday (July 9th) due to a strike by union cabin crew personnel. 
The employees were protesting what they describe as poor management practices and failed negotiations on a new collective labour agreement. 
The airline estimated that 24,000 passengers were affected by the protest. 
The strike ended on Saturday after the union struck a deal with management over the collective labour agreement.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Authorities announced Friday (27 June) that former Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic would serve her prison term in Sweden. 
Plavsic pleaded guilty during her trial at The Hague and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. 
A justice ministry spokeswoman said Plavsic, 72, arrived in Stockholm on Thursday. 
She is likely to serve her term at a women's correctional facility known for its amenities. 
Bosnian activists have protested the decision, claiming that Swedish facilities are too comfortable for war criminals.
In other news, a former Bosnian Croat militia leader pleaded not guilty before the UN war crimes court on Friday. 
Ivica Rajic is charged with the deaths of at least 16 Muslims and the destruction of their village in 1993. 
He was arrested in Split in April after living in hiding since 1995.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The presidency of Serbia's ruling coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), praised a proposal Tuesday (16 September) to call presidential elections.
Serbian Parliament Speaker Natasa Micic, who also serves as acting Serbian President, had sent a letter to DOS seeking support, saying that she is legally obliged to call a vote.
Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said DOS would come up with a candidate within days.
Belgrade-based Radio B92 reports the front-runners are Defence Minister Boris Tadic and Federal Parliament Speaker Dragoljub Micunovic.
In other news, the trial of seven suspected members of Serbia's underworld opened in Belgrade on Tuesday.
They are charged with terrorism, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons in connection with the 2002 murder of Serbia's deputy police chief, General Bosko Buha.

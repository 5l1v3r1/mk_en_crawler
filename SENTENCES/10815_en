SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Preserving a stable and peaceful environment in BiH remains a key task for SFOR until the completion of its mandate, says the new SFOR commander, Brigadier General Steven P. 
Schook. 
He officially assumed command on Tuesday (5 October), succeeding Major General Virgil L. 
Packett II. 
Schook added that apprehending war crimes indictees remains a major SFOR responsibility.
Also Tuesday, Republika Srpska Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic announced that a special police unit, tasked with finding war crimes suspects, has been established in the entity. 
Matijasevic says efforts are under way to ensure full co-operation with The Hague tribunal. 
Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic visited The Hague on Tuesday to discuss ways to boost co-operation.
In other news Tuesday, police in Sarajevo announced that they would ban all nationalist symbols and photographs at a World Cup qualifier between the soccer teams of BiH and Serbia-Montenegro at the weekend. 
The police described the event as "high-risk," in light of clashes between fans after a friendly game two years ago.

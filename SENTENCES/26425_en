TIRANA, Albania -- Albania will export up to 3 billion kWh of energy to Italy every year, the Italian government has told the EU, according to local media reports Sunday (March 14th). 
Implementation is set to begin in five years as Italy looks for energy supplies outside its territory. 
The European Parliament decided last year that 20% of all energy consumed in the EU would be produced from renewable energy by 2020. 
Italy has already started to establish its energy projects in Albania, participating in construction of a wind park in Vlora, a biomass centre in Lezha and other hydro power plants.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana said on Monday (24 May) that the EU does not want to see Tomislav Nikolic become the president of Serbia in next month's election.
During a press conference following a meeting between the North Atlantic Council and the EU's Political and Security Committee, Solana said the Union would not support the Serbian Radical Party's nominee, and suggested Nikolic could have a negative effect on foreign investment in the country.
The deadline for submitting nominations expired Monday.
Eligibility will be determined by Friday.

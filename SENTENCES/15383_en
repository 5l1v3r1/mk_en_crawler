BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Senate and Chamber of Deputies on Thursday (27 July) rejected the resignations of the heads of the Romanian Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Agency, and the General Department of Internal Information and Protection.
The three officials -- Radu Timofte, Gheorghe Fulga and Virgil Ardelean, respectively -- stepped down a week ago following the disappearance of Omar Hayssam, implicated in the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq several months ago.
Reportedly, the resignations violated legal procedures.
Senate Speaker Nicolae Vacaroiu says the parliament will write a letter to President Traian Basescu, asking him to resubmit a request for the resignations and identifying the spy chiefs' successors.

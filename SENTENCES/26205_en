MADRID, Spain -- High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Valentin Inzko criticised the lack of major reforms in the country over the past three years at a meeting of EU political directors in Madrid on Thursday (January 14th).
Inzko stressed that the biggest concern is the continuing absence of political consensus.
He also acknowledged some positive steps, such as measures to meet requirements for scrapping EU visa requirements.
He added that continued progress on BiH's application to NATO would be a major stabilising factor.

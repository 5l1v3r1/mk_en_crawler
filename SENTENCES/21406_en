TIRANA, Albania -- The Albanian government and political elite tended to control independent state institutions last year, according to a Freedom House report published on Tuesday (June 24th). 
The document, called "Nations in Transit", says parties in power control the appointment of officials in these key institutions. 
The report by the non-profit organisation added that while Albania has a long way to go towards democracy and a market economy, the most serious challenges stem from efforts to reform the justice system and curb corruption.

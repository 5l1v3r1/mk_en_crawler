THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic asked The Hague war crimes tribunal on Friday (September 4th) to give him more time to prepare his defence. 
Karadzic says he and his advisers would need ten more months to review nearly one million pages of prosecution evidence. 
The request comes days after prosecutors scaled back the scope of their case, in response to a pre-trial judge's call to narrow it. 
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
His trial is expected to begin within weeks.

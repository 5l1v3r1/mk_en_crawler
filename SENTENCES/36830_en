ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE Mission to Croatia expressed concern Tuesday (13 July) over the prison sentence given journalist Ljubica Letinic for libel. 
The Split Regional Court earlier sentenced Letinic to a two-month suspended prison term. 
The OSCE statement also pointed to the case involving the editor-in-chief of the former Novi Brodski List daily, who refused to pay a fine for libel and now faces a jail term. 
The mission urged the government to move libel and defamation from the criminal code to the civil code, saying the threat of prison time would affect media freedom.
In other news Tuesday, the leaders of the Catholic and Muslim communities in Croatia met for the first time. 
Zagreb Archbishop Josip Bozanic and Mufti Sefko Efendi Omerbasic agreed on the need to develop relations and boost co-operation.

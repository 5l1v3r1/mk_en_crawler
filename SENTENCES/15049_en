BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, who is also chairman of the national council for co-operation with the UN tribunal, said on Thursday (1 December) that UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte would visit Belgrade on 8 December. 
She is to submit a new report on Serbia-Montenegro's co-operation with her tribunal to the UN Security Council on 15 December. 
Ljajic urged authorities to step up efforts to arrest war crimes fugitives, as no further surrenders are expected by then.

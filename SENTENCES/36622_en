ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government must fulfil its pledge to provide housing to all returning refugees, the head of the OSCE Mission to Croatia, Ambassador Peter Semneby, said at a press conference Friday (30 July).
Referring to a recent decision by the European Court of Human Rights, Semneby stressed it is essential that former occupancy/tenancy rights holders who wish to return are offered access to adequate housing.
He also said that the OSCE, along with the European Commission and the UNHCR, have begun drafting a "road map" for refugee returns for the governments of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro, which will propose concrete measures to close refugee return files in the next couple of years.

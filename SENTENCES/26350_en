BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday (January 12th) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is a "long way" from EU membership.
Speaking to journalists after talks with visiting BiH Presidency chairman Zeljko Komsic in Berlin, the German leader reiterated that chances for BiH's fast integration are slim, given a political stalemate that has blocked EU-related reforms.
Merkel also minimised hopes of visa-free travel.

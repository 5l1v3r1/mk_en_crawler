WASHINGTON, United States -- Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton Peace Accords, said in an article published Sunday (24 July) that the US government was right to intervene in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in 1995.
Examining developments since then, the former US diplomat said the ethnic communities have started to learn to live with each other in peace once again.
He noted that top Serbian and Bosnian Serb leaders attended the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, in what Holbrooke termed "an important effort at reconciliation".
At the same time, Holbrooke expressed regret that the most wanted war criminals -- Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic -- have not yet been apprehended.
He warned that BiH's return to the institutions of Europe will be hampered until the two are brought to justice.

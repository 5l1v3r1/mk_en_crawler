PODGORICA, Yugoslavia -- Former Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic was elected the republic's new parliamentary speaker Tuesday (5 November), during the legislature's constituent session. 
He was the sole choice for the post, nominated by the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), in which he holds the deputy leader position.
Vujanovic in turn could play a role in the party's decision to nominate President Milo Djukanovic as prime minister. 
The chairman of the Montenegrin Constitutional Court, Radoje Korac said Tuesday that as the president is entitled to nominate the prime minister-designate, Djukanovic could resign from his post and hand off provisional duties to the parliamentary speaker until the 22 December presidential elections.

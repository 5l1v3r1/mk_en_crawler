BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders wrapped up a two-day summit Friday (June 20th) saying, "Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) must continue the implementation of the reform process without delay, particularly with a view to fulfilling the objectives and conditions for the transition from the Office of the High Representative to the [EU] Special Representative." The European Council also welcomed the recent signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, describing it as "an important step in that country's European course".
On a related note, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told the Slovenian newspaper Delo that the prospect of EU membership is one of the rare objectives that unite Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats in BiH, despite the expectation the country will be unable to join the Union any time soon. 
But Dodik also said that it is unacceptable to set conditions on BiH's EU integration process that necessitate reforms to internal relations defined by the Dayton Peace Accord. 
Dodik made a daylong visit to Slovenia on Sunday, where he and Prime Minister Janez Jansa discussed the political and economic situation in the region.

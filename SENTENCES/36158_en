BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An estimated 150 Bosnian Serb police officers took part in a search for Radovan Karadzic, the UN tribunal's top war crimes suspect, which started Friday (12 March) night. 
Police spokesman Dragomir Peric said the operation ended late Saturday without arrests. 
It was the first such operation by Bosnian Serb police on their own, with SFOR troops monitoring the action. 
According to the spokesman, the authorities received credible information that Karadzic was in the area of Bratunac, near the border with Serbia.
In other news, SFOR used the 61st birthday of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to post full-page ads for his arrest in several newspapers in Republika Srpska. 
The ads included the message "Ratko, we have not forgotten" and a picture of handcuffs wrapped as a gift.

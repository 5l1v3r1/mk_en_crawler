ATHENS, Greece -- The government has rejected calls from the opposition to put the new European Constitution to a popular vote. 
A spokesman for the cabinet told reporters on Friday (29 October) that parliament would ratify the new European main law. 
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was quoted as saying that Greece, particularly its islands and tourist industry, would benefit from the constitution. 
Socialist leader George Papandreou had called for the referendum.

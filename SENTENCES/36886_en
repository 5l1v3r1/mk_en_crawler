SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Suspended Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski was restored to his post by the Sofia City Court on Wednesday (7 July). 
The court agreed with Sofianski's argument that the investigation term has already expired and most of the witnesses have been heard. 
The mayor was suspended amid charges of mismanagement and damage to municipal interests stemming from the 1998 sale of a downtown shopping mall. 
The case was widely perceived to be political in nature.

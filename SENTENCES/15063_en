ANKARA, Turkey -- A new EU-sponsored project to establish intermediate courts of appeal in Turkey was formally inaugurated on Tuesday (31 January) in Ankara.
The new courts would function between first-instance courts and the last-instance Court of Cassation, helping to ensure the right to a fair trial.
In other news, jailed Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan has asked for a retrial, following a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that his original trial was flawed.
Under current law, however, Turkey does not allow retrials.
On Wednesday, meanwhile, the Statistics Board reported that Turkey's foreign trade deficit widened by 24.9 per cent to $42.9 billion in 2005.
Though exports rose, imports were even higher.

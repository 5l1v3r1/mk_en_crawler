BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Friday (January 15th) that Macedonia should continue with reforms aimed at NATO entry, expressing confidence that these efforts will end in success.
At a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski at NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Rasmussen said Skopje's accession to NATO also depends on the settlement of its name dispute with Greece.
He added that the faster this issue is resolved, the faster Macedonia will become part of the Alliance.
Rasmussen called for intensified talks on the issue and welcomed efforts by UN envoy Matthew Nimetz to broker an agreement.
In response, Gruevski said his country is "trying to find a solution which would be acceptable to both sides".

WASHINGTON, United States -- Successful negotiations on Kosovo's future status will boost Serbia's changes for membership in the EU and NATO, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns noted during a press briefing Thursday (10 November). 
On the other hand, he said, failed negotiations or an outbreak of violence would affect the bids of every country in the region. 
Burns also said Serbia's Euro-Atlantic integration process would be halted as long as war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic remains a fugitive.
In Pristina Thursday, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said status talks should start this month. 
To prepare for negotiations, German diplomat Michael Schaefer, chairman of the six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo, is visiting Belgrade on Friday.

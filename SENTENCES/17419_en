SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A forum addressing the rights of ethnic minorities in Macedonia was held in Skopje on Monday (February 26th), with participants agreeing on the need to step up efforts by the executive power, at both the central and local levels, to promote policies of broader minority rights. 
A survey presented by the Common Values NGO concludes that communication among the different ethnic groups in Macedonia remains mostly formal, and that purely friendly relations are being replaced by business partnerships.

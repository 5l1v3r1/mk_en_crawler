BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Boris Tadic was elected chairman of the Democratic Party (DS) on Sunday (22 February). 
He posted a convincing victory: 1,538 of the delegates at the party's general assembly voted for Tadic, compared to 296 for outgoing Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic. 
Nenad Bogdanovic, Dusan Petrovic, Bojan Pajtic and Slobodan Gavrilovic -- all close to Tadic -- were elected deputy party leaders. 
Though Tadic has generally favoured joining a democratic government, the other parties eventually excluded DS from the talks due to failure to reach an agreement.
In other news, Serbian Prime Minister-designate Vojislav Kostunica said Saturday that war crimes co-operation would not be a priority of the new government. 
"This country isn't a delivery service for human merchandise to The Hague tribunal," said Kostunica, raising fears over the likely negative impacts of any future non-co-operation. 
In contrast, Croatian Justice Minister Vesna Skare Ozbolt said on Sunday (22 February) that their government should cultivate good co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
She stressed that contacts with The Hague would help in writing a true historic account of events in the region.(HINA, HRT, Vjesnik, Beta, BBC, B92 - 22/02/04)

TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission considers unacceptable Albania's rejection of Audrey Glover as the new head of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), local media reported on Wednesday (May 13th). 
The ruling coalition objects to her appointment this time around because her first posting in Albania produced a report in 1996 that the same right-wing coalition branded "unrealistic". 
"The government's position does not match the criteria of a country which aims to become part of the EU," said Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. 
Albania holds general elections on June 28th.

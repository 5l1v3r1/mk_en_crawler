BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The editor of the Bosnian Serb weekly Patriot and his family were placed under police protection Tuesday (1 June) after receiving death threats. 
Slobodan Vaskovic said a man called on Saturday to warn him that he would be blown up if he does not move his newspaper out of Republika Srpska. 
Last week, the editor of a Montenegrin newspaper was shot to death.
In other news, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte visited Bogojno on Tuesday as part of a five-day trip to BiH. 
She was greeted by several hundred protesters who demanded that the killers of dozens of people during the 1992-1995 conflict be brought to justice.

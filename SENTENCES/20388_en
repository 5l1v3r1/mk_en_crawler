BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic has formally dissolved parliament and scheduled early elections for May 11th. 
His decision Thursday (March 13th) came at the request of the cabinet, as required by the constitution. 
Parliamentary elections will thus be held the same day as local elections and those for the assembly of the autonomous province of Vojvodina. 
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica resigned last week, after acknowledging the ruling coalition could not overcome differences on Kosovo and EU integration.
Kostunica's Serbian Democratic Party was suspended from the European People's Party in Brussels on Thursday. 
French MEP Alain Lamassoure described the move as an effort to encourage Kostunica to "take more European positions" and to soften his opposition to Kosovo's independence.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael Polt said Thursday (20 January) that Washington's decision to suspend aid to Serbia is not a sanction. 
"We wanted to send a message that we're not happy about the lack of co-operation with The Hague tribunal," said Polt, insisting the decision was simply a warning.
In other news, EU security chief Javier Solana has cancelled a planned visit to Belgrade. 
His spokeswoman explained that local authorities have not shown progress on issues that were supposed to be the focus of the talks.

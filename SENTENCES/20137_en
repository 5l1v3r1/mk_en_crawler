TIRANA, Albania -- Another miner, Sami Doga, 45, died on Sunday (December 16th) after he was trapped 1,000m underground a week ago in the Bulqiza Mine in central Albania. 
The accident happened after a gallery roof collapsed, taking the life of Doga and injuring three other miners. 
Doga, a father of three, is the sixth miner to die in the mine in the past year.

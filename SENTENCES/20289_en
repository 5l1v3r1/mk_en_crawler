BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Parliament (EP) President Hans-Gert Poettering said on Tuesday (October 16th) that to avoid the safeguard clauses stipulated in its EU accession agreement, Romania must reform its agricultural sector. 
Meeting in Bucharest with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, Poettering also warned that the EU expects Romania to show more progress in its anti-corruption efforts regarding the sector. 
Last week, Brussels threatened to cut agricultural development aid cut by 25% unless Romania's EU fund distribution system is strengthened. 
Tariceanu, for his part, assured Poettering that the government is working to eliminate all weaknesses in the system.
In other news, the Council for Study of the Securitate Archives announced on Tuesday that there is not enough evidence to prove that the new leader of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Daniel, collaborated with the communist-era secret police. 
Daniel, who became archbishop of Romania in September, was suspected of having collaborated with the Securitate while he studied in Strasbourg in the 1980s.

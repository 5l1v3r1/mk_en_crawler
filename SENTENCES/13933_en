BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's interior ministry on Wednesday (17 August) confirmed the arrest in Belgrade of a suspect wanted on an international warrant for the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid. 
Moroccan-born Abdelmajid Bouchar, 22, fled from a Madrid suburban apartment three weeks after the blasts, as police closed in. 
An international warrant was issued for Bouchar but the trail ran cold until his recent arrest in Belgrade for violating Serbian immigration regulations, according to an interior ministry statement. 
Bouchar was carrying forged Iraqi documents using the name Midhat Salah and refused to co-operate with Serbian authorities. 
They sent his fingerprints to the international police agency, Interpol. 
Spanish police were subsequently able to determine his real identity.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The opposition right-wing parties Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) officially signed a pre-election agreement Friday (March 13th), after backing it earlier in the week. 
The two parties will co-operate in both the elections for the European Parliament and Bulgaria's parliament this summer and have indicated other parties could join their coalition.
In other news, about 10,000 police officers staged a peaceful protest in Sofia on Sunday, demanding better working conditions and a 50% pay rise. 
Around 2,000 protesters headed to the Czech Embassy, to submit a letter with their demands, as the country holds the rotating EU presidency. 
Bulgaria's interior ministry describes the 50% pay hike as "absurd".

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Bishop Irinej of Nis, elected Friday (January 22nd) as the new patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, was enthroned Saturday.
"It is a big day for me and I believe a big day for our people and our church ...
our first duty as a Church is to safeguard our Kosovo, a holy and martyred land, to help our state to defend it from those who wish to seize [it]," the 80-year-old Irinej said.

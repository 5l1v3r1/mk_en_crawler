BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Council of Europe may address this month or next a technical request to the European Commission (EC) to determine the extent to which Montenegro deserves to receive EU candidate status, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday (March 9th). 
After meeting with Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic in Brussels, Rehn added the EC would offer an opinion once the Council of Europe addresses this request. 
Rehn explained that he had encouraged Montenegro to strengthen its capacity for state administration and the rule of law, as well as its fight against organised crime and corruption. 
Meanwhile, Djukanovic, who was in Brussels to address members of the North Atlantic Council, said the Western Balkans had a clear Euro-Atlantic perspective and great political and economic potential.

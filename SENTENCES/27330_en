ZAGREB, Croatia -- The cabinet approved an arbitration agreement with Slovenia on Friday (October 30th) that should result in solution to the year-long border dispute between the two states. 
The agreement was forwarded to parliament for approval, accompanied by a unilateral statement saying the agreement does not pre-judge the outcome of international arbitration. 
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor expects parliamentary approval early this week, followed by a signing ceremony with Slovenia mid-week.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Thousands gathered in Pristina on Wednesday (November 19th) to oppose a continued UNMIK role in Serb-dominated areas of Kosovo. 
The Self-Determination movement and 30 other NGOs organised the rally in an effort to persuade leaders to continue resisting the demands of the UN and the EU, which want to co-ordinate deployment of the EU-led EULEX mission with Serbia. 
Specifically, the UN's mission, UNMIK, would retain control of police stations and customs offices in the northern part of Kosovo and in other Serb-dominated areas south of the Ibar. 
Kosovo insists that as an independent country, it must have full control of its territory. 
The demonstrators waved flags and chanted anti-UNMIK slogans during the peaceful rally. 
A day earlier, the government firmly rejected the six-point plan for EULEX's deployment proposed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

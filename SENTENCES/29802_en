BRUSSELS, Belgium-- The second round of Pristina-Belgrade dialogue was held in Brussels on Monday (March 28th) focusing on civil registry and cadastral data. 
In a statement afterwards, the EU said that the sides decided to establish a working group headed by EULEX to handle practical matters involved in putting together data in the civil registry. 
Media reported that EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton attended the meeting briefly, encouraging both parties to find practical solutions to all issues. 
The head of Pristina's team, Edita Tahiri, said that her side is insisting on receiving the original cadastral documentation but may accept a copy of the civil registry. 
Prior to the meeting, Tahiri raised the issue of Serbia's telecommunication and energy system interfering in Kosovo, thus harming the quality of service. 
The head of the Belgrade team, Borislav Stefanovic, said that there has been progress about cadastral books and registers, as well as concerning energy supply. 
The next meeting is expected in mid-April.

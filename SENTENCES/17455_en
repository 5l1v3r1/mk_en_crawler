ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Monday (May 21st) urged Macedonia to "abandon intransigence" in its name dispute with Greece, noting that as both an EU and NATO member, Greece could stymie Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic accession bids if the issue is not settled. 
Karamanlis added that Greece has already offered some compromises in UN-sponsored name negotiations and that Macedonia should do the same.
In other news, in an interview Monday with Frankfurt's Allgemeine Zeitung, Serbian President Boris Tadic criticised Macedonia's recent claim that it would be the first country to recognise Kosovo's independence. 
He described the attitude as wrong and dangerous.

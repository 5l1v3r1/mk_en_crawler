SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country's politicians agreed on Friday (November 30th) to resolve a dispute over parliamentary voting procedures which had brought BiH to the brink of a major political crisis. 
Miroslav Lajcak, the international community's top envoy, proposed the new rules to prevent politicians from blocking the adoption of legislation by staging walkouts. 
He also introduced similar rules for the central government. 
At a meeting in Lajcak's office, Bosnian Serb leaders dropped their objections to the proposed amendments, clearing the way for parliament to adopt them shortly after that.
"This is a strong, positive message to Europe from Sarajevo," Lajcak said in a televised address. 
He also announced that EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn would travel to Sarajevo to discuss the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the first step on the road to membership in the EU. 
Dimitris Kourkoulas, head of the European Commission delegation in BiH, said Rehn will arrive on Monday.

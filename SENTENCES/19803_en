SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian met with the leader of the Islamic community in BiH, Reis-l-ulema Mustafa efendija Ceric, on Tuesday (August 21st) in Sarajevo.
They discussed the need to underscore that Bosnian Muslims abhor terrorism in all of its forms.BiH is an important partner in the global fight against terrorism and is facing the same challenges as the United States, Europe and other parts of the world in resolving these problems, Gregorian said.
He also clarified recent comments in which he appeared to suggest that BiH offered shelter to terrorists.
He assured Ceric that his statement referred to only a small number of former foreign fighters.
"BiH security and law enforcement agencies are capable of dealing with these people, there is no need to fear them," Gregorian said.
Ceric, for his part, reiterated the Islamic Community's commitment to countering ideologies that promote intolerance and hate.

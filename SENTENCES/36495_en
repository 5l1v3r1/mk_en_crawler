BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten told Serbia-Montenegro Deputy Foreign Minister Predrag Boskovic that his country needs to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal if it wants to move closer to membership in the EU. 
"We are serious and we would like to see you join even closer to the European family but whether that happens is in your hands and the hands of your political leaders," Patten said at a press briefing in Belgrade on Tuesday (11 May). 
Boskovic acknowledged that he has been warned about compliance with the tribunal's requests and promised to work to that end.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Friday (23 December) that the government will provide legal assistance to retired General Ante Gotovina in his defence at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Speaking on national radio, Sanader announced that the cabinet would also assist other army generals facing war crimes charges from the 1991-1995 conflict.
In a separate statement for Croatian national TV Friday, Sanader said the launch of EU accession talks and settling the state's debt to pensioners were his government's biggest successes in the past two years.

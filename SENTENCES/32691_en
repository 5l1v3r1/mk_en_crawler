SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian government decided on Thursday (19 December) to move ahead with shutting down the two oldest reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant under a 1999 agreement with the EU.
The decommissioning of the two 440-megawatt units will start immediately.
The government has also agreed to shut down two more reactors in 2006 if a technical inspection by the EU finds them unsafe to operate.
Also on Thursday, the Bulgarian Cabinet of Ministers decided to re-open the project for construction of a second nuclear plant in Belene.
The proposal was made by Energy Minister Milko Kovachev and was approved at a regular ministerial meeting.
The Belene project was frozen in 1991 and was first brought back to life by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg eight months ago.
Four feasibility studies will be conducted in the next six months and then a final decision whether to re-open the project will be made.(bTV, BNT, BTA, AP, AFP - 19/12/02)

PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- On Wednesday (May 21st), the Czech Republic became the 41st country to formally recognise Kosovo's independence, declared unilaterally on February 17th. 
Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said his country plans to establish diplomatic ties with Kosovo soon.
In other news Wednesday, representatives of the UN, EU, NATO and UNMIK met in Vienna but failed to reach any decision on the relationship between UNMIK, EULEX and the International Civilian Office after June 15th, when Kosovo's new constitution will enter into force. 
"The question remains what exactly will happen with the rule of law sector, how this sector will be related to EULEX. 
However, people are working on this issue," UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker said, after returning from Vienna.

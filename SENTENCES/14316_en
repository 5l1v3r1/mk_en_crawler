VLORA, Albania -- Police reported on Saturday (10 December) that they confiscated some 400kg of cannabis discovered in an abandoned speedboat near the Vlora coast.
Officials say the vessel was detected Friday evening near the bay of Gjuheza but managed to escape after a nearly three-hour chase.
Traffickers are believed to have been transporting the drugs either to Greece or Italy.

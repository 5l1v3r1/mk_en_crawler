ROME, Italy -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed on Thursday (November 8th) to continue with political reforms requested by the EU.
Speaking at a Turkish-Italian business forum in Rome, Erdogan said Turkey will continue on the road to the EU, but would demand clear membership rules.
"The rules of the game were made in advance and the goalposts cannot then be moved," Erdogan stressed.
He said reforms must continue because membership would ultimately be in the interest of Turkey and the broader region.
A European Commission progress report released on Tuesday criticised the government for failing to implement any substantial reforms in the past two years.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Addressing huge crowds in Bucharest on Saturday (23 November), US President George W Bush delivered a clear message: terrorism will be opposed by free nations and defeated. 
Linking the late Romanian ruler Nicolae Ceausescu to Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Bush praised the courage of Romanians who fought for freedom and rose up to overthrow dictatorship. 
As he spoke, a rainbow appeared over Revolution Square. 
"Your country ... 
brings moral clarity to our NATO alliance," Bush told the rain-soaked crowd, referring to the invitation to join NATO extended to Romania last week. 
"You value freedom because you have lived without it. 
You know the difference between good and evil because you have seen evil's face." (AP - 24/11/02; AP, Rompres, Reuters, AFP - 23/11/02)

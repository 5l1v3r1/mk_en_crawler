BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chairman of the BiH Parliament's House of Representatives (HoR), Nikola Spiric, said Sunday (7 March) that the Office of the High Representative would reject the nomination of Dragomir Dumic to the new post of state defence minister. 
According to Spiric, Dumic's nomination by the Serb Democratic Party lacked support from the international community. 
He also accused Republika Srpska (RS) authorities of not co-operating effectively with the UN war crimes tribunal, saying that the RS Parliament did not understand the entity could soon be sanctioned for failing to bring indicted war criminals to justice.
In other news, parliament's House of Peoples on Friday passed the law on establishing the BiH Intelligence Security Agency, which would collect, analyse and distribute intelligence information. 
The version must still be reconciled with one already passed by the HoR.

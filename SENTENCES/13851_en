SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In an interview in Friday's (19 August) Monitor newspaper, former Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said the new ruling coalition is the right choice for Bulgaria as it would guarantee the country's further development. 
He noted the positive response the cabinet has received from Bulgaria's EU partners, and said the coalition, composed of the top three finishers in the 25 June elections, fully reflects the will of the people.
In other news, the interior ministry announced on Thursday that police raided four illegal workshops making guns for Bulgarian gangsters in Italy and Spain. 
Four gunsmiths, who were employees or former employees of the small-arms manufacturer Arsenal, were arrested in Wednesday's raids in the central Kazanlak region.

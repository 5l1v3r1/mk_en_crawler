THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial against former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic resumed on Monday (August 6th) at the UN war crimes tribunal. 
In his opening statement, defence attorney Eugene O'Sullivan said Milutinovic is not guilty and had always insisted the Kosovo problem be resolved peacefully and with negotiations. 
The ex-president, O'Sullivan said, had advocated giving Kosovo autonomy and ensuring the peaceful co-existence of all ethnic communities there.
On Tuesday, the first witness for the defence -- constitutional law professor Ratko Markovic -- takes the stand. 
The defence plans to summon only two others. 
Milutinovic, along with former Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic and Generals Dragoljub Ojdanic, Nebojsa Pavkovic, Vladimir Lazarevic and Sreten Lukic, is charged with the deportation, murder and persecution of about 800,000 Kosovo Albanians in the first half of 1999.

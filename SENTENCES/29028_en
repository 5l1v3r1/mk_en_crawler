ZAGREB, Croatia -- On the eve of Croatia's Independence Day, President Ivo Josipovic said on Thursday (October 7th) that he is aware the country faces many challenges, but at the same time should be optimistic.
"The difference between today and October 8th 1991 is huge.
From a country that fought for its survival, Croatia has now turned into a country that is at the gates of the EU and that will certainly soon become a full-fledged EU member," Josipovic told reporters after a parliament session marking Independence Day.

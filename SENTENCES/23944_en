BELGRADE, Serbia -- The two ministers who represent ethnic minorities in the cabinet -- Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Minister without Portfolio Sulejman Ugljanin of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) -- are at odds over an incident between their parties' supporters in the predominantly Muslim Novi Pazar area. 
During the weekend clash, gunshots erupted, injuring one person. 
The SDP says the police in Novi Pazar, who are close to the SDA, waited too long before intervening. 
On Monday, the SDP said it plans to request the dismissal of the heads of the Novi Pazar police station and to demand an investigation into a statement issued by the government press office in support of Ugljanin. 
The SDP said it would ask President Boris Tadic to choose one of the parties to remain in his cabinet.

TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) adopted new lists for regional commission members, updating the names of opposition representatives Tuesday (March 29th). 
The Socialist Party and the Human Rights Party missed two deadlines for submitting their lists, forcing independent volunteers from the civil society to fill empty seats in the commissions. 
Those volunteers have now resigned.
The parties participating in the May 8th local elections met for the first time Tuesday to discuss preparations for the process, but failed to reach a consensus on many issues. 
The ruling Democratic Party suggested an agreement that sets rules and conditions on the behaviour of the parties in line with OSCE recommendations. 
The opposition Socialist Party insisted that transparency before and after the elections should be guaranteed, including through amendments to the Electoral Code.
Also Tuesday, the OSCE's office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights officially opened its monitoring mission. 
A total of 400 short-term observers will be employed on Election Day.

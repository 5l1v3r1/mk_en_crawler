BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Superior Council of Magistracy (CSM) rejected the nomination of Monica Serbanescu as head of the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), media reported on Monday (September 8th). 
In August, Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu nominated criminal prosecutor Serbanescu for the post after replacing then-DNA chief prosecutor Daniel Morar over suspected corruption and other alleged offences. 
General Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi said Serbanescu's performance has not convinced her that she is the right person to head the DNA. 
Kovesi announced she has extended Morar's mandate for 90 days until a new DNA chief prosecutor is named. 
Predoiu described the CSM's decision as a "regrettable error".

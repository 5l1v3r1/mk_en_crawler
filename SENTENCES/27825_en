TIRANA, Albania -- The interior ministry has established a special fund to inform the public about the EU visa liberalisation process. 
About 350,000 euros will be spent to prepare TV spots and run them on national stations, the ministry announced on Thursday (May 20th). 
The government wants to make sure people are aware of both the benefits and restrictions involved with visa-free travel. 
The catalyst was citizens from Macedonia and Serbia seeking asylum in EU countries after receiving visa-free travel in December.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the tribunal in The Hague want to merge the cases of indicted Croatian generals Ivan Cermak, Mladen Markac and Ante Gotovina, according to a statement released Thursday (24 March).
The first two cases are already being considered together.
The three generals face charges of war crimes stemming from the so-called Storm operation in 1995.
Lawyers representing Cermak and Markac say they oppose the merger, while the advocate for Gotovina spoke in favour of it.
Gotovina remains on the run.
The other two generals surrendered and have been released on bail.

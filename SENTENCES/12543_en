THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is due to resume on Tuesday (11 January) after a three-week Christmas recess.
The defendant has been on trial since February 2002, facing more than 60 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide.
He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
Two French peacekeepers are due to appear as defence witnesses early in the week.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The National Security Council voiced concern Wednesday (October 31st) over tensions in some areas of the country, following the recent killing of a policeman near the border with Kosovo and the resignation of the Constitutional Court's ethnic Albanian president over a dispute on the use of the Albanian flag. 
President Branko Crvenkovski told reporters that the incidents had occurred in areas in the centre of the 2001 ethnic conflict, and warned they might be exploited for political purposes.

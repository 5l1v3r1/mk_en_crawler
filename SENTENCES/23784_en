SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) --Bosnian Serb television RTRS aired on Wednesday (July 22nd) footage allegedly proving crimes committed by Bosnian Muslim forces against Serb prisoners of war in 1994.
The video shows General Atif Dudakovic ordering his troops to shoot two captured soldiers dead.
Three years ago, Republika Srpska filed charges against Dudakovic for war crimes, but prosecutors have not yet indicated whether they have conducted an investigation.

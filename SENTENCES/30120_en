VIENNA, Austria -- The Public Prosecutor's Office against corruption is investigating former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and two others for suspected money laundering, media reported on Tuesday (December 21st). 
"We have launched criminal proceedings against Sanader, against one of his relatives, and against a third person," Friedrich Koenig, spokesperson for the Vienna-based prosecutor's office, told Croatia's RTL TV. 
The probe began following a report from a bank in Tyrol, suggesting possible money laundering. 
Sanader was arrested on December 10th in Salzburg, based on an arrest warrant issued by Croatia. 
He is reportedly under investigation there for possible criminal actions and abuse of office.

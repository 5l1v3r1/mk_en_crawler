SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Brigadier General Steven P. 
Schook hands over command of the NATO HQ in BiH to US Brigadier General Louis W. 
Weber next week. 
The transfer will be marked by a formal ceremony at Camp Butmir on Wednesday (31 August).
In other news, the head of the EU Police Mission (EUPM) in BiH, Kevin Carty, believes the EUPM mandate must continue in some form beyond December, when it is set to expire. 
In an interview in Friday's Dnevni avaz, Carty said the current mission likely could be extended, but noted a request must come from the BiH Council of Ministers.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The foreign ministers of several Muslim states adopted a joint declaration Thursday (23 January), urging Iraq to co-operate more actively with the UN. 
The statement was issued by the foreign ministers of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, who met in Istanbul. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis said Baghdad must provide weapons inspectors with more information about its military facilities and their capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction.
Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested the current regime in Iraq is detrimental to Turkey, adding it would be in the best interest of the Turkish people if Saddam Hussein were removed from power.

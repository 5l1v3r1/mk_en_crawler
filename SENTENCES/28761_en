PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo Albanians and Serbs clashed in the divided town of Mitrovica late on Saturday (September 11th) after Serbia's basketball team lost to Turkey in a semifinal match of the 2010 World Basketball Championship in Istanbul.
The brawl happened at the bridge over the Ibar River, which separates the town into a Serb-dominated north and Albanian-dominated south.
Five people were injured, one needing hospitalisation.
Police and KFOR presence at the scene has been boosted.

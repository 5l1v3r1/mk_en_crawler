SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's multiethnic government survived a vote of no-confidence Saturday (18 September).
Three-quarters of the MPs present rejected the motion, which the opposition submitted earlier this week, accusing Prime Minister Hari Kostov's governments of failures in domestic and foreign policy, delays in Euro-Atlantic integration and deterioration of the economic situation in the country.
Meanwhile, a poll conducted by Transparency Macedonia suggests a lack of transparency in the work of Macedonian government institutions, as well as limited citizen access to information.
The organisation presented the results of the survey at a news conference Friday (17 September).
Seventy-nine per cent of the 1,200 respondents said they were not provided with the needed information upon request, and 41 per cent did not know that free access to information was constitutionally guaranteed in Macedonia.

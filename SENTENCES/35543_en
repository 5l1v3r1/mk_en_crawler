ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE mission in Croatia said Sunday (8 February) the country's law on state radio and television is broadly consistent with EU standards, but does not completely exclude possible political intervention in the national media institutions. 
Alessandro Fracassetti, a spokesman for the OSCE mission to Croatia, said the long parliamentary process involved in appointing the executive council of the national radio and television has raised concerns about political motives.

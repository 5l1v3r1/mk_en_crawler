ANKARA, Turkey -- Three children were killed when a bomb exploded in front of a garage in Beldeler, eastern Turkey, on Saturday (13 May). 
The victims were three boys aged 6, 11 and 12. 
Two of the children were brothers. 
One other child was injured. 
According to the local governor, the explosive device was a time bomb. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the incident; however, the banned Turkish Communist Party-Marxist Leninist has used similar explosive devices in the past.
Separately, media reports Saturday said a total of five people -- four Turkish army soldiers and one Kurdish militant -- died in new clashes between the Turkish military and the Kurdistan Workers' Party in the country's southeast. 
In another incident, a Turkish soldier died during patrolling near the border with Iraq the previous day, after stepping on a landmine.

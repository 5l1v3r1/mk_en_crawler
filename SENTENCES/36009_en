WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W Bush on Monday (29 March) welcomed the seven new members of NATO at a special White House ceremony.
"As witness to some of the great crimes of the last century, our new members bring moral clarity to the purposes of our Alliance," he told the prime ministers of Bulgaria, Romania and five other nations.
"The door to NATO will remain open until the whole of Europe is united in freedom and in peace," the president said, referring to three other countries that hope to join -- Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia.
The prime ministers of these three nations also attended the ceremony.
The new members will take their seats Friday at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels.
Analysts say the expansion, the largest in NATO history, has strategic and economic implications for all parties.

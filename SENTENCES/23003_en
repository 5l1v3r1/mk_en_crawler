LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The foreign ministry on Monday (November 3rd) rejected accusations it is blocking Croatia's EU accession talks.
The argument arose last week after Ljubljana refused to back the opening of three new chapters in EU accession talks with Croatia.
Current EU presidency holder France hoped to open at least four of the 35 policy chapters at a meeting with Croatian officials last Thursday, but Slovenia vetoed the effort.
As a result, the meeting was able only to close an already-negotiated chapter on external relations.
Slovenia insisted that the outgoing Slovenian government is managing solely day-to-day affairs until the formation of a new cabinet.
But Croatia's chief negotiator with the EU, Vladimir Drobnjak, thought otherwise and urged the exclusion of bilateral issues, such as simmering territorial disputes, from negotiations.

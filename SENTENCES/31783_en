SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Human Rights Chamber has ruled that authorities breached the human rights of two Algerian terrorist suspects, arrested in 2001 with other Algerians suspected of planning attacks against the US and British embassies in Sarajevo.
Mustafa Aid Idir and Belkasem Bensayah were later deported to the United States, which according to the human right tribunal, was in breach of the European Human Rights Convention regulations on expulsion, illegal detention and abolition of the death penalty.
The panel called on BiH authorities to prevent the United States from sentencing the two to death.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- As expected, the Kosovo Parliament backed UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's draft proposal to resolve the province's status on Wednesday (March 14th). 
Prior to the vote, President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Agim Ceku and others issued statements saying they expect the document to lead to Kosovo's independence.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH presidency Chairman Dragan Covic called on public institutions and the opposition to join forces Wednesday (19 November) in support of EU conditions for signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement next year.
Covic said he believes the county will fulfill the 16 benchmarks drafted by the Feasibility Study of the European Commission for BiH over the next eight months.
The document released by the Commission on Tuesday praised the country for achieving "significant progress" but conditioned the signing of the Agreement on continued reforms.

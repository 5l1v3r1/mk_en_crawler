ATHENS, Greece -- Representatives of Christian churches from around the world gathered in Athens on Monday (9 May) to discuss challenges to the faith, such as the growing rifts between churches and the problem of African congregations affected by AIDS.
About 500 supporters of the hardline Greek Orthodox Movement staged a rally protesting the event, which they described as a "heretic" gathering.

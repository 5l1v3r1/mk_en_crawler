ATHENS, Greece -- Owners of trucks and containers used for national transport, who are on strike demanding that the state pay them higher transportation fees, will decide on Tuesday (May 13th) whether to continue their protest. 
Nearly all filling stations in Greece now lack fuel. 
Both Monday and Tuesday, representatives met with Deputy Minister of Economy and Finance Andonis Bezas. 
The protesters also talked with Employment Minister Fani Palli-Petralia, who suggested forming a working group to consider the issues. 
On Friday, Transport Minister Costis Hatzidakis rejected a demand for a 13% rise in payments but agreed to lift restrictions truckers face on major roads Friday afternoons and in the winter. 
Drivers cited soaring fuel prices in justifying their demands.

SALZBURG, Austria -- Albanians will learn whether they will be able travel to most EU countries without visas this autumn, says Interior Minister Lulzim Basha. 
On Sunday (August 29th), he explained that his European counterparts will decide after two meetings planned for October and November. 
Basha's comment followed talks at a conference of interior ministers from Eastern Europe in Salzburg. 
If the EU decision is positive, Albanians will be eligible for visa-free travel starting in January. 
Basha also stressed that Tirana's initiative to form a Balkan Schengen was welcomed by colleagues from the region. 
The idea is to allow citizens from the region to travel without ID cards among Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

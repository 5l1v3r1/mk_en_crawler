VIENNA, Austria -- Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik insisted on Tuesday (March 25th) that 2008 will be a decisive year for Croatia's EU integration bid.
Meeting with Croatian counterpart Gordan Jandrokovic in Vienna, Plassnik said she is certain Croatia will become the 28th member of the bloc.
She noted, however, that there are areas that still require "some housecleaning", such as the fight against corruption and reforming the judiciary and public administration.
For his part, Jandrokovic reiterated that Croatia hopes to wrap up membership negotiations this year and become a full-fledged member by 2011.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament passed amendments to the country's penal code on the first reading Thursday (16 September). 
Among other things, the legislation transfers the responsibilities of the investigators' office almost entirely to the police, in line with EU requirements. 
The bill sparked heated criticism from opposition lawmakers and passed with the votes of ruling coalition party members only. 
Recently, ambassadors from EU member countries warned the accession process might be jeopardised if penal code changes are not adopted by the end of September.

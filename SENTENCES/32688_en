BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Thursday (19 December), Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic urged Serbian President Milan Milutinovic to start negotiating with the UN war crimes tribunal on his surrender.
Djindjic said in an interview with Blic that Milutinovic must go to The Hague to answer charges in connection with the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict as soon as his term expires on 5 January.
Milutinovic says he never had any real power and thus could not be blamed for the atrocities in Kosovo.

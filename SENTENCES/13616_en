TIRANA, Albania -- The government and the IMF have reached a general agreement on further IMF assistance to the country via a new three-year programme, IMF mission chief Istvan Szekely announced at a Tirana news conference Monday (21 November). 
Common ground was found on the main macroeconomic targets for 2006-2008 as well as the reforms and policies to be implemented during that period, to guarantee macroeconomic stability, economic growth and development. 
Szekely also announced that due to the ongoing energy crisis in Albania, the GDP growth target would be revised downward to 5 per cent for the year, from the initial 5.5 per cent projection.

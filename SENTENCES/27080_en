PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Bishop of Raska and Prizren Artemije on Sunday (August 2nd) urged Kosovo Serbs to boycott the November 15th local elections. 
He described the vote as a "trap" to make Serbs recognise Kosovo's independence, adding "Serbs would never agree to back this illegal situation."
Separately Sunday, Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic said that his institution will do its best to help returnees in the village of Klobukar. 
He said he is in contact with Red Cross representatives about delivering aid to them from Serbia. 
Ivanovic will visit with them himself on Monday. 
Eighteen Serb families returned to Klobukar in mid-July.

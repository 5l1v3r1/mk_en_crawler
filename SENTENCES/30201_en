STRASBOURG, France -- European Parliament (EP) member and Special Rapporteur for Macedonia Zoran Thaler resigned on Monday (March 21st) amid a corruption scandal.
The Slovenian vowed to co-operate with anti-corruption commissions in Brussels and Ljubljana.
Thaler and two other EP members -- Romania's Adrian Severin and Austria's Ernst Strasser -- were the target of an expose by reporters from the British daily Sunday Times, who pretended to be lobbyists.
The three allegedly agreed to accept thousands of euros in exchange for tabling various amendments to EU legislation.
Strasser has also stepped down, while Severin has said he will withdraw from the Socialists group but will remain in the EP.

TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu plans to hold local elections on January 14th or January 21st, Albanian media reported Friday (November 17th), citing comments the president made during his visit to Poland this week.
He said that because the main parties failed to reach an agreement, he must use his constitutional powers to set a date himself.
The main opposition Socialist Party has threatened to boycott the vote unless it is delayed until spring.
In other news, the cabinet adopted a new bill Thursday, aimed at improving the performance of the police and strengthening civil control in the sector.

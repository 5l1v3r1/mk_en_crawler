SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, announced Thursday (6 May) that he has ordered the OSCE to investigate the financing of Republika Srpska's ruling party, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS).
"Information now available to us indicates that the SDS has been involved in financial activities that appear on the surface to be quite possibly criminal, linked to extremist nationalist groups and are certainly deeply disturbing," he told journalists.
Ashdown suspended public funding for the SDS in April because money was being diverted to war crimes suspects.

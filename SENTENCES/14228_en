BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Serbia has formally requested the extradition of Milan Lukic, the Bosnian Serb convicted of war crimes in Belgrade, a judge in Buenos Aires announced Thursday (11 August). 
Lukic, who is charged with crimes stemming from the murder of as many as 150 non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict, was arrested in Argentina on Monday on a warrant issued by the UN war crimes tribunal. 
During his appearance before the Argentine court on Thursday, Lukic said he would fight the Serbian extradition request because he fears for his life. 
Legal experts in Buenos Aires say Lukic would have been extradited to The Hague immediately, had it not been for Serbia's request.

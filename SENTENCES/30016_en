ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul on Thursday (March 24th) ordered the confiscation of an unpublished book by jailed journalist Ahmet Sik. 
Police raided a printing house searching for computer files containing the book, called "Imamin Ordusu" (The Army of the Imam), which reportedly documents the influence of an Islamic group within the police. 
They found a digital copy and erased it.
Earlier this month, Sik, was arrested along with several other journalists as part of the so-called Ergenekon investigation, into a suspected plot to topple the government. 
The arrests have sparked local protests and concern from the international community. 
Prosecutors say none of those arrests stem from the journalists' writings.

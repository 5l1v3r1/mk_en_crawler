PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic said Montenegro plans to consider for some time before deciding whether to recognise Kosovo's declaration of independence. 
"Montenegro should not hurry with its decision ... 
but should discuss its stance with the EU," he said on Tuesday (February 19th) after meeting with Republika Srpska (RS) officials in Banja Luka. 
Opposition parties in Podgorica plan to hold a protest rally Friday against Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence.
In other news, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic is expected to officially nominate Democratic Party of Socialists leader Milo Djukanovic as the country's new prime minister on Wednesday. 
The decision was announced after a meeting Tuesday between Vujanovic and representatives of the parties in parliament. 
Djukanovic would replace Zeljko Sturanovic, who resigned last month for health reasons.

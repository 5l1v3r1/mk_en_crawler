PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra said on Friday (September 3rd) that his country intends to downsize its contingent within NATO forces in Kosovo and to boost troops in Afghanistan.
The plan is to cut Czech troops in Kosovo to about 90 soldiers in the autumn or by year's end, as the situation on the ground has improved over the past two to three years, in Prague's view.
The Czech Republic has 330 soldiers serving within KFOR.

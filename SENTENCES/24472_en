ISTANBUL, Turkey -- US President Barack Obama wrapped up his visit to Turkey on Tuesday (April 7th) by meeting with a group of 100 university students in Istanbul.
In his speech, he said he is "personally committed to a new chapter in American engagement".
"We can't afford to talk past one another, to focus only on our differences, or to let the walls of mistrust go up around us," he said.
He added he believes peace in the Middle East is possible if the two sides in the conflict make the necessary compromises.

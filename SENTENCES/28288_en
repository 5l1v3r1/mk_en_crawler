ZAGREB, Croatia -- War crimes convict Branimir Glavas has filed a lawsuit against Croatian President Ivo Josipovic's decision to strip him of his major-general rank, media reported on Sunday (October 17th).
"This decision clearly violates my human and civil rights and freedoms under the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia," Glavas said in a statement.
In August, Josipovic stripped Glavas of his rank and wartime medals after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for war crimes committed against Serbian civilians during the 1991-1995 conflict.
In late July, Glavas' prison sentence was reduced from ten to eight years for the 1991 crimes committed against ethnic Serbs in the city of Osijek.
The former Croatian lawmaker, who holds both Croatian and Bosnian citizenship, left Croatia last year and fled to BiH to avoid prison.
He is currently in custody in Sarajevo.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The hearing of 11 defendants, on trial at Belgrade Second Municipal Court for allegedly helping war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, was re-launched on Monday (December 25th), due to changes in the judges' council. 
Health concerns prompted the replacement of one member. 
On Monday, the defendants again entered their pleas of not guilty. 
Four witnesses -- retired ex-Yugoslav army officer Jovan Lalovic, ex-army member Mladjan Kenjic, Republika Srpska army officer Novo Buha and businessman Vladimir Purkovic -- also testified again.
Last week, the court granted provisional release to five of the defendants -- Jovan Djogo, Stanko Ristic, Ljiljana Vaskovic, Sasa Badnjar and Blagoja Govedarica -- who had been in custody since the trial began in September. 
On Monday, Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said that decision would not jeopardise the trial.

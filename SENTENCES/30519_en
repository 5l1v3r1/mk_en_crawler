ANKARA, Turkey -- The humanitarian organisation Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) said on Friday (April 8th) it plans to send a humanitarian aid ship to Libya next week.
The IHH was in the centre of a conflict between Israel and Turkey last year, when its ship, trying to deliver aid to Gaza, was stormed by Israeli security forces in a raid that left nine activists dead.
The ship will leave from Istanbul to the Libyan port of Misrata will carry food, powdered milk, infant formula and medicines.
In other news, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan outlined a roadmap that would help restore peace in Libya.
He urged forces aligned with leader Muammar Gaddafi to withdraw from cities they have besieged, and proposed establishing humanitarian aid corridors and comprehensive democratic change.
Erdogan plans to discuss it next week in Qatar.

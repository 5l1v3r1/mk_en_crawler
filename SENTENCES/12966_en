ZAGREB, Croatia -- Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik said Thursday (31 March) that Croatia is important to Austria, which considers the European future of Southeast Europe a top foreign policy priority.
She added that several EU members were very close to suspending preparations for the start of accession talks between the EU and Croatia last month, but Austria managed to intervene.
An EU team formed to objectively assess Croatia's war crimes co-operation begins work this month and includes Plassnik.

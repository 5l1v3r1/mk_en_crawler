PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Seven former army and police officers went on trial in Bijelo Polje on Monday (June 28th) for crimes against humanity. 
They are charged with the inhumane treatment of Muslims in the northwest region of Bukovica -- near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina -- in 1992 and 1993. 
The area includes 37 villages populated mainly by Muslims. 
All seven have denied the charges.

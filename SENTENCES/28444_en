ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities issued an international arrest warrant Monday (November 15th) for the former head of Siemens' local branch, who is believed to have fled the country to avoid a corruption trial.
Volker Jung, 71, failed to report to a police station on the Aegean island of Paros at the beginning of November, as he was obliged to do to avoid pre-trial detention.
The suspect was not allowed to leave the country.
Prosecutors in Athens ordered an investigation Monday into how he was able to escape.
Jung, a German national, is the most senior of seven former Siemens officials charged last year with bribery and money laundering, over a 1990s contract with leading telecom operator OTE.
Two other suspects have also fled abroad.

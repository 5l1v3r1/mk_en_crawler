BRUSSELS, Belgium -- No real progress has been made towards abolishing visas for the citizens of the Western Balkan countries travelling to the EU, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said on Monday (March 16th).
His country currently holds the EU presidency.
Speaking after an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels, Schwarzenberg said the road towards liberalisation seemed bumpy and the EU remained divided on the issue.
Italy and Slovenia reportedly proposed faster removal of visas for the Western Balkans but did not command enough support.
Serbia hopes to be included in the so-called White Schengen List this year.
In an interview with the newspaper Dnevnik, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he believes Serbia should obtain eased visa travel rules as soon as possible.
In other news Monday, Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic announced that Serbia had asked the IMF for 3 billion euros in assistance during talks on a new standby arrangement.
Dinkic said the country hoped to get 2 billion euros this year and another 1 billion euros in 2010 under the new two-year programme.

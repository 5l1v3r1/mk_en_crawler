SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak met on Monday (September 3rd) with the country's main Serb and Bosniak leaders -- Milorad Dodik and Haris Silajdjic, respectively -- regarding police reform.
Both emerged with softer stances on the matter.
Contrary to his earlier statements, Dodik told reporters that the draft proposal by Lajcak provides a good basis for negotiations, adding he was satisfied with clarifications the high representative had offered.
Silajdjic indicated he is ready to negotiate, adding it is likely that after more than three years of fruitless talks, BiH would finally get police restructuring.
After talking to Lajcak, Dodik met with outgoing US Ambassador Douglas McElhaney.
They discussed both police reform and constitutional reform.

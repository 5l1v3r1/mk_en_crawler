NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Hammering out a common strategy regarding ties between Turkey and the EU in the coming months was the main topic of discussions between Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and visiting Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis in Nicosia on Sunday (October 8th). 
In comments to the Athens newspaper Kathimerini, Bakoyannis suggested that if Turkey does not open its air and naval space to Greek Cypriot planes and vessels by the end of this year, its accession process might be jeopardised.

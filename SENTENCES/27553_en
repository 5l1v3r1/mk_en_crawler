PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG), a non-profit organisation providing free legal assistance to developing states and sub-state entities involved in conflicts, says Kosovo institutions to balance the country's resources between the Serbs and other minorities. 
"Kosovo enjoys one of the best legislations for minorities, but the implementation of these documents remains a challenge," PILPG members said after a two-week visit to Kosovo, focusing on non-Serb minorities who have complained of neglect by authorities.

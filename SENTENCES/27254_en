BUCHAREST, Romania -- Judges in Bucharest announced on Monday (August 31st) that they will stop work for three hours every day, starting on Thursday, to protest a government decision to cut their salaries. 
In an effort to slash public spending, Romania has decided to remove a number of bonuses paid to public employees and freeze wages in the public sector. 
For judges in particular, this means abolishing their bonuses for workplace stress, which is roughly half of their net wage. 
Mona Pivniceru, president of the Romanian Magistrates Association, criticised the government's move and warned that protests will continue every day. 
Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu says the work slowdown is "illegal".

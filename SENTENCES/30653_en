TIRANA, Albania -- The two main political parties, the opposition Socialist Party (SP) and the ruling Democratic Party (DP), have started a fresh row less than two months before the May 8th local elections.
SP lawmakers on Sunday (March 13th) accused the ruling DP of involvement in an illegal oil trade scheme spanning years.
Last Friday, police arrested 11 officials accused in it -- selling raw petrol on the domestic market in violation of the laws.
The opposition rushed to link the scheme with members of the government.
In reaction, the Finance Ministry said it started investigating in 2008 to shed light on the scandal.
The office blamed the opposition for allowing illegal oil business to blossom during its tenure.

TRIPOLI, Libya -- The son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Seif al-Islam, says it was obvious the medics would be pardoned when they reached Bulgaria.
In a Monday (July 30th) Reuters interview, he also said conspiracy theorizing about a Western or Israeli plot had prolonged the case.
"We created that story, the Libyans.
They found that there were Bulgarians and a Palestinian doctor -- it means there is a connection with Israel, Mossad, with Western intelligence.
There is a conspiracy.
They build up a story.
They forced the Bulgarians to admit to something and then here we are, we have a story, we have conspiracy, we got that complicated file which we carried for, what, eight years," Islam said.

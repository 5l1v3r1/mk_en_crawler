PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said Thursday (1 June) that the UN administration is preparing to leave Kosovo, once the final status of the province is determined.
His comment followed a meeting with Prime Minister Agim Ceku in Pristina.
According to Jessen-Petersen, a departure would be logical once Kosovo's status is confirmed via a new UN resolution, making the current Resolution 1244, which established UNMIK's authority in 1999, irrelevant.
Also Thursday, Jessen-Petersen praised the promulgation of the Kosovo government's updated return policies and procedures, aimed at boosting the return of displaced persons, particularly Serbs.
The document was adopted after eight months of consultations with international experts, minority groups and civil associations.
In other news, Serbian President Boris Tadic spoke with Jessen-Petersen by phone late Thursday, about the murder of a local Serb, gunned down Wednesday night in a roadside attack near Zvecan, in northern Kosovo.
Belgrade authorities say the attack is one more example of ethnic violence targeting Serbs in the province.

VIENNA, Austria -- Participants in Thursday's (7 September) talks on Kosovo decentralisation issues failed to cover all the issues in the agenda and agreed to continue discussions in Vienna on 15 September.
Slobodan Samardzic, co-ordinator for the Serbian delegation, said negotiators still need to discuss the major question:
the exact number and borders of Serb municipalities in Kosovo.
Both he and Lufti Haziri, head of the Pristina negotiation team, said the meeting was held in a positive atmosphere.
Talks Friday are focusing on issues related to the protection of cultural and religious heritage and ethnic communities' rights.

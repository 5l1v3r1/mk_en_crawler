ANKARA, Turkey -- The armed forces guarantee both the country's republic status and democracy, Land Forces Commander General Aytac Yalman said Sunday (31 August). 
During a reception marking Victory Day, Yalman said the latest surveys suggest 88 per cent of Turkey's population have confidence in the armed forces.
In other developments Sunday, Chief of General Staff of Turkish Armed Forces General Hilmi Ozkok said that the US military command was considering designating a sector in Iraq where peacekeeping troops would be under Turkish command. 
Still unclear is the location of the region.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The OSCE mission in Kosovo has adopted instructions on terminology to be used following Kosovo's declaration of independence in February, local media reported on Wednesday (May 7th). 
Administrative crossing points in the north will be renamed border crossings, "interim institutions of self-government" will be referred to as "Kosovo institutions", and the "unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo" is replaced by the term "declaration of independence by the Kosovo parliament".
OSCE officials deny that the new terminology means official recognition of Kosovo. 
"The organisation consists of 56 states and one should be careful not to trample on anyone's toes. 
We want to be completely neutral," spokesperson Elli Flen said.
In other news, Lithuania recognised Kosovo's independence on Tuesday, becoming the 39th country to do so.

NEW YORK, United States -- Russia and China, veto-wielding UN Security Council members, have expressed strong concern over Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia.
Both countries called for talks between Belgrade and Pristina, aimed at finding an acceptable solution to their dispute.
The Security Council held a closed-door session after Kosovo announced its independence on Sunday (February 17th).
The 15-member Council will meet again Monday to continue discussions, and will hear from Serbian President Boris Tadic.
In an interview for the BBC on Sunday, UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker said he is still waiting for guidelines from New York on how to proceed.
Asked by CNN on Monday about the possibility of Serbia introducing economic sanctions on Kosovo, Ruecker said the public has begun preparing for a possible embargo.

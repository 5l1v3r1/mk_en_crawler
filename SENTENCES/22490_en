SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US government has information confirming that Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were in Serbia, US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues Clint Williamson said on Monday (July 14th) in an interview with the Sarajevo-based newspaper Oslobodjenje.
Williamson pointed out that the arrest of the two fugitives and their transfer to The Hague war crimes tribunal depend mostly on the readiness of Serbian authorities to co-operate.
"All information we have been receiving recently makes us believe that Ratko Mladic was on Serbian territory, and there are strong indications that Karadzic was also on the territory of Serbia," Williamson said.
He added that failure to resolve the issue soon would make it a source of regional instability.

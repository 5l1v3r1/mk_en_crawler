BUCHAREST, Romania -- A local Roma NGO, the Romani Criss Association, has complained to the National Council for Fighting Discrimination about a comment Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu made at the weekend. 
In Brasov, he reportedly said that the Interior Ministry plans to dispatch a team of police to Italy to help catch and repatriate Romanian gypsies, who commit crimes there.
The Romanian government's press office issued a statement on Wednesday (July 4th), saying Tariceanu's comment had been distorted, and that he and the cabinet had always backed activities aimed at integrating the Roma in society.

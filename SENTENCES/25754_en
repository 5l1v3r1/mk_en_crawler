TIRANA, Albania -- The Transparency International office in Albania (TIA) said on Monday (September 21st) that it is concerned about the transparency of financing political parties received during the June general elections. 
The TIA said parties continue to hide their finances and urged them to end the "total silence" on the issue. 
"There is information available about the funds provided by the state budget, but no data is given on the private donations," the TIA said in its report.

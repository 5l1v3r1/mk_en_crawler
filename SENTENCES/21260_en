BELGRADE, Serbia -- The country's war crimes prosecutor's office is co-operating intensively with Norway and Sweden regarding cases of war crimes against Serbs in Bosnia during the 1990s, spokesman Bruno Vekaric said on Thursday (August 28th).
The co-operation covers investigations into crimes committed against Serb civilians in a prison camp in Dretelj, southern Bosnia in 1992, Vekaric said.
He added that co-operation with Norwegian authorities started in March 2007 when an investigation was launched against Mirsad Repak, now a Norwegian citizen.
Charged with committing war crimes against Serb prisoners in Dretelj, his trial opened on Wednesday in Norway.

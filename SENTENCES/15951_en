BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Martti Ahtisaari, the chief UN mediator for talks on Kosovo's future status, told reporters Wednesday (October 18th) that he would present his plan for the future of the province by the end of the year, as planned. 
Ahtisaari added that he would discuss the blueprint at meetings with the international Contact Group in late October and early November. 
The Serb and ethnic Albanian parties will be able to comment on the draft before it is approved by the UN Security Council. 
In Brussels, Ahtisaari met with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who reaffirmed the Alliance's continued commitment to preserving security and stability in Kosovo.
In other news Wednesday, KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather met with Montenegrin Army chief General Colonel Jovan Lakicevic in Podgorica, discussing issues related to bilateral co-operation. 
This was the first such meeting since Podgorica declared independence in May.

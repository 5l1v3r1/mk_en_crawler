SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Police arrested two suspects, Radoje Lalovic and Soniboj Skilevic, on Tuesday (November 18th). 
They face charges of committing war crimes against civilians in Kula prison during the 1990s. 
They worked as managers at the prison between May 1992 and December 1995. 
Prosecutors say the pair persecuted non-Serb civilians, as well as participating in the torture and murder of prisoners.

TIRANA, Albania -- Belgium has warned Albania that it is being monitored on the way it is implementing visa liberalisation with EU countries. 
On Monday (November 29th), Belgian Emigration Minister Melchior Wathelet called on the government in Tirana to continue its public information campaign regarding travel to the EU. 
"It is Albania's and Albanians' turn to respect the pact we have reached," Wathelet said, adding that those who break the rules will be returned home. 
Albanians will be able to travel visa-free to EU countries starting on December 15th.

TIRANA, Albania -- The US strongly supports Albania's NATO membership bid, Senator Richard Lugar, chairman of the US Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations, said Friday (25 August) on a visit to Tirana.
He said he hopes that Albania will be among the countries invited to become members of the Alliance in 2008.
While meeting with President Alfred Moisiu, Lugar lauded government efforts to meet NATO membership criteria, especially those against corruption and improvement of the economy and living standards.
He said that the 2006 Riga Summit -- which will be held in November -- would focus on NATOâs transformation to confront new challenges like terrorism, unstable states and weapons races.

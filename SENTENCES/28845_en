PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Pristina's District Court found former Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci and his advisor Ahmet Alishani guilty of abusing their official positions on Wednesday (November 10th). 
Daci was given an 18-months suspended sentence, and a suspended punishment of six months in prison was imposed on Alishani. 
Daci was convicted of misappropriating public funds in 2005 when he bought two pairs of spectacles worth 590 euros and paid 950 euros for dental care using state money. 
At the same time, Daci was banned from exercising a public function for two years. 
Daci's opposition Democratic League of Dardania has slammed the whole process as politically motivated.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Meeting in Zagreb on Tuesday (29 March), Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and his Macedonian counterpart, Vlado Buckovski, jointly expressed hopes that their countries -- together with Albania -- would be invited to join NATO in 2006.
The three states are participating in the so-called Adriatic Charter initiative, which is aimed at boosing the process of Euro-Atlantic integration.
Buckovski said the accession of Macedonia and Croatia would strengthen NATO's southern flank and facilitate the progress of other Balkan nations towards membership in the Alliance.
NATO spokesman James Appathurai said Croatia would have to prove it was co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal before any invitation is issued.
In other news, the first session of the EU-Macedonia joint parliamentary committee began Wednesday in Skopje.
The agenda includes topics related to Macedonia's application for official EU candidate status and implementation of the Ohrid Peace Accords.

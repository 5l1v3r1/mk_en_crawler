BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anti-corruption Department (DNA) on Monday (December 20th) filed tax evasion charges against four people, including two former high-ranking finance ministry officials.
The case involves Romanian company Galaxy Tobacco, which failed to pay taxes worth 44m euros for the transfer of about 1,000 tonnes of tobacco to the Italian company CTS Ltd between 2007 and 2009.
Finance ministry officials, including Gratiela Iordache, a state secretary at the ministry in 2009-2010, allegedly helped the company by providing documents that exempted it from paying taxes.

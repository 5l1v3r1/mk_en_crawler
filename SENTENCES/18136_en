ZAGREB, Croatia -- Australia has extradited a Croatian man wanted for war crimes by Zagreb. 
Antun Gudelj, 59, who holds dual Croatian-Australian citizenship, was taken to a detention facility in the city of Osijek on Sunday (July 15th) where his trial is due to take place, likely in September. 
He is accused of killing a police chief and two of his aides in eastern Croatia shortly before the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict. 
The officer, Josip Reihl-Kir, was trying to mediate between Croats and Serbs in a bid to defuse tensions that eventually led to the armed conflict. 
In 1994, Gudelj was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but was set free as a result of a general amnesty in 1997. 
Croatia's Constitutional Court ordered a retrial in 2001.

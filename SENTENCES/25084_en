ZAGREB, Croatia -- About 4,000 people gathered in Zagreb on Saturday (December 26th) to protest the arrest of five former members of a special police unit suspected of committing war crimes against civilians during the 1991-1995 war in Croatia. 
The protest brought together former police officers who served in the unit and war veterans, many of whom wore uniforms and waved army flags. 
The rally, which lasted about three hours, started in a suburb, went through the city and ended at the central cathedral. 
"We want to tell everyone to stop criminalising the veterans and the war in Croatia," Josip Klemm, head of the association of former special police officers, told the crowed. 
The arrests were announced on December 19th as part of an investigation into war crimes against Serb civilians committed in the southern village of Grubori, as the war in Croatia ended. 
Three of officers are suspected of killing a group of mainly elderly Serb civilians; the other two are suspected of covering up the crime.

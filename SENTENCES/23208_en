ZAGREB, Croatia -- Retired Croatian General Mirko Norac was sentenced on Friday (May 30th) to seven years in prison for war crimes against Serb prisoners of war and civilians during a military operation in 1993.
The other defendant in the case, retired General Rahim Ademi, was acquitted of all charges.
Norac and Ademi were charged with war crimes after troops under their command killed 23 civilians and five prisoners of war during the 1993 Medak Pocket military operation.
Elsewhere Friday, the war crimes court in Bosnia and Herzegovina sentenced three Bosnian Serbs to prison for the murder of around 100 Bosnian Muslims and Croats during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Dusko Knezevic, Zeljko Mejakic and Momcilo Gruban received 31 years, 21 years and 11 years in prison respectively.
They were charged with murder, illegal detention, torture, sexual assault, persecution and other crimes against civilians in the Omarska and Keraterm detention camps near the northwest town of Prijedor.
Also Friday, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak ordered passports removed from 16 Bosniaks suspected of aiding fugitive war crimes indictee Stojan Zupljanin.
Lajcak did not reveal the names of the 16, to avoid tipping them off.
Zupljanin was first indicted by The Hague war crimes tribunal in 1999 for crimes against Croats and Muslims in the eastern part of BiH during the 1992-1995 conflict.

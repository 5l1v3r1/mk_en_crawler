PRISTINA, Kosovo -- New Zealand is the latest country to recognise Kosovo's independence, just three weeks before hearings begin at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of its unilaterally-declared independence in February 2008. 
New Zealand is the 63rd international recognition of Kosovo. 
Serbia filed the case with the ICJ, insisting the declaration of independence was illegal.

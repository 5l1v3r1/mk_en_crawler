LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Prime Minister Borut Pahor says he hopes to bring the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo together at an EU-Balkans summit that Slovenia is organising with Croatia on March 20th. 
Pahor, however, described the effort as being "to some extent a mission impossible" on Thursday (March 11th). 
"Many people believe that if anybody can do it, it's us," Pahor told journalists after a weekly cabinet session in Ljubljana. 
Pahor and his Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor decided in January to organise the conference in an effort to accelerate the region's EU integration. 
Serbian leaders have balked at attending any event that includes leaders from Kosovo, saying it would amount to de facto recognition of Kosovo's independence.

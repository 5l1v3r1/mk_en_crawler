BUCHAREST, Romania -- The cabinet announced on Thursday (23 March) that it is working to abolish the so-called Dracula Park project, which was approved by the previous administration.
The ministers are trying to cancel the deal with the contractor after recent audits by the Government Control Authority uncovered several violations, including expansion from the initial tourism and theme park to an "industrial park".

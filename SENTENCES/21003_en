ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party plans to unveil its draft for a new constitution by the end of the year, a senior party official said on Monday (September 3rd). 
AKP Vice President Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat said the new charter will uphold human rights and civil liberties. 
While the AKP might be able to secure the 367 votes needed in parliament for adoption of the new constitution, it plans to call a referendum so that voters can decide in a direct ballot, Firat added.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Two more people -- retired Serbia-Montenegro Army pilot Stanko Ristic, 50, and his son Predrag, 23 -- have been arrested in Serbia for allegedly helping war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic evade capture, according to Belgrade media reports Thursday (20 April). 
The media cited a statement from the Belgrade Second Municipal Court, confirming that the two are being detained for a month. 
Friday's edition of the daily Blic reported that the Ristics are believed to have helped Mladic hide for the past six years. 
Blic also said the investigation against them likely would be merged with one under way against two other suspected Mladic aides, former Republika Srpska Army officers Jovo Djogo and Sasa Badnjar.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government has decided to take an emergency 2 billion-euro loan from private banks in an attempt to deal with its huge budget deficit and growing debts, local media reported on Wednesday (December 16th).
The loan will have an annual interest rate of 2.5% -- significantly lower than the average interest rate of 3.3% -- will be paid off in five years.
The government is expected to receive the money on January 4th.
Meanwhile, the government and opposition met to discuss the economic crisis following Prime Minister George Papandreou's announcement of stiff spending cuts.
He asked all parties to support the measures to pull the country out of the crisis.
Papandreou says party leaders reached an agreement on several key points despite ideological differences.
One rallying point with which all party leaders agreed is to tackle significant levels of corruption.

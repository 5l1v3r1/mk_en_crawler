SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal will close in 2010 even if the two top fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, have not been prosecuted by then, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said during a recent trip to Sarajevo.
She noted that the UN Security Council appears unlikely to change its position that all trials must end in 2008, allowing two more years for appeals.
The prosecutor also acknowledged that cost is a concern:
the tribunal costs some $100m a year to operate.

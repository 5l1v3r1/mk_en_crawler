PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Justice Minister Miras Radovic said on Wednesday (June 30th) that Montenegro is willing to negotiate and sign extradition agreements regarding people suspected of organised crime and corruption with countries in the region.
The constitution bans the extradition of Montenegrin citizens to other countries, except in cases covered by international agreements.
Serbia and Croatia signed an extradition deal of their own this week.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Justice Minister Cemil Cicek says the government is not ready to decide whether to send peacekeepers to neighbouring Iraq, as requested by the United States. 
Cicek, who also serves as government spokesman, said that Monday's (25 August) cabinet meeting focused more on the latest unrest in northern Iraq than on the potential deployment. 
Recent attacks have killed 11 Turkmen.
In other news Monday, the outgoing secretary general of Turkey's National Security Council (MGK) said the 7th EU adaptation package has rendered the MGK ineffectual. 
Gen Tuncer Kilinc said that while it still exists legally, the MGK has no real influence over the political decision-making process.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia's President Stipe Mesic asserted Saturday (11 October) that according to intelligence service information, General Ante Gotovina is not in Croatia.
Mesic's comment came in response to a recent report from UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, saying that neither Mesic nor Prime Minister Ivica Racan confirmed the refugee general is not in the country.
Asked about the possibility of other indictments against Croatians, Mesic said the government is co-operating with the tribunal.
At the same time, he said the country faces more important, domestic problems it has to address.
In other news, Croatian Defence Minister Zeljka Antunovic rejected the idea of forming a joint Balkan military brigade, arguing that co-operation should start at a smaller scale, possibly first in the military industrial sector.
She also said Croatia would be more interested in forming a military unit with its Western neighbours, such as Hungary, Slovenia and Italy.

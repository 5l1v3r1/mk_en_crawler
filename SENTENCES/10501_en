ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis said in an interview published Sunday (17 October) that a national consensus exists in his country concerning Turkey's bid for EU membership. 
He said Ankara should not be rejected and as a member would serve as "a positive force for peace, stability and prosperity" in the Balkans. 
Molyviatis added that the ruling New Democracy party and the opposition Socialists have agreed to work together to help Turkey join the EU.

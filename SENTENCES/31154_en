SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov on Monday (January 3rd) vetoed the electoral law, adopted by parliament on December 22nd.
Parvanov says the bill limits the citizen's right to vote and sidesteps the principle of decentralisation of power.
His move was supported by Parvanov's former party -- the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) -- while the minority ruling GERB has not yet commented on it.
The president's veto is not binding and only requires that the bill be discussed and voted again in parliament.
However, the BSP will likely challenge the text in front of the Constitutional Court, which could have more serious consequences.
Adopting a new electoral law was among the campaign promises of the current government.

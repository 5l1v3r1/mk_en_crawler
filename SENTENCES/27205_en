SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MANU) decided on Wednesday (September 30th) to stop distribution of its controversial new encyclopaedia and to correct sections of the book. 
The encyclopaedia's editorial board will make the changes, in co-operation with ethnic Albanian MANU members and scientists from minority communities in Macedonia. 
The portrayal of Albanians in the encyclopaedia caused an uproar in Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania.

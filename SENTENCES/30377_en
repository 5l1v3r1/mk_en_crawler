TIRANA, Albania -- Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday (February 18th) in downtown Tirana for an anti-government demonstration.
The rally, organised by the opposition Socialist Party, was held nearly a month after another big demonstration in the capital turned deadly, with four people killed in clashes between anti-government protestors and police.
Participants in Friday's demonstration called for early elections, accusing the government of corruption.

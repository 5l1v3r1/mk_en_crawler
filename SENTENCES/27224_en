SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament ratified the contract Wednesday (February 3rd) for constructing the Nabucco gas pipeline.
The project -- involving Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria -- will carry gas from Central Asia to the EU, bypassing Russia.
According to Economy Minister Traycho Traykov, the pipeline is expected to be operational after 2015 and will reach full capacity by 2020.
Every political party in parliament supported the project.
Nabucco will ensure access to gas from the Caspian region and the Middle East.
It was initiated after the Russian gas crisis in January 2008.
Hungary has also ratified the deal.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Talks among the main BiH parties on crucial constitutional reforms are expected to resume this week.
BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic said leaders of the main parties would meet within days in an effort to hammer out remaining sticking points, on the basis of recommendations made recently by the Venice Commission.
The parties had pledged to agree on reforms by March.
Separately, the head of the European Commission Delegation in BiH, Michael Humphreys, said in an interview Monday that BiH authorities have a legal and international obligation to adjust the country's constitution in line with European conventions sealed by BiH.
He reiterated that agreement is expected quickly.

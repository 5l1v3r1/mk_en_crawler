ATHENS, Greece -- An extreme leftist terrorist group has claimed responsibility for an early Friday (October 30th) bomb attack on a building in Athens where a European Parliament (EP) member of the opposition New Democracy party lives. 
The Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire said in an internet posting that the attack was to protest Marietta Yanakou's actions while she was justice minister from 2004 to 2007. 
A series of reforms she implemented provoked a wave of protests among Greek students. 
Twenty minutes before Friday's explosion, two anonymous calls were made to local media outlets, warning of the attack. 
The blast caused only minor damage. 
Yanakou was elected to the EP in June.

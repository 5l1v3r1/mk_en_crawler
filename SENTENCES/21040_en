ZAGREB, Croatia -- The health of war crimes indictee Branimir Glavas has deteriorated sharply and doctors are not sure whether he will survive the next three or four days, Glavas' lawyer, Veljko Miljevic, said on Wednesday (January 2nd).
Glavas, who has been on hunger strike for the past two months and has lost 25kg, has been transferred from the prison hospital to one in Dubrava.
His lawyer said he has requested Glavas' release for health reasons, but the request has been rejected by the court, which ruled Glavas has done this to himself.
He and six co-defendants, who have repeatedly staged hunger strikes to protest their detention, have been charged with war crimes committed in the eastern Osijek region, in connection with the 1991 torture and murder of ten ethnic Serb civilians.

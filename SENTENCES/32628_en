WASHINGTON, United States -- The Treasury Department decided Friday (27 December) to release Yugoslav assets frozen in US banks. 
The assets were blocked over the ten-year period of international sanctions against Yugoslavia, beginning in 1992. 
Still unclear is the exact amount being unlocked.
In other news, Serbia's election commission is insisting that the term of incumbent Serbian President Milan Milutinovic expires 29 December rather than the publicised date of 5 January. 
Milutinovic, a war crimes indictee who is expected to report to the UN tribunal as soon as he steps down, took the oath on 29 December 1997. 
The commission says Parliamentary Speaker Natasa Micic should assume the post as early as Monday.
Meanwhile, Nenad Canak, parliamentary speaker of the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, says former Bosnian Serb Army leader Ratko Mladic is in Yugoslavia. 
Belgrade authorities have repeatedly denied that Mladic, wanted by the UN tribunal on war crimes charges, is in the country.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The chief of the Sarajevo Cantonal Prosecution, Branko Sljivar, is urging Republika Srpska missing persons associations to submit all data and documentation related to missing Serbs from the Sarajevo region.
His comments came in a statement published in Saturday's (13 May) edition of Dnevni avaz.
Instead of exchanging critical remarks with the Federation of BiH government and haggling over the alleged numbers of war victims, missing persons associations would do better to submit the relevant documents to the prosecution so that the truth can be established, Sljivar said.
According to the prosecution chief, 13 new charges related to alleged crimes committed against ethnic Serbs have been filed since 4 January and official proceedings are expected to be launched.

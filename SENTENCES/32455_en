ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraqi Kurds will support the presence of US troops in Iraq, but not Turkish ones, according to the head of foreign relations for the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), Hoshyar Zebari.
In an interview Wednesday (19 March) for the <I>Al-Jazeera</I> satellite channel, Zebari said his party -- one of the two main Kurdish factions controlling northern Iraq -- does not see Turkey as part of the international coalition.
KDP is highly suspicious of any possible deployment of Turkish troops in northern Iraq.
In response, US officials have promised that whatever forces are deployed in that territory would be placed under coalition command.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo is poised to begin reclaiming its properties in former Yugoslav republics, Koha Ditore reported on Monday (April 25th).
The Foreign Ministry and the Privatisation Agency of Kosovo have established a commission that has identified Kosovo's property abroad, including 172 properties of former social enterprises, most of them in Serbia.
The properties consist of factories, shops and land that used to belong to Kosovo companies during the existence of former Yugoslavia.
The foreign ministry says that the reclaiming process will begin with the 42 properties in Montenegro, a country that has established good relations with Pristina institutions.

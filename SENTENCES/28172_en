TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) on Tuesday (August 17th) urged all political parties to work for electoral reforms.
Deputy leader Petrit Vasili said that any effort to improve electoral standards would be useless unless the elections code is improved.
He reminded politicians that they are constantly speaking about high electoral standards, but improving them requires political will.
The SMI says reforms should start in September.

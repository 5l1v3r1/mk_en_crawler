BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu announced on Friday (April 11th) he is resigning over the January death of a Romanian national held in a Polish prison. 
Claudiu Crulic, 33, died in hospital in Poland after a two-month hunger strike following his arrest in Warsaw for allegedly stealing a wallet. 
Insisting he was innocent, he sent numerous letters to the Romanian Consulate asking for help but received none. 
His friends say he was not even in Poland when the wallet was stolen.
Romania's foreign ministry learned of his case only recently. 
Cioroianu described his resignation as "a matter of honour".

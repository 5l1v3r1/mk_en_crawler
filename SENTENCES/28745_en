BELGRADE, Serbia -- The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said on Sunday (April 11th) that its new goal is to be represented in the government that will emerge after the next elections. 
As of now, the party usually backs the ruling coalition in key EU integration and economic reforms, but has rejected the possibility of joining the government for the time being. 
While presenting the party's new platform, LDP leader Cedomir Jovanovic said he expects elections next year, a year earlier than scheduled. 
The party says EU integration remains its priority but it would also insist on Serbia's quick entry into NATO. 
As for the economy, the party would advocate improving the business climate, strengthening competition and ending existing monopolies.

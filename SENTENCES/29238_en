BELGRADE, Serbia -- Malta has ratified Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic announced on Friday (July 2nd), making Malta the second country after Spain to do so.
According to an earlier announcement, Italy has started the ratification process, while Austria, Denmark, Finland and Poland plan to launch the procedure in the autumn.
The European Council invited the 27 EU member states to begin approving the pre-membership agreement with Serbia on June 14th, following a positive report by Hague war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz.
The process, which could take a year or two, must be completed in order for Serbia to receive EU candidate status.

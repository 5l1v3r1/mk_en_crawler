BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu warned on Sunday (9 July) that progress made in judicial reforms has been "very small", as indicated by responses to opinion polls on the subject.
Marking Justice Day at Snagov Palace, Basescu said things had only evolved slightly.
For her part, Justice Minister Monica Macovei said a lack of public confidence in the judicial system remains a major problem.
Meanwhile, a new poll by the INSOMAR agency suggests that Basescu remains the most trusted politician in Romania.
His numbers took a hit, however, from ongoing quarrels with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu over the future of Romanian troops in Iraq.

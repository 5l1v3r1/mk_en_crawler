SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- British Minister for Europe Geoff Hoon urged BiH on Tuesday (November 7th) to speed up reforms to bring the country closer to membership in NATO and the EU.
Changes were blocked by months of campaigning for the October general election.
Urgent measures are needed to overcome the delay, Hoon said during a brief visit to Sarajevo, noting that BiH must first merge the police forces of its two entities.
This is a condition that must be met to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Later Tuesday, Hoon visited Kosovo for talks with UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker and political representatives of the Albanian and Serb communities.

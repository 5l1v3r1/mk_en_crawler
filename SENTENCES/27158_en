SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb lawmakers on Thursday (October 1st) backed the Republika Srpska (RS) government position on High Representative Valentin Inzko's latest decisions regarding the state-controlled electricity company, Elektroprenos. 
The RS cabinet decided not to implement Inzko's decisions of September 18th, aimed at ensuring the continued operations of the company. 
Inzko had extended the mandate of the company's board, which expired last year, and ordered the board to appoint a new general director. 
Bosnian Serbs have been boycotting the company's work for over a year, while trying to form their own power grid operator. 
The lawmakers concluded that Bosnian Serb representatives should leave BiH's state institutions if Inzko again imposes decisions concerning Elektroprenos.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- EU security chief Javier Solana is calling for intensified efforts in Serbia-Montenegro to launch talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
Solana, who arrived Tuesday (19 July) on a two-day visit to the federal union, met with Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. 
Aides say it was noted during the meeting that the Stabilisation and Association Process should be given priority over every other issue, including a possible Montenegrin independence referendum. 
On Wednesday, Solana meets with Serbia-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, as well as Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. 
Later, he travels on to Pristina.

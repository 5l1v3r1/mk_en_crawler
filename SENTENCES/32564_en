BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana says Belgrade's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains crucial to boosting relations with the EU. 
Solana met with federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic in Brussels on Wednesday (5 March) to discuss prospects for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. 
EU foreign policy chief Chris Patten, who also met with Svilanovic, reiterated Solana's stance. 
Patten is to travel to Belgrade late next week for further discussions.

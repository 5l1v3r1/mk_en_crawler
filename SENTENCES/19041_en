TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu has set January 20th as the date of Albania's next municipal elections. 
A press release issued by his office Saturday (December 2nd) voiced the president's deep concern over the continued failure of the Albanian political powers to agree on crucial electoral reforms. 
He noted the importance of the municipal elections for Albania's Euro-Atlantic prospects.
The Central Election Commission, meanwhile, drew lots Friday regarding the appointment of the seventh members of local election panels. 
The two main parties have been squabbling over the issue for months.

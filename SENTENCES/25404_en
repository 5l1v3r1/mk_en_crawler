BELGRADE, Serbia -- War veterans from Leskovac and Nis blocked railways to Sofia and Skopje at the weekend, demanding back pay for their service during the Kosovo conflict. 
They unblocked the rail sections late Saturday (January 23rd) after the government decided that it could use police to guarantee normal rail and road traffic because of economic damage caused by the blockades. 
Labour and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic met with the protesters and will meet with them again this week.
On Sunday, about 300 war veterans from Valjevo protested outside the railway station there. 
In part, they want better compensation for disabled veterans and for the families of those killed during the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. 
The protesters also want their housing problems addressed and want a law on veterans passed.

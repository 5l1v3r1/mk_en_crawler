ANKARA, Turkey -- Sources within the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) say that anticipated changes to Article 301 of the Penal Code have been shelved, the Cihan news agency reported on Monday (March 10th).
The government has been accused of dragging its feet on reforming Article 301, which criminalises any denigration of the state, government and military.
The EU has long regarded the article as an obstacle to free speech and has insisted on its amendment.
Cihan says the amendment is being shelved because the opposition Nationalist Movement Party, which recently supported the AKP's constitutional amendment to lift a ban on headscarves in university, opposes any changes to the text.
The primary opposition Republican People's Party and the Democratic Left Party also oppose changing Article 301.

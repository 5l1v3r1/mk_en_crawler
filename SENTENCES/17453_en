BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling National Liberal Party's (PNL) political bureau rejected a proposal Monday (May 21st) by PNL Bucharest leader Ludovic Orban to leave the government.
Orban suggested it Sunday, after a referendum to impeach President Traian Basescu failed.
PNL was one of the parties backing impeachment.
The main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), which initiated the referendum, experienced fallout -- on Monday, the media reported that senior PSD officials Vasile Puscas, Ludovica Parvu, Ion Stan and Liviu Dragnea had resigned.
The Constitutional Court is expected to confirm the results of the vote, paving the way for Basescu to resume his presidential duties.

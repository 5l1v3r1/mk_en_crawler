TIRANA, Albania -- The country's political parties might be close to settling a lengthy dispute over composition of the electoral commission. 
On Wednesday (13 October), the ruling Socialist Party submitted its proposal regarding the composition to parliament. 
The opposition Democratic Party reportedly approved the formula, aimed at balancing representation. 
Electoral reform has stalled due to the disagreement over the commission's structure.

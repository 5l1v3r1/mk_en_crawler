SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Right-wing opposition parties left Wednesday's (May 2nd) parliament session, in protest of the majority's decision to exclude from the daily agenda a bill that terms the mass killings of Armenians in Turkey during World War I a genocide. 
The bill was proposed by the ultranationalist Attack coalition. 
Deputies from other rightist parties joined Attack MPs in the walkout, accusing the ruling coalition of violating the legislature's regulations and acting unfairly for the sake of inter-cabinet relations. 
The ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms is a junior government partner.

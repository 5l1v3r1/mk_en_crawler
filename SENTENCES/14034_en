ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish doctors are continuing to investigate the death of a 12-year-old girl in the city of Van, though initial tests suggested she did not have bird flu. 
The girl's brother tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the virus, and was reported to be in critical condition in the same hospital. 
He is the 19th person known to have contracted the virus in Turkey. 
Three of the patients have died and three have fully recovered. 
The government, meanwhile, announced that it was extending its culling programme to new parts of the country in a bid to stem the epidemic.

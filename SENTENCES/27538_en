PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX Chief Prosecutor Johannes van Vreeswijk said on Tuesday (June 29th) that ongoing investigations will result in the arrest of those involved in corruption and organised crime. 
"The list is very long," van Vreeswijk said at a press conference in the outskirts of Pristina. 
He admitted that there has been political interference since late April, when EULEX police raided the offices of the transport and telecommunications ministry and Minister Fatmir Limaj's home, in connection with a two-year corruption probe. 
Kosovo's chief prosecutor, Ismet Kabashi, said that cases involving corruption and organised crime will be handled with priority, noting that corruption and money laundering cases are the hardest to prosecute.

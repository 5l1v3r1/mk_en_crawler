SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MANU) sacked Blaze Ristovski, editor-in-chief of the first Macedonian encyclopaedia, and his team Thursday (November 5th). 
The vote, after several hours of debate was 45-1, with two abstentions. 
MANU also decided that within a month, a new editorial board will be up and running, and will either correct controversial parts of the book or start fresh with a brand new encyclopaedia. 
Distribution of the current version has been halted. 
Some texts sparked angry reactions among Albanian intellectuals and politicians inside Macedonia, as well as in Albania and Kosovo, because of the way the Albanian community is portrayed.

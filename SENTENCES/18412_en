BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (December 11th) to reduce the EU-led military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, by more than 50% in early 2007.
A final decision would be made sometime in February.
If the reductions proceed as planned, EUFOR will shrink to 2,500 troops from the current 6,000 by May 2007.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The shaky coalition governing Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus resigned on Wednesday (20 October) after months of internal confusion following the failure of a UN-sponsored plan to reunite the divided island.
Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat submitted his resignation to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, local officials said.
Talat, who is extremely popular because of his efforts towards reunification, is expected to remain in his post until a new government can be formed.

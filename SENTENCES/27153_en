BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc told EU ambassadors Thursday (October 1st) that he has decided to form a minority cabinet, where the portfolios held by the Social Democratic Party (PSD) will be distributed to Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) ministers.
The government collapsed earlier in the day after ruling coalition partner SDP left, to protest the sacking of Interior Minister Dan Nica.
Under the constitution, Boc has the right to name acting ministers for 45 days, without having to receive a vote of confidence from parliament.
Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu, an independent, takes the foreign affairs portfolio;
Economy Minister Adriean Videanu will look after the health ministry;
Tourism Minister Elena Udrea will be responsible for the environment;
Transport Minister Radu Berceanu will cover the agriculture portfolio;
Finance Minister Gheorghe Pogea will take on the labour ministry;
Telecommunication Minister Gabriel Sandu will handle the SMEs portfolio;
Youth and Sport Minister Sorina Placinta will take on the portfolio for relations with the legislature;
while Boc himself will assume the acting education minister post.
The controversial interior minister portfolio is in the hands of Regional Development Minister Vasile Blaga.
President Traian Basescu has already signed a decree for the new cabinet.

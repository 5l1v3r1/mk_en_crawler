BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic insisted on Wednesday (March 18th) that Serbia would receive a positive assessment from the EU Council of Ministers and would join the countries on the so-called White Schengen List before the end of the year. 
Noting that the technical part of visa facilitation talks was complete, he said the European Commission would present its report to the EU Council in April. 
The report will acknowledge Serbia's considerable progress in all areas, said Djelic, citing unnamed sources. 
Earlier this week, EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels concluded that countries in the Western Balkans had not made enough progress to justify visa liberalisation.

KOSOVO, Pristina Belgrade -- EU security chief Javier Solana said on Sunday (December 9th) that he did not expect violence in Kosovo after Monday's deadline for talks on the province's future status. 
Meanwhile, Serbia's President Boris Tadic said on Saturday that if independence is declared by Kosovo, Serbia has prepared a series of diplomatic and legal measures that could be applied as strong arguments against those who would accept such a declaration.
Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci, whose party won the November 17th elections in the province, told the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that Kosovo has been ready to declare independence since 1989. 
Thaci reiterated that if the UN Security Council fails to reach a decision on the province's future status, he will continue to work closely with the international allies to achieve the province's independence.
Meanwhile, armed clashes broke out on Friday between KFOR peacekeepers and Serbs in the small town of Gorazdevac. 
The incident started with a fight between a local Serb and a French KFOR member and later expanded into a broader conflict that left a number injured. 
According to eyewitnesses, the Serbs threw stones at KFOR's vehicles and shouted "here is Serbia".

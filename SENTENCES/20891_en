ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Nationalist Movement Party agreed on Thursday (October 4th) on a solution to circumvent a possible legal crisis regarding the October 21st referendum on constitutional reforms.
One of the articles in the reform package reportedly says "the people shall vote on the 11th president", but he has already been elected.
The AKP said it would amend the article Friday and submit it immediately to parliament for approval.
In other news Thursday, Turkey's court of appeals upheld the nearly 19-year prison sentence given to a 16-year-old who killed a Catholic priest in February 2006.
The killing occurred at a time of widespread anger in the Islamic world over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad by some European newspapers.

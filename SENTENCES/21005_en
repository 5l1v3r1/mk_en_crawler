ANKARA, Turkey -- The army says ten Kurdish separatists were killed during clashes in the eastern province of Bingol on Sunday (February 3rd). 
The fighters, members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), were killed during a three-day operation in heavy snow. 
No casualties were reported among the military.
In other news Sunday, Turkish authorities confirmed an outbreak of bird flu among chickens in a small village near the northern town of Samsun, on the Black Sea coast. 
Still unclear is whether the dangerous H5N1 strain is involved. 
A quarantine has been imposed and a few dozen chickens were culled to prevent the virus from spreading.

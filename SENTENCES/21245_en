BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic has no intention of surrendering to The Hague war crimes tribunal, the Bosnian Serb newspaper Glas Srpske reported on Saturday (August 30th) quoting an unnamed Serbian police source.
For the past 20 days, Belgrade authorities and Mladic have been negotiating his surrender to the tribunal through a mediator, the newspaper reported.
"He received big offers, particularly for his family.
Ratko Mladic rejected the possibility of voluntarily surrendering to The Hague and responded by saying 'come and arrest me'", the source said.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia City Prosecution has opened a preliminary probe into an alleged classified information leak involving former Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and his deputy, Katya Todorova.
Prosecutors announced on Tuesday (15 November) that the probe involves a controversial deal for a satellite centre connecting the foreign ministry with Bulgarian embassies abroad.
The deal was concluded with a Bulgarian firm, Transat, which used equipment made by the Israeli company, Gilat.
At issue is whether confidential state information was leaked from January 2004 to April 2005.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The Greek Cypriot government on Monday (November 10th) admitted there are certain difficulties in the process of negotiating with Turkish Cypriots to reunify the divided island. 
President Demetris Christofias acknowledged as much at Monday's meeting of the National Council of Cyprus. 
Much effort, determination and flexibility will be needed to complete the process, government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou told reporters after the meeting. 
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are holding their seventh round of talks Tuesday regarding administration, power sharing and legislation.

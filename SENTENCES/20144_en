THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The trial against former Milosevic-era state security chief Jovica Stanisic and his deputy, Franko Simatovic, begins on Monday (March 17th) at The Hague.
The two are accused of murder, forced deportation and inhuman acts.
They allegedly organised and ran secret militia units which became notorious for their violent campaigns against non-Serb populations during the 1991-1995 conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
Both Stanisic and Simatovic have pleaded not guilty, but would face a maximum of life sentences if convicted.

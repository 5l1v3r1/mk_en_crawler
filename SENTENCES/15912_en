SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Presidency postponed on Tuesday (18 April) a decision on supplementing the package of draft constitutional changes until the matter is clarified among the main political parties.
Presidency Croat member Ivo Miro Jovic said party leaders would be summoned again to give their opinions on the need for further adjustments.
At issue are concerns that some of the texts are open to interpretation and could complicate the process of constitutional reform.

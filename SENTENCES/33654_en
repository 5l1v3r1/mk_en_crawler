BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Following talks with senior EU and NATO officials in Brussels on Tuesday (9 September), UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri said that he received full support for his efforts to stabilise the situation in Kosovo.
Holkeri said he was returning to Pristina encouraged by the knowledge that the international community shares the same view regarding Kosovo's security and the need for all ethnic groups to live in peace.
Meanwhile, European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten travels to Pristina Wednesday before heading on to Belgrade.
He will reiterate EU support for endeavours aimed at greater stability.

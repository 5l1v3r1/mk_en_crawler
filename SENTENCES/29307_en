BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic on Tuesday (August 3rd) met with representatives of associations of the families of people killed or missing in Croatia.
The meeting was held on the eve of the 15th anniversary of Operation Storm.
Tadic said that this crime must not be forgotten but, he said, Serbia and Croatia should turn to the future and try to resolve problems of returnees.
The Croatian military offensive, which began on August 4th 1995, ended with the elimination of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina and marked the end of the 1991-1995 conflict in Croatia.
An estimated 200,000 Serb civilians living in Croatia fled to Serbia.

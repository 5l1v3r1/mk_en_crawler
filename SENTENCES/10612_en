NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told parliament in Nicosia on Saturday (13 November) that Turkey must recognise Cyprus if it wants to avoid difficulties in its EU accession bid.
He also said, however, that Athens continues to support Ankara's membership bid.
"We have made it clear ...
that we support our neighbour's European orientation because we believe that a European Turkey can operate to the benefit of all," the prime minister said.
Also on Saturday, three illegal immigrants were killed when they entered an old minefield on the border between Greece and Turkey.
Forty people have been killed and 30 injured in the minefields since 1996.
Meanwhile, Turkish police arrested 148 illegal immigrants, mostly Pakistanis, as they were about to leave in a boat for Greece.
Seven Turkish crewmembers were also detained.
In other news, Greek Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis announced Friday that the Athens Olympics cost the Greek government at least 8.94 billion euros.
The figure represented a "huge overrun" but would not place a burden on the government because the money was spread out over several previous budgets, Alogoskoufis said.

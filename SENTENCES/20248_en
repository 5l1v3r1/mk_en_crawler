PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament unanimously ratified the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU on Tuesday (November 13th), nearly a month after it was signed in Luxembourg. 
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic said that by ratifying the SAA, Montenegro has established itself as a constructive partner in the region. 
The SAA establishes the institutional basis for strengthening political dialogue and the harmonisation of Montenegro's legislation with that of the EU. 
It must be ratified by the parliaments of all 27 EU members before it can be enforced, a process that usually takes two to four years.

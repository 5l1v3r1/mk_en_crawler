BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and EU security chief Javier Solana met on Wednesday (21 January), saying the organisations are holding early talks on replacing SFOR personnel with an EU force of 6,000 troops. 
Both leaders stressed that the EU and NATO would make a joint decision after all military planning issues are resolved. 
Scheffer explained that due to the complexity of the problems, a handover of the mission might occur near the end of the year. 
According to the two officials, NATO's "residual role" in Bosnia and Herzegovina must still be addressed.
In other news Wednesday, an SFOR spokesman in Banja Luka said camps in several locations would be closed down in the coming months, though small SFOR teams would remain in certain areas.

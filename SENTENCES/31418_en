BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers gave final approval to the Union's future mission in Macedonia on Monday (27 January).
The new rapid reaction force will take over NATO's observer mission, which has been in place since 2001.
Though the ministers did not set an exact timetable, it is widely expected that 450 troops will arrive in Macedonia sometime in March.
The initial mandate would be six months.
In Skopje Monday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ilinka Mitreva and Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska discussed implementation of the Ohrid peace accord with members of a European Parliament delegation, led by Doris Pack.
The cabinet postponed its scheduled approval of an action plan for Ohrid implementation, allowing more time for study.
The action plan covers equal representation of all ethnic communities in public administration.

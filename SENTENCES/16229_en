BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney visited the Kozara barracks in Banja Luka on Thursday (14 September) and said the BiH armed forces meet all technical requirements for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
The only hitch, he said, is the country's failure to fulfil its commitments to the war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
Also Thursday, McElhaney said the United States would pull its 150 soldiers out of BiH by the end of the year.
They are serving with the small NATO mission that is working to hunt down fugitive war crimes indictees and train local forces.

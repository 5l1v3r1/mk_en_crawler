SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The outgoing British Ambassador to BiH, Ian Cliff, told local media Sunday (20 March) that achieving and preserving stability in BiH is of the utmost importance for the country. 
According to Cliff, the domestic political situation remains complicated, and the state government must do its utmost to prevent political crises. 
The diplomat's four-year mandate in BiH is set to expire next week.
On Saturday, the BiH ruling coalition partners -- the Party of Democratic Action, the Croat Democratic Union, the Serb Democratic Party and the Party of Democratic Progress -- met to discuss the situation following the court indictments of the BiH presidency's Croat member Dragan Covic and the Constitutional Court's president, Mate Tadic. 
The group pledged to make a joint effort to avert any problems with the functioning of the executive power and to press ahead with the implementation of reforms.

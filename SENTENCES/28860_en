WASHINGTON, United States -- The arrest of war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic "remains a very high priority" for the US, Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian affairs Philip Gordon said on Friday (October 8th).
He said US authorities are working with Belgrade to detain the Bosnian Serb fugitive, and expressed confidence that "Serbia is making a serious effort to find him".
Gordon was speaking to reporters ahead of a planned visit of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Balkans.
This week, Clinton will travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Brussels.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Voters headed for the polls Sunday (13 March) for Macedonia's first local elections since the adoption of new decentralisation legislation.
The vote is seen as the closing chapter in the implementation of the 2001 Ohrid Accords, which granted equal rights to the ethnic Albanian minority.
It is perceived as a crucial test of Macedonia's readiness to move closer to EU membership.
Voters are choosing mayors and councillors in 85 municipalities.
In all, some 5,600 observers -- both international and domestic -- are monitoring the vote.
The first exit polls are expected late Sunday.

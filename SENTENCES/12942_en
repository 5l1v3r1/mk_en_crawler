TIRANA, Albania -- Europe Week in Albania was officially launched Friday (29 April) by the head of the European Commission delegation to Tirana, Lutz Salzman, and European Integration Minister Ermelinda Meksi. 
The weeklong programme includes cultural, social and political events related to the history of the EU and its relations with Albania, as well as recent developments in the Union concerning the region, and Albania in particular. 
Salzman said the celebration shows that the road to the EU is not just one of tough political talks, but also involves sharing values through such activities.
Also Friday, Education Minister Luan Memushi issued a ban on activities by religious sects at schools. 
Members of the clergy will no longer be allowed on school premises, following an increase in the number of suicides among school-age children. 
It is suspected the suicides were influenced by religious sermons. 
The ministry also decided to introduce psychological counselling for teenagers.

ATHENS, Greece -- A 24-hour strike by labour unions representing an estimated 2.5 million workers crippled public transportation across Greece on Wednesday (December 12th).
A total of nine trains were allowed to travel and airspace was closed when air traffic controllers joined the walkout.
The Athens subway and buses ran for about five hours during the day, carrying thousands of trade union members to the centre of the city for a huge rally.
Schools, public offices and banks did not open and OPT, the national telecommunications company, closed for the day.
Lawyers and court officials staged a separate two-day walkout which closed down the justice system.
Ferries stopped running between dozens of islands.
The strikes were called to protest the government's plans to overhaul the pension system.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Athens and other major cities to denounce the proposal.
The strike was described as the largest in ten years.

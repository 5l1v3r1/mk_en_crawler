ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Parliament's committee on foreign affairs will vote on a draft report on Turkey on Monday (April 21st).
A final vote by the general assembly of the parliament is scheduled for May.
The report is expected to mention concerns over the closure case filed against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
One of 250 amendments to the report before the committee vote says that "The European Parliament is gravely concerned about the implications of a possible ban of the governing Justice and Development Party" and that "it expects the Turkish Constitutional Court to act in accordance with the Venice Commission guidelines on the prohibition of political parties." This echoes concerns raised by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly last week.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen on Thursday (March 3rd) hailed Montenegro's commitment to meet criteria for NATO membership.
After talks with Montenegrin Prime Minister Igor Luksic in Brussels, he declined to speculate on the possible timing of the country's admission but encouraged authorities to focus on the Membership Action Plan (MAP).
The country was invited to join NATO's MAP in December 2009.
Rasmussen also thanked Montenegro for its contribution to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.
Luksic, making his first visit to Brussels as prime minister, stressed that membership in NATO and the EU remain top priorities.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Defence Minister Miroslav Nikolic rejected allegations on Friday (4 April) that companies of the federation exported arms to countries under UN embargo. 
He said the defence ministry had carried out a series of checks but found no evidence of such activities. 
High Representative Paddy Ashdown had said there were indications certain companies breached the embargo. 
Nikolic said he had information on BiH companies that sold arms to the Belgrade-based Jugoimport, but was not aware of the final destination.
Also Friday, the People's Assembly of Republika Srpska (RS) rejected allegations that RS political parties were involved in the Orao arms scandal. 
The illegal sale of weapons to Iraq forced BiH Presidency Chairman Mirko Sarovic to resign last week.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Albanian Foreign Minister Ilir Meta and the chief UN officer in Kosovo, Michael Steiner, agreed Wednesday (18 December) to start talks on establishing a free trade zone early next year.
They agreed to strengthen co-operation in fighting organised crime, corruption and mutual energy problems.
Meta also called for the return of refugees to Kosovo.
He and Albanian President Alfred Moisiu met with Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi.
In separate news, Rugova escaped uninjured when his car slammed into another vehicle outside Pristina.
The accident was attributed to foul weather and a slippery road.

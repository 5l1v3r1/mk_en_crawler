Many children in Serbia who come to Belgrade for cancer treatment are faced with long therapy periods. 
During this time, parents and families face the dilemma of where to stay, as renting an apartment in Belgrade can be beyond their means.
A second Parents' House opened last month to help alleviate these problems. 
The house, which once belonged to drug lord Darko Saric, has been transformed into a sanctuary to serve the parents and the social, emotional and medical needs of children with cancer.

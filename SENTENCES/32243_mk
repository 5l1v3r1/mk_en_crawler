ZAGREB, Croatia -- The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague will take into account claims by Zagreb about the health of indicted Gen Janko Bobetko. 
In an interview released Monday (7 October), chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said that the judges would order a medical exam of the 83-year-old retired general, who has been charged in connection with a 1993 offensive that killed dozens of Serbs. 
Del Ponte stressed, however, that Bobetko must first come to The Hague court to enter a plea. 
If doctors determine there are health problems, the court will not order detention, she said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- As expected, Croatia opened EU accession talks Friday (February 19th) on the fisheries and environment chapters at an intergovernmental conference in Brussels.
Croatia's chief EU negotiator, Vladimir Drobnjak, commented that the openings prove that the country is well on its way to completing negotiations, adding that he expects all chapters to be opened by the time Spain's presidency of the EU ends in late June.
In other news, Kosovo opened its embassy in Zagreb on Friday.
Croatia recognised Kosovo's independence in March 2008 and established diplomatic relations with Pristina that June.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Macedonia has made progress, but should continue vigorous reforms, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Wednesday (January 23rd) after a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Brussels. 
Establishing better relations between the ruling and opposition political parties is of particular importance, de Hoop Scheffer noted. 
Gruevski said Macedonia's admission to NATO largely depends on the outcome of its longstanding name dispute with Greece.
Gruevski also met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who said that Macedonia will be given a date to launch EU accession talks after demonstrating progress in a number of "problematic areas". 
These include the judiciary, police, state administration and rule of law, as described in the European Commission's reports on Macedonia's progress, Rehn said.

TIRANA, Albania -- Bamir Topi, deputy chairman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), commented on Thursday (April 19th) that the ruling coalition does not function properly and that DP must bear responsibility for that. 
He was responding to word that the second largest coalition ally, the Republican Party, would announce its own candidate for president, while the third coalition member, the Party of Human Rights, refuses to support the new business regulation law in Parliament. 
Topi insisted the three parties should sit together and resolve their differences so the government can proceed with reforms.
Also Thursday, President Alfred Moisiu warned that he might intervene regarding a bill on fines for businesses. 
Moisiu said Parliament should pass laws that solve problems, not create them.

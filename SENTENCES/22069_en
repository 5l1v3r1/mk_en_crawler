TIRANA, Albania -- Main opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama on Sunday (October 19th) again demanded that Prime Minister Sali Berisha resign. 
He insisted there are many reasons, including Berisha's alleged involvement in controversial infrastructure projects, the March ammunition blasts in Gerdec that killed 26 people and the suspicious death of businessman Kosta Trebicka, a key witness in an investigation of illegal ammunition trading.

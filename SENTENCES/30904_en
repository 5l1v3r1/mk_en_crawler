BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government approved an emergency ordinance Wednesday (December 8th) reducing paid maternity leave from two years to one. 
Right now, mothers receive between 142 euros and 810 euros in maternity benefits a month. 
Prime Minister Emil Boc says there are 200,000 women receiving these benefits across Romania, and the decision to slash the timeframe in half is a cost-cutting effort. 
Under the ordinance, mothers who want to spend another year home with their child can take unpaid leave, which would allow them to keep their job. 
Those who opt to return to work will get an additional 120 euros a month, compared to 10 euros currently. 
The measure is expected to become effective next month.

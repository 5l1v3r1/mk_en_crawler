SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Customs officials prevented a contingent of Greek peacekeeping troops from crossing Macedonian territory on their way to Kosovo because they lacked the necessary documents, Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Vasil Andonovski announced on Wednesday (June 4th).
The officials halted a convoy of 50 vehicles with 140 soldiers at the border Tuesday and forced it to return to the base in Polikastro after consultations with the Greek Foreign Ministry and KFOR.
According to Macedonian authorities, the troops did not carry passports, instead showing their NATO paperwork and identification documents.
Andonovski attributed the action taken to a Status of Forces Agreement.
But Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman George Koumoutsakos said the Macedonians violated procedures observed for the past eight years.

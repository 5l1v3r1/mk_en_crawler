ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday (13 May) advised against politicising the European Court of Human Rights' ruling on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
The court decided on Thursday that Ocalan did not receive a fair trial in Turkey six years ago.
He was convicted of terrorism and the deaths of 30,000 people stemming from his group's separatist revolt.
Erdogan argued that the ruling targeted procedural issues only, not the conviction.
It is still unclear whether Turkey will conduct a retrial.

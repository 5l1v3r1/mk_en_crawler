LUXEMBOURG -- Croatia is working to meet the criteria needed to open all remaining chapters in negotiations with the EU by the end of June, Minister of Foreign Affairs and EU Integration Gordan Jandrokovic said on Monday (April 28th).
He was attending the fourth meeting of the EU-Croatia Stabilisation and Association Council in Luxembourg.
So far, Croatia has opened talks on 18 chapters and provisionally closed two.
Vincent Degert, head of the EC delegation to Croatia, didn't rule out this plan but said Croatia should focus both on opening chapters and closing them.

AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands -- Though they did not identify him by name, Dutch police announced on Tuesday (September 25th) the arrest of a man wanted for war crimes by Serbia. 
He was described only as a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, suspected of committing war crimes in Kosovo. 
A Dutch court will decide whether to allow his extradition to Serbia.
In other news Tuesday, Republika Srpska's Interior Ministry said it has proof that fugitive Stojan Zupljanin visited Serbia and Russia late last year. 
Zupljanin is one of four indictees sought by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

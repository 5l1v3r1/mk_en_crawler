ZAGREB, Croatia -- Visiting Zagreb on Thursday (13 November), European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen said there were no set deadlines for Croatia's entry into the EU. 
Following talks with Prime Minister Ivica Racan, Verheugen said Croatia's membership does not depend on any other countries, adding that it should not be tied to deadlines set for Bulgaria and Romania or for other countries that are less advanced in the process. 
He cited the example of Greece, which was admitted alone in 1981. 
Verheugen added that the 23 November parliamentary elections would be decisive to Croatia's bid to enter the Union, and that the EU is prepared to work with any democratically elected government able to fulfill the country's international obligations, including full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

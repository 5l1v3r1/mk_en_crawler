THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb General Zdravko Tolimir, allegedly a close aide to fugitive Ratko Mladic, refused to enter a plea to genocide charges Monday (June 4th) at The Hague-based UN war crimes tribunal.
Tolimir told the judge that his arrest and extradition to The Hague were illegal, since no lawyer was present when he was transferred from Serbia to Bosnia and Herzegovina territory.
Serbia insists he was actually apprehended in Republika Srpska.
Tolimir also indicated that he wishes to represent himself in proceedings before the tribunal.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic has accused Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the army, and the Orthodox Church of protecting Ratko Mladic and other alleged war criminals. 
In an interview published Monday (22 August), Batic said indictees who surrendered to the UN tribunal had received up to 500,000 euros each from four Serbian tycoons. 
He said the government in Belgrade then provided compensation to the businessmen in the form of lucrative contracts.
In other news Monday, current Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic visited the UN tribunal in The Hague and said nothing blocks the extradition of Milan Lukic from Argentina to the tribunal. 
Although Serbia also demanded Lukic's transfer to Belgrade, Stojkovic noted that tribunal jurisdiction supersedes that of Serbia's judiciary. 
Lukic, charged with the murder of as many as 150 non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict, was arrested in Argentina earlier this month on an international arrest warrant.

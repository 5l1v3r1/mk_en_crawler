PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Lawmakers on Tuesday (October 21st) rejected a demand by opposition parties to add a proposal to parliament's agenda for a referendum on the government's decision to recognise Kosovo. 
Parliament Speaker Ranko Krivokapic said lawmakers rejected the proposal for "procedural reasons". 
The motion set December 14th as a date for the referendum. 
The opposition wanted the public to answer "Do you think that the government should overturn its decision to recognise Kosovo's independence?" Supporting the proposal were the Serb List, the Movement for Change, the Socialist People's Party, the National Party and the Democratic Serb Party. 
Earlier, the opposition warned that if the ruling coalition refused to include the referendum motion on the agenda or vote against it after debate, it would call for early elections.

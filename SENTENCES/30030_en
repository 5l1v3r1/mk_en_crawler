ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities announced on Thursday (February 24th) they have filed attempted homicide charges against a person who carried a longbow and an axe at an anti-government demonstration in Athens on Wednesday, which resulted in clashes with the police.
Eight other people at the rally, which reportedly attracted about 30,000 participants, face lesser charges.
Fifteen police officers were injured in the clashes.
In other news, the United States announced on Thursday it has added the Greek extremist group Sect of Revolutionaries to its black list of terrorist organisations, which bans US citizens from any contact with the group.
The Sect emerged after riots in 2008, which broke out after a police officer killed a teenager.

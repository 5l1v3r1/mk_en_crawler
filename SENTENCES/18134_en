TIRANA, Albania -- Local journalist associations and media are criticising the government sanction against the independent Top-Channel, one of the largest TV stations in Albania, which was fined 12m euros for tax evasion last week.
The media said the measure is an attempt by the ruling Democratic Party to restrict freedom of speech.
Journalists from Top-Channel plan protests in front of the prime minister's office on Monday (July 16th), while the main Albanian TV stations will go black for 15 minutes in a show of support.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The outgoing Croatian government has reiterated that it has no information about the whereabouts of fugitive General Ante Gotovina, who is being sought by the UN war crimes tribunal.
In a statement released Wednesday (26 November), the government denied media allegations that Gotovina was hiding in the Drnis area in Croatia, calling them outdated.
According to the statement, authorities investigated the claim two months ago at the request of UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, but it proved to be false.

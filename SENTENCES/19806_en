ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's National Security Council (MGK) vowed Tuesday (August 21st) that it will continue combatting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and its supporters. 
At its regular meeting Tuesday, led by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the council reviewed domestic and foreign policy issues and measures against any threat to stability.
The situation in Iraq was discussed as a separate topic, with establishing control along its borders described as a priority. 
Agreements signed during Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki's visit to Ankara earlier this month were also discussed. 
This was the last MGK session chaired by Sezer. 
He will leave office as soon as his successor is elected.

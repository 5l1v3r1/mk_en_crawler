WASHINGTON, United States -- The US Treasury Department on Monday (7 July) froze the assets of three citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), accused of helping war crimes suspects evade justice.
The citizens were identified as Dragan Spasojevic, Dragomir Vasic and Milenko Vracar.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, High Representative Paddy Ashdown issued orders freezing the bank accounts of 14 people on the same grounds.
He also stripped Vasic of his post in the Republika Srpska Parliament, along with a second member, Djojo Arsenovic.
The EU has published a list of individuals who are not eligible for visas because of links to war crimes suspects.
In other news, Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Zeljko Mejakic appeared before the UN tribunal on Monday, pleading not guilty to five counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
He is accused of running the Omarska prison camp in BiH in 1992.

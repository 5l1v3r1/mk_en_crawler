ZAGREB, Croatia -- Serbian and Russian intelligence agencies have located top war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, the Zagreb daily Vecernji list reports, citing a high-ranking intelligence source.
The same unidentified source says that the movements of the wartime Bosnian Serb military commander were detected after an unsuccessful attempt to leave Serbia for Russia.
According to the information, Mladic remains on Serbian territory and there have been negotiations regarding his surrender to The Hague tribunal.
Separately, Serbian presidential adviser Jovan Simic told the Belgrade daily Blic that Mladic has been reported to be suffering from health problems and may be seeking medical treatment.
Simic insisted, however, that no one in the Serbian leadership knows of the indictee's whereabouts.

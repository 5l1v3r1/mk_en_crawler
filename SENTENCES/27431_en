BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is sharply raising the reward for information leading to the capture of wartime fugitive Ratko Mladic, making it 10m euros, up from the previous 1m euros, cabinet spokesman Milivoje Mihajlovic announced on Thursday (October 28th).
Deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric said that the move represents Serbia's clear political determination to hand over the Bosnian Serb wartime commander to The Hague tribunal, the last obstacle to its EU integration bid.
The government also quadrupled, to 1m euros, the reward for information about the other fugitive sought by The Hague, Goran Hadzic.

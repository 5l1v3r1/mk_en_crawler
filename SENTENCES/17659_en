BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU, NATO and the United States issued separate statements on Monday (March 26th), backing UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for resolving the Kosovo status issue.
US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said Washington hopes the Security Council would be able to adopt a resolution on Kosovo in April or May.
The German Presidency of the EU issued a statement saying the Union "strongly supports" Ahtisaari's proposed solution.
Following a meeting of the EU Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council on Monday in Brussels, EU security chief Javier Solana and NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also backed the UN roadmap.
They reiterated that Kosovo's status is a particular case and would not lead to consequences in other parts of the world.

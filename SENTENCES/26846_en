PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The country has issued an arrest warrant via Interpol for five people who allegedly deported 79 Bosnian Muslim and Serb refugees from Montenegro in May 1992.
Judge Milenka Zizic said on Thursday (August 6th) the suspects, including former State Security Service head Bosko Bojovic, are charged with war crimes against civilians.
Montenegrin authorities say the suspects are in Serbia and that some have Serbian citizenship.
By law, Belgrade cannot extradite citizens unless they are sought by The Hague war crimes tribunal.

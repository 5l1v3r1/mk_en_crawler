TIRANA, Albania -- The energy ministry said Thursday (8 January) that the government expects to sign a loan agreement worth $100m with the IBRD to finance an energy project. 
The accord is to be signed on 20 January and would provide funds for construction of a new thermoelectric plant near the southern city of Vlora, which is scheduled to be completed in 2007. 
The new plant would both boost the country's electricity generation capacity and provide an alternative energy source to hydropower.
Meanwhile, workers in the Albanian rail sector continued their strike for 16th day in a row Thursday. 
They are demanding an end of year bonus and better working conditions.

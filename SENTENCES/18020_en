SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Protests by those with deposits in the former Yugoslavia's Ljubljanska Banka greeted Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa as he arrived for an official visit to Sarajevo on Monday (February 19th). 
The demonstration was organised by an association of BiH citizens, who have claims of around 135m euros frozen in the bank's successor, Nova Ljubljanska Banka. 
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric told a joint news conference that experts from the two countries must determine a way to resolve the issue. 
For his part, Janez voiced his country's readiness to assist BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration process, and reaffirmed the interest of Slovenian investors in BiH.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Following Sunday's (15 May) local elections, exit polls suggest that the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has lost control over the four biggest cities in the country -- Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka and Split. 
No irregularities were registered during the vote, but the State Electoral Commission's preliminary data showed a very low turnout of 28.5 per cent. 
The Puls Agency's exit polls indicated that the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) took the lead in the Croatian capital with 46.97 per cent of the vote, compared to HDZ's 11.9 per cent. 
Thus, SDP would get 27 out of the 51 seats in the city council. 
Analysts say voters punished HDZ for failing to start accession talks with the EU or improve the economy.

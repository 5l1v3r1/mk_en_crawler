TIRANA, Albania -- The US government on Tuesday (4 March) urged Albania to do more to fight drug trafficking, saying the country continued to be "an important factor in the worldwide drug trade".
The US Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs issued a report saying "organised crime groups use Albania as a transit point for drug and other types of smuggling due to the country's strategic location, weak police and judicial systems, and lax border control." The United States has also offered to help form a special anti-narcotics unit.
Meanwhile, interior ministers from nine countries in Southeastern Europe met in Belgrade on Tuesday to discuss measures against organised crime and trafficking in humans.
Top law enforcement officials from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey, Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia attended.

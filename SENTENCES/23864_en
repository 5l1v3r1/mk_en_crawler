ANKARA, Turkey -- One soldier was killed and two others were injured late on Friday (June 19th) in clashes with members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), media reported Saturday, citing military sources. 
Fighting broke out in the eastern province of Tunceli during an army operation to rescue two civilians kidnapped by the PKK earlier in the week. 
Security forces failed to free the hostages, but the operation continues, the army said.
In other news Friday, rescuers recovered the bodies of two people who were reported missing in a helicopter crash in southwestern Turkey. 
A fire-fighting helicopter with five people onboard crashed Thursday between the towns of Mugla and Milas. 
Two Turkish nationals -- a pilot and a member of the forest protection services -- were killed. 
The other three crew members, reportedly Ukrainian nationals, were rescued.

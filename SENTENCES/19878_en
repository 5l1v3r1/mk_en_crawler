SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliament's joint defence and security committee has again rejected two draft police reform measures, effectively thwarting further progress on them.
The panel's action Thursday (March 20th) marked the second time it had failed to recommend passage by the entire parliament.
The drafts would have established a directorate for the co-ordination of police and support agencies, as well as independent and supervisory bodies of police structures.
Following the committee's move, the House of Representatives agreed to resume debate on the legislation on April 3rd, hoping the bills could be amended by then to attract sufficient support.
Police reform is key to signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
Office of the High Representative spokesman Mario Brkic said, "We once again call on BiH political parties to reach agreement on BiH's European path.
That path has no alternative."
Visiting Sarajevo on Thursday, Romanian President Traian Basescu echoed that sentiment, suggesting with that with a little more effort, BiH could sign the SAA and start intensified dialogue with NATO.
In other news Thursday, Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament adopted a series of draft amendments to the RS Constitution that among other things, would revoke capital punishment.
The draft package will be the subject of public debate for 45 days before another vote by parliament.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country marked the sixth anniversary Monday (August 13th) of the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended armed conflict in Macedonia and became a cornerstone of ongoing EU integration efforts. 
The agreement was signed on August 13th, 2001 in Ohrid, when the then coalition agreed to implement numerous reforms guaranteeing more rights for and better status of the Albanian minority. 
The agreement, hammered out amid strong pressure from the international community, was signed by the leaders of the four main parties in Macedonia at that time. 
The armed conflict began on February 17th, 2001 with an attack by an Albanian paramilitary group in the border village of Tanusevci. 
In the course of two weeks, fighting had spilled over into neighbouring regions. 
Clashes ended up lasting seven months, pitting state security forces against paramilitary units of the former National Liberation Army.

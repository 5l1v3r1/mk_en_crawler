SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The doors of the EU remain open to BiH, but the pace of integration depends on the pace of reforms, German President Horst Koehler told members of the tripartite presidency in Sarajevo.
Koehler and his wife made a daylong visit to the country Thursday (July 5th), including a visit with German soldiers in EUFOR.
Dirk Lange, head of the department for Albania and BiH at the EC's Directorate General for Expansion, was also in Sarajevo on Thursday.
He noted that in the past month, BiH has made some progress in co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, but said this alone is not enough to warrant the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

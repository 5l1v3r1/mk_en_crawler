SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Educators' protests continued on Wednesday (October 24th) -- the fifth week of their strike -- as teachers in some areas began to resign over the cabinet's refusal to nearly double their wages. 
The government repeatedly has rejected the demands, saying the hikes would destabilise the economy. 
The teachers also have sent a letter to the ambassadors of EU member countries in Bulgaria asking them to intervene on their behalf.

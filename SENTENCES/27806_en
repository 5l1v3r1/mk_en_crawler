ANKARA, Turkey -- A prosecutor launched a preliminary inquiry Tuesday (August 24th) into allegations that police members who are followers of a major Islamic movement have been fabricating and doctoring evidence in investigations into alleged coup plots. 
The claims came from police chief Hanefi Avci, in a book he wrote that was released last week. 
Avci alleges that followers of Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen -- holding key police and judiciary posts -- have manipulated probes in a series of alleged plots to topple the government. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the book as "unfortunate" in a television interview late Monday, but did not comment on its contents.
In other news Tuesday, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Berlin announced charges against a Turkish man for his membership in a banned leftist group seeking armed struggle against the Turkish government. 
Alaattin A, 36, is suspected of serving as a leading member of the Marxist terror organisation The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party Front between October 2002 and April 2009. 
He was arrested in February.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Some 85 per cent of Croatia's high school teachers went on strike Wednesday (27 November) demanding better pay. 
Union officials complained that teachers make less than $500 per month; they seek a 20 per cent increase that would bring their pay in line with that of other public sector employees. 
About five per cent of the 30,000 elementary school teachers also joined the walkout. 
In all, some 500 people demonstrated in front of government buildings in downtown Zagreb before union leaders went into a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic and Vitomir Begovic, head of the government's panel for social partnership.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament voted on Thursday (18 March) to ratify the country's accession to NATO in April. 
Only four lawmakers in the 240-seat chamber voted against the resolution. 
Addressing the assembly, President Georgi Parvanov said Bulgaria's NATO membership would help to "consolidate the transatlantic relationship and to create an understanding between Europe and the United States". 
Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said joining NATO "will mean stability and greater prosperity in these uncertain times". 
Bulgaria is set to formally become a member of NATO with six other nations at a special ceremony on 2 April.

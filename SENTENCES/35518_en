SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown said senior officials must resign over revelations that major institutions overspent their 2003 budgets.
"In any normal country ...
that level of waste by institutions could not result in anything other than high-level resignations," he said.
The Central Audit Office found that the presidency had spent nearly 1m convertible marks on top of its 5.2m mark budget.
Some of the money was used to buy luxury cars and suits for the presidency members, as well as diplomatic gifts.
"Two thousand convertible marks were spent on a fountain pen -- that is a whole annual pension for one pensioner," Ashdown said.
The auditors found that 25m marks could have been saved if better financial controls had been in place.

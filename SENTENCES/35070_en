SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country is observing three days of national mourning following the death of President Boris Trajkovski.
All nine people aboard his plane were killed Thursday (26 February) when the aging turboprop slammed into a hill 20 km south of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Trajkovski was to attend an international conference.
Recovery crews spotted the wreckage by air Friday, though mines left over from the 1992-1995 war are hampering ground efforts.
Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski will assume the president's duties, in line with the constitution.
Elections that had been scheduled for the fall will likely be advanced to April.
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski will convene a meeting Friday with representatives of all parties to discuss the need for political stability.
Condolences are pouring in from other governments and the international community, praising Trajkovski's courage and leadership.

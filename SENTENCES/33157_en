BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou met his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, in Brussels on Thursday (15 May) and discussed ways the two countries could co-operate to help resolve the conflict in the Middle East.
They also discussed the Cyprus issue and Turkey's EU accession prospects.
Efforts by the two NATO allies to overcome long-standing differences were hampered, however, by an incident that took place this week over the northern Aegean.
AP reports that mock dogfights erupted between Greek and Turkish jets in disputed airspace.
The incident took place during a Greek Air Force exercise.
None of the planes opened fire.
Turkey's military claimed Greek warplanes harassed its jets during manoeuvres in international airspace.
Greece warned that the Turkish military's powerful influence could hurt its chances of eventually joining the EU.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The NATO summit in Istanbul next month is an important opportunity to strengthen the NATO-EU strategic partnership and bring Turkey closer to the EU, Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said Sunday (9 May). 
Issues such as the global fight against terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, formation of new trans-Mediterranean partnerships and closer co-operation with countries in the Middle East are all going to help bolster that partnership, he said.
In a related development Sunday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that with recently adopted constitutional changes, Turkey has met all political criteria required to launch EU accession negotiations. 
French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that Turkey's EU membership is "desirable" and will happen.

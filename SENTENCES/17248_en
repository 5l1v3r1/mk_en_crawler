BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Interior Ministry announced on Tuesday (May 29th) that police arrested seven people suspected of committing war crimes in the Croatian locality of Lovas, near Vukovar.
The detainees, former Serb volunteers or members of paramilitary formations, are charged with the 1991 torture and killings of a number of Croatian civilians.
No other details have been released.
Regional media reports suggest war crimes prosecutors launched an investigation two years ago, working with Croatian authorities.

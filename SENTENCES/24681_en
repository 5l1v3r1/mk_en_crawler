PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX is looking for a quick re-establishment of control at two border crossings with Serbia in northern Kosovo, local media reported on Monday (June 8th). 
The EU's mission has asked the government to purchase equipment -- including generators -- for its officers as a quick fix, until the crossings are rebuilt. 
They were burned down by Serb extremists protesting Pristina's unilateral declaration of independence in February 2008. 
Since then, there has been no control over goods entering Kosovo from Serbia.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Slovenians are voting in a referendum on Sunday (June 6th) on an agreement on settling their country's border issues with neighbouring Croatia via binding international arbitration.
The deal was signed by Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and his Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor in November 2009 in Stockholm.
It has been ratified by the parliaments of the two countries, but Slovenia decided to hold a referendum to let its citizens have a final say in the issue.
About 1.7 million Slovenians are eligible to vote, and turnout is expected to be around 60-65%.

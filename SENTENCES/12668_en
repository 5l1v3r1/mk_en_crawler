ANKARA, Turkey -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told Turkish leaders that Washington is fully committed to a unified Iraq.
She wrapped up a two-day visit to Ankara on Sunday (6 February), aimed at reassuring officials concerned about ambitions by some Kurds to create a Kurdish region in Iraq, with Kirkuk as its capital.
She told a local TV channel that Washington would not ignore "any kind of terrorism stemming from Iraq".
Following his meeting with Rice, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said relations between Turkey and the United States are at a "positive and mature point".
Rice met with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul before heading on to Israel late Sunday.

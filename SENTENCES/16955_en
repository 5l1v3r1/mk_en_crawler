SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Voters headed to the polls Wednesday (5 July) to decide closely contested general elections.
Polls suggest that the opposition VMRO-DPMNE could get the highest number of votes, but experts say it could have problems forging a coalition.
The ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, meanwhile, could be hurt by low wages and high unemployment.
The party could, however, retain its coalition with the Democratic Union for Integration, the most popular ethnic Albanian party.
In all, voters will be choosing among 2,700 candidates for the 120-seat parliament.
A low turnout is anticipated, due to the summer holiday season.
The election is seen as an important indicator of how quickly Macedonia will be able to join the EU.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Federation of Trade Unions in Macedonia organised mass protests in Skopje Thursday (1 May), marking International Labour Day.
Several hundred workers joined the rally in front of government buildings, including parliament.
The unions explained that they wanted to send a message to authorities and employers that labour conditions must be improved.
While acknowledging that the country is in very complex economic and political situation, the unions insisted that protecting the health and safety of workers and reducing poverty should be government priorities.

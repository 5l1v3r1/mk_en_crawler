LUXEMBOURG -- The EU foreign ministers decided on Tuesday (June 5th) to lift the threat of sanctions against Greece, in light of compliance with Union rules regarding the size of its budget deficit.
Greece posted a deficit of just 2.6% last year, down from 8% in 2004.
The EU had been watching economic performance closely, following revelations that Greece had provided flawed statistics for the years leading up to the adoption of the euro.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has explicitly dismissed the possibility of early parliamentary elections. 
In an interview published in the weekend edition of Jutarnji list, he described speculation by the opposition regarding an early vote as senseless and insisted that elections would take place at the end of 2007, as scheduled. 
Sanader also said he expects Croatia to join the EU in 2009, provided the new EU Constitution is adopted by then.

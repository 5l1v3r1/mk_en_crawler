PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The international community will not abandon Kosovo and will remain in the province for some time, regardless of the outcome of status talks, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari said Saturday (26 November).
His comment followed a meeting with Montenegrin leaders in Podgorica.
The Finnish diplomat reiterated that he expects direct talks to begin between Belgrade and Pristina in early 2006, adding that the involvement of Kosovo Serbs is of the utmost importance.
Later on Saturday, Ahtisaari left for Tirana, where he held talks with Albanian leaders.
On Sunday, he was due to visit Skopje, Macedonia.
In other news, Serbian authorities on Friday returned to Kosovo the remains of 41 ethnic Albanians killed by Serb forces during the 1999 conflict in the province.
Their bodies were exhumed from a mass grave in Batajnica.

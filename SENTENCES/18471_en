ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament formally abolished on Wednesday (May 9th) the current presidential vote, citing the withdrawal of the only candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul of the ruling Justice and Development Party.
He pulled out after Parliament again failed to elect him -- due to lack of quorum -- in a second round of voting.
Deputy Parliament Speaker Nevzat Pakdil says deputies feel there is no chance of electing a president under the current circumstances and the procedure is suspended.

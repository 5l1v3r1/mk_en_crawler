VIENNA, Austria -- EU diplomats will make one last bid to overcome Austria's insistence that the framework of accession talks with Turkey should include an option for privileged partnership rather than full membership in the bloc. 
If the ambassadors fail to break the deadlock at a meeting Thursday (29 September), the British presidency of the Union will summon the foreign ministers of the member states for an extraordinary session Sunday, just hours before the scheduled start of the negotiations.
The European Parliament was to adopt a non-binding statement late Wednesday that would approve the launch of accession talks with Ankara. 
A draft declaration warns Turkey that failure to open its ports to Cypriot-registered vessels could lead to a suspension of negotiations. 
Turkey refuses to formally recognise Cyprus, a sticking point for at least three EU member countries.

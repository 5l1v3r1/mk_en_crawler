SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US State Department official Janet Bourg met with BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic on Tuesday (18 March) and told him that the United States remains actively engaged in BiH in spite of the Iraq crisis. 
Afterwards, Ivanic said it was in BiH's best interest that Washington continues to participate in international activities aimed at stabilising the country.
In other news, Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic asked the international community Tuesday not to sanction Mirko Sarovic, Mladen Ivanic and Milorad Dodik for the so-called Orao affair. 
Cavic says that although the three held top positions in RS at the time of the affair, they were neither aware of, nor responsible for, the illegal arms trade with Iraq, conducted in violation of the UN embargo. 
Cavic says investigators should look into similar violations that occurred in the Federation of BiH.

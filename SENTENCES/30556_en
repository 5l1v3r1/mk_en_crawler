THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (May 10th) that the trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will continue on May 30th instead of May 23rd, as planned earlier. 
This gives the defendant more time to study stacks of new documents delivered by prosecutors. 
The proceedings were suspended on March 21st. 
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from his role in the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

ATHENS, Greece -- Investigators trying to determine why Helios Airways Flight ZU522 crashed in the Greek mountains are focusing on reports of past technical problems.
All 121 passengers and crew died in the Sunday crash.
On Tuesday (16 August), a former mechanic for the Cyprus-based airline, Kyriakos Pilavakis, said the jet lost cabin pressure during a flight last year.
"It was a flight from Warsaw ...
The indications were that air had escaped from one of the doors -- the right door on the rear," he told Greece's state-run NET television.
Pilavakis, who said he resigned from the airline in January, provided six hours of testimony to Cypriot investigators, who have seized maintenance records and other documents from Helios.
The airline's managing director, Dimitris Pantazis, insists the plane was airworthy.

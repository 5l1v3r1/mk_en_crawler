NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Lawmakers ratified the Lisbon Treaty, the document that streamlines the workings of the enlarged EU, on Thursday (July 3rd).
By a vote of 31 to 17 with one abstention, Cyprus became the 20th EU member state to ratify the treaty.
The ruling Communist Party voted against ratification, arguing European citizens didn't have enough input in the treaty's final preparation.
To take effect on January 1st 2009, it must be ratified by all 27 EU member states.

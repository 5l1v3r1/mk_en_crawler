BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors are investigating the role of journalists in instigating war crimes during the 1991-1995 conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
Specifically, reports that may have triggered combat or atrocities against Croats and Bosniaks in the towns of Vukovar and Zvornik between 1991 and 1992. 
"We found examples of instigation of military activities in the media at that time...Now we have war crimes sentences...and can make a connection," prosecutor's office spokesman Bruno Vekaric said on Monday (June 8th).
In other news Monday, a Bosnian court sentenced Bosnian Serb Lazar Ristic to 12 years in prison for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Ristic was found guilty of the November 1992 murders of two Bosnian Muslims -- a man and a woman -- in the western town of Bihac.

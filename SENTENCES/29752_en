THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (May 24th) it has filed contempt of court charges against Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj for the third time. 
This time, Seselj allegedly refused to remove documents from his website revealing the identity of protected witnesses in the main trial against him. 
He has already been sentenced to 15 months in prison for revealing in one of his books the identities of three protected witnesses, despite a court ban on disseminating such information. 
He also faces separate charges for war crimes committed against non-Serbs in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is prepared to submit its proposed constitutional amendments package to parliament Tuesday (March 30th), despite staunch opposition from other parties. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the changes will be approved, even if it takes a public referendum to do so.
The pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party unveiled its own set of constitutional amendments Monday, a document very different from the AKP's version. 
Analysts outside of each party have said that the most important provision would be to lower the electoral threshold from 10% to 3%, allowing potentially smaller parties to win seats in parliament.

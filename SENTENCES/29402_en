ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Authorities and representatives of about 20 of the biggest oil companies in the world met in Istanbul on Thursday (July 1st) to discuss ways to reduce environmental and health risks posed by the growing tanker traffic through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. 
"In 2009, 51,424 ships, including many tankers, crossed the Bosporus. 
This is four times more than traffic through the Panama Channel and three times more than the Suez Channel," Environment Minister Veysel Eroglu said after the forum. 
"Straits can no longer take the growing traffic of tankers and cargo ships. 
The risks of incidents affecting the environment are obvious," he added. 
Turkish authorities presented alternative land routes to companies such as British Petroleum, Chevron, ExxonMobil, ENI, Shell, Total and Transneft.

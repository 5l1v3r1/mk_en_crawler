ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Loa'i Mohammad Haj Bakr al-Saqa -- a Syrian national suspected of links to al-Qaeda and terror plots in Turkey -- reportedly has told Turkish authorities that he got financing from Taliban leader Mullah Omar for the planned bombing of Israeli cruisers in Turkey last summer.
According to an NTV report on Tuesday (21 February), al-Saqa confessed during a police interrogation that he received $50,000 for the proposed attack.
Earlier this month, Turkish prosecutors sought life in prison for the Syrian, the main suspect in suicide bombings in Istanbul that killed 58 people in 2003.

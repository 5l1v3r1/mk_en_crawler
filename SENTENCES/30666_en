SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Relatives of those killed in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre announced on Sunday (December 12th) that they have collected over 4,000 signatures in support of a lawsuit against Carla del Ponte, former chief prosecutor of The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
The lawsuit will be filed in January. 
They claim that thousands of personal effects and documents belonging to the Srebrenica victims were destroyed with del Ponte's approval. 
They say they only learned of the move from the media. 
In May 2009, current chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz confirmed that about 1,000 pieces of evidence recovered from mass graves in and around Srebrenica were destroyed.

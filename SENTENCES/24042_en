PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The implementation of former UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari's plan for Kosovo, also known as the Comprehensive Status Proposal, will be completed next February, local media reported on Monday (March 16th).
The International Steering Group -- established a year ago by 15 countries that recognised Kosovo's independence to oversee Ahtisaari's plan -- will review the document two years after its adoption.
Implementation began when International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith received his appointment to serve in Kosovo.
He says the biggest challenge comes this year with the implementation of new laws.
In other news, Pristina is preparing its documents for the lawsuit that Serbia initiated at the International Court of Justice to determine the legality of Kosovo's independence.
Deputy Foreign Minister Vlora Citaku said on Sunday that Pristina had taken all necessary steps to present Kosovo in the best possible light with the help of international partners.
"Kosovo has a mosaic of necessary arguments to defend its declaration of independence," Citaku said.

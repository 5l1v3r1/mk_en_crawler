ATHENS, Greece -- International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on Tuesday (24 February) praised Athens' security arrangements and said everything possible had been done to make the Summer Olympics safe.
"I would like to thank the Greek government for the unprecedented efforts that it has made in regards to security and safety," Rogge told the Association of National Olympic Committees.
Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos reiterated the government's pledge that all Olympic projects would be completed in time for the opening ceremony in August.
In other news, Oscar-winning American actress Angelina Jolie has agreed to join the torchbearers at the Athens Olympics.
She will run one of the last legs of the relay a day before the official opening.
The Olympic organisers also announced Tuesday that a new museum at the foot of the Acropolis would not be finished in time.
Construction was delayed by litigation from local residents.

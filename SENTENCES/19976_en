PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The government decided on Thursday (January 17th) to begin preparing laws stemming from former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence. 
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said the package eventually would be sent to parliament and reviewed in a special session. 
The UN Security Council failed again on Wednesday to reach a common stance regarding the future of the province.

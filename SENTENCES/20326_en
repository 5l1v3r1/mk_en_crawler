SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The fight against terrorism requires multinational co-operation through trans-border operations, Interior Minister Rumen Petkov said on Wednesday (September 12th) at an international conference on security hosted by Sofia.
At the same conference, Nikolay Zlatev, head of the National Security Service, presented a report by the Bulgarian counter-intelligence services that concludes there is no danger of a radicalisation of Islam in Bulgaria.
Attempts to propagate radical ideas among Bulgarian Muslims were made about ten years ago, he noted.
Valentin Petrov, head of the National Police Service, said the crime rate in Bulgaria has been brought down to levels prior to 1990 and that the number of organised crime gangs can now be counted on one hand.

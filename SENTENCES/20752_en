PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- previously staunch opponents -- have agreed to form Kosovo's next coalition cabinet. 
The PDK won the election on November 17th and now controls 37 of 120 seats in the provincial parliament. 
The LDK was second with 25 seats. 
The leaders of the two parties signed the deal on Monday (January 7th). 
"The number one commitment of this government and of all Kosovo citizens is to formalise Kosovo as an independent, democratic state," Prime Minister-designate Thaci said at a signing ceremony. 
His PDK will get the prime minister's post and seven portfolios. 
The LDK will get the presidency and will appoint a deputy prime minister and five ministers. 
Representatives of ethnic minorities will get the remaining three ministerial portfolios. 
Parliament will vote on the new government Wednesday.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- During his visit this week to the United States, Serbian President Boris Tadic is to sign an agreement establishing the legal status of US troops in Serbia.
On Thursday (7 September), he and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will sign a document that protects US military personnel from arrest and prosecution.
US troops were given the right of passage through Serbian territory under the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
All other countries in Southeastern Europe already have signed agreements with Washington on the legal protection of US service members.
In other news, Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic is in Brussels for meetings Monday with senior EU officials.
The focus is implementation of the so-called "Package Plus", a set of measures aimed at enhancing the EU integration process.
Belgrade unveiled it last month in an effort to resume negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The four main opposition parties in Montenegro agreed on Thursday (August 16th) to work out a common platform for changes to the draft constitution.
Meeting in Podgorica, they said the document would be prepared within the next few days.
The opposition's strongest objections to the current draft, approved by the majority in parliament after ten months of discussions, have to do with the official language in the country and the relationship between parliament and the executive branch of government.
The current draft, adopted on July 31st, made Montenegrin the official language.

NEW YORK, United States -- Outgoing UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed deep concern Friday (December 22nd) over the death sentences handed down in the retrial of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor in Libya. 
They were convicted for the second time on charges that they infected more than 400 children with HIV at a Benghazi hospital. 
Annan urged the Libyan judiciary and the international community to continue efforts towards a "humane solution" in the case. 
He reaffirmed the UN's readiness to offer all kind of assistance to address the needs of the infected children.
UNAIDS, the UN programme on HIV/AIDS, earlier this week urged Libya to reconsider the sentences. 
Compelling scientific evidence showing the virus was circulating in Benghazi prior to the health workers' arrival had not been taken into consideration, it said.
In Bulgaria, a series of public relations campaigns has been launched in support of the medics. 
On Saturday (December 23rd), the Arab League called on Tripoli and Sofia not to politicise the case.

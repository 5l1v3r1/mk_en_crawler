BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian authorities confirmed on Saturday (13 May) reports about a new bird flu outbreak registered in the central village of Hurezu, where 50 dead birds tested positive for the H5 virus the previous day. 
Further probes must prove whether it was the deadly H5N1 virus strain. 
According to Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur, the village was quarantined and culling of fowl began on Saturday. 
In late April, the Romanian governmen had said it considered the bird flu problem resolved. 
Some 53 areas in the country were affected by the disease between October 2005 and April 2006.

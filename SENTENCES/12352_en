SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A survey conducted by the US-based International Republican Institute finds that poverty and unemployment are still considered the major problems in Macedonia. 
In results published Tuesday (11 January), 51 per cent of the respondents said they viewed unemployment as the main burden on the population, while 25 per cent pointed to the economy. 
Asked about their expectations for the future, 46 per cent said the country is moving in the wrong direction, while only 18 per cent believe it is the right one.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Lithuania will not restrict access by Bulgarian and Romanian workers to its labour market after the two Balkan countries' EU accession in January, the Lithuanian government said Monday (November 20th).
According to an official statement, Vilnius is convinced that the unlimited right to work anywhere on EU territory is one of the main EU freedoms.
Also Monday, Slovenia suggested that it intends to keep its labour market open to Bulgarians and Romanians.
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said his country is trying to convince those planning restrictions to reconsider.

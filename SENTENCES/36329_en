BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government concluded negotiations Monday (24 May) with the EU on a bilateral trade regime for basic agriculture products, establishing the quotas exempt from payment of customs duties. 
However, domestic producers complained that the agreed quotas for this year were "extraordinarily low" in the cereals export sector, while quotas for exports of Romania's meat sector were very generous.

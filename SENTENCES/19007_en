BOURGAS, Bulgaria -- Four people, two of them passersby, were wounded in an apparent shootout between rival gangs in the Black Sea city of Bourgas on Monday (April 2nd). 
Police say it happened at noon in the city centre, in front of dozens of witnesses. 
According to reports, the bodyguard of notorious underground boss Dimitar Zhelyazkov opened fire at alleged members of another crime group, wounding them and two bystanders. 
All are expected to survive.
The incident happened just as the European Commission is preparing to release its regular report, assessing Bulgaria's progress in the field of justice and public order. 
Sofia has been criticised repeatedly for failing to combat organised crime.

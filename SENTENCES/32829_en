PARIS, France -- On Tuesday (3 December), Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou urged EU members to increase their defence budgets.
Currently, Greece is the only member country that spends more than 5 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence;
others do not spend more than 1 per cent.
Papantoniou added that Greece would treat domestic security and the fight against terrorism as top priorities during its presidency of the Union, which starts on 1 January.

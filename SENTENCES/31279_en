SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- In his New Year address, High Representative Valentin Inzko said that forming a government after the October elections should be the politicians' top priority in 2011.
"Voters went to the polls â¦ because they want to see a government that works.
They want jobs and the country economic and social problems tackled.
People also voted for greater rule of law.
I will support all efforts to put in place a coalition that will deliver this in practice," Inzko said in remarks published on Thursday (December 30th).
A second priority, he said, is progress in EU reforms.
He also stressed that "challenges to the [Dayton] Peace Agreement must end".

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The ruling coalition is so divided over the so-called law on public information that it could trigger early elections, local newspapers reported on Friday (July 31st).
Leaders of the Democratic Party (DS), G17 Plus and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) -- Boris Tadic, Mladan Dinkic and Ivica Dacic -- respectively, met to discuss the law Thursday.
The SPS and its partners from United Serbia and the Pensioners Party oppose the bill, which regulates the activities of the media.
Tadic, Dinkic and Dacic agreed to postpone any vote on the bill until August 31st, allowing time to consult with journalists, media associations and European institutions, which reportedly have concerns with the draft.
Dinkic said that if the information law is not adopted at the end of August, G17 Plus will start making independent decisions on how to vote on any upcoming legislation.
The main opposition parties -- the Serbian Democratic Party, New Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party -- criticised the coalition for postponing the vote by a month and questioned its ability to function.

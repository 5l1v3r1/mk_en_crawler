BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Bundestag will ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between Serbia and the EU on February 10th, Michael Stubgen, head of a German parliamentary delegation, said on Wednesday (February 2nd) during a visit to Serbia.
After talks with Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Bozidar Djelic, he reiterated the Bundestag's support for Serbia's EU bid but noted the country has a long way to go before joining the bloc.
Djelic said Serbia hopes for candidate status at the EU summit in December.

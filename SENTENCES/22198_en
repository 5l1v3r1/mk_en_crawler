BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government is drafting a new law on political parties that would slash the number of parties in the country.
Public Administration and Local Self-Government Minister Milan Markovic said on Tuesday (August 12th) that with the law, about 20 parties would remain in Serbia after two election cycles, compared to the 433 parties currently registered.
In the past five months, 15 new parties have emerged.
The new law would oblige each party to collect 5,000 signatures before gaining official status, which is slightly higher than the current requirement.
Parties representing minorities would need to collect 500 to 1,000 signatures.

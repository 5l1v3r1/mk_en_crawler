PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The province's negotiating team, the Unity Group, decided on Tuesday (July 17th) that parliament will hold a debate on July 30th concerning the delay in resolving Kosovo's status. 
The session will focus on the latest developments and future moves to be undertaken by local institutions. 
After the Unity Group meeting, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said there is little chance now that Kosovo's final status will be resolved via the UN Security Council.
Meanwhile, the Serbian daily Blic quoted Azem Vlasi, an adviser to Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku, as saying Pristina will declare independence if the Security Council does not adopt the Ahtisaari plan after new talks between Pristina and Belgrade.

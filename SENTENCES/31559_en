SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy will discuss the Iraq crisis and ratification of the protocol for Bulgaria's accession to NATO when he meets with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
On Sunday (19 January), Passy flew to New York, where he will participate in a ministerial-level meeting of the UN Security Council. 
He denied reports by the US press that his government has already pledged official support for a military strike against Iraq.
Also on Sunday, Finance Minister Milen Velchev said Bulgaria will not require IMF financing after the end of this year and would instead shift to a new stage, a precautionary agreement with the Fund.

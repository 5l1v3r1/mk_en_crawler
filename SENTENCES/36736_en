SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski urged the public to show restraint Friday (23 July) following Thursday's unrest in Struga. 
Crvenkovski said the riot in front of the regional headquarters of the ruling Social Democratic Union (SDSM) represented neither a democratic nor civil protest but "vandalism". 
Over 20 people, including policemen, were injured in the riot, after unexpected visits by Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and SDSM Secretary General Nikola Kurciev to Struga resulted in a siege at SDSM's headquarters. 
The crowd was protesting the cabinet's bill on territorial division. 
SDSM now intends to sue Struga Mayor Romeo Dereban, who it says was responsible for the unrest.

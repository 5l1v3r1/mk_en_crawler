SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU representative in Macedonia Erwan Fouere said on Sunday (October 31st) that the European Commission's (EC) report on Macedonia, due in November, will praise progress made in the country's EU integration process but will also point to some shortcomings, since more reforms are needed. 
As for the meeting between Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and Macedonian counterpart Nikola Gruevski in Brussels on Friday, Fouere stressed the importance of such meetings because they demonstrate the will for dialogue. 
He voiced hope that a solution to the long-standing name dispute between the two countries will be found soon.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government reportedly disagrees with a proposal by the main opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) for a new strategy in relations with Turkey.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis met with PASOK leader George Papandreou on Wednesday (7 June) to hear the proposal but made no comment afterwards.
PASOK apparently wants Athens to demand its territorial waters in the Aegean Sea be increased before signing any agreement to resolve bilateral disputes with Turkey through international arbitration.

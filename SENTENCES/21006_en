PODGORICA, Montenegro -- In a statement Monday (September 3rd), the South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO), an affiliate of the International Press Institute, expressed concern over the weekend assault on Montenegrin journalist Zeljko Ivanovic, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Vijesti. 
SEEMO urged Montenegrin authorities to thoroughly investigate the case and find the perpetrators. 
Ivanovic was attacked Saturday evening outside a restaurant and beaten with sticks or pipes, resulting in several fractures.
Milo Djukanovic, the country's former president and prime minister, said he may file a lawsuit against Ivanovic, who claims Djukanovic was behind the attack.

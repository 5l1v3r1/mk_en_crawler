THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal Appeals Chamber handed down its first life sentence on Thursday (November 30th) to Bosnian Serb General Stanislav Galic.
Ironically, he was appealing a 20-year sentence handed him by a lower court nearly three years ago.
He was convicted in connection with the shelling of Muslims in Sarajevo from 1992 to1994.
In other news Thursday, during a visit to Sarajevo, UN tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte told High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling that BiH's present level of war crimes co-operation is unsatisfactory.
Del Ponte insisted that BiH -- especially Republika Srpska authorities -- should redouble their efforts to bring remaining fugitives to justice.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Pardew criticised strongly any interference in the privatisation process, during a speech Wednesday (18 December) closing the conference on Bulgaria's membership in the UN Security Council. 
Pardew said that the companies that won the bids for Bulgartabac and BTC did so according to "legitimate, fair and transparent" procedures and that the judiciary's interference taints Bulgaria's image among international investors. 
Pardew also said "parties, courts and prosecutors who are aggressive in finding fault in this privatisation process are the same ones who are failing to be aggressive against organised crime and corruption." Recent court decisions halted the two largest privatisation deals.
In one other financial development, the IMF mission in Sofia reportedly has reached an agreement with the Bulgarian government on the 2003 state budget. 
The two sides will finalise work on the supplementary memorandum Thursday.

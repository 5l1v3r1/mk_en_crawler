PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Iceland has become the first country to officially recognise Montenegro as an independent state.
In a letter, Icelandic Foreign Minister Geir Haarde congratulated Montenegrins on the adoption of their Independence Declaration and added that Iceland is eager to establish formal diplomatic relations with Podgorica.
On a related note, Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic plans to travel to Luxembourg on Monday, to ask the EU to recognise Montenegro.
On Thursday (8 June), the Serbian government adopted several decrees that effectively abolish several institutions made obsolete by the breakup of the federal union with Montenegro.
These include the Serbian-Montenegrin Parliament, the presidency of Serbia-Montenegro, the Council of Ministers, the Supreme Defence Council and the Court of Serbia-Montenegro, as well as the federal human and minority rights ministry.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic criticised the government Monday (28 November) for a draft agreement with Austria regarding the restitution of property belonging to members of the German ethnic community expelled from Croatia after WWII.
Mesic warned that the deal could result in negative consequences for Croatia, as other countries could file similar claims.
He also voiced strong dissatisfaction with the fact the cabinet had not informed him of its plans in advance.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci on Saturday (August 14th) ruled out any possibility of autonomy as a solution for Serb-dominated northern Kosovo. 
"The only document for northern Kosovo is the Ahtisaari Proposal," Thaci said during a visit to northern Mitrovica. 
"[Autonomy] was never discussed or asked for. 
I can tell you that it is just media speculation, because there will be no autonomy for northern Kosovo under any circumstances," he added. 
Thaci also said there are no discussions about a special status or the model of South Tyrol being applied to Mitrovica. 
"We will continue working based on the integration strategy that was presented some time ago by the government of Kosovo and international [organisations]," he said. 
Thaci added that with the help of these organisations, about 90% of the Ahtisaari Plan on supervised independence has been implemented.
But the International Civilian Office (ICO) and EULEX quickly noted there is still work to be done. 
The ICO's last evaluation on June 14th indicated that about 52% of the Package has been fully implemented, most of it related to drafting legislation. 
Based on an 18-page matrix on monitoring the Ahtisaari Package, seven provisions have not been fulfilled at all, 46 have been partially implemented, while 58 others have been fully implemented.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The head of the European Commission's (EC) Delegation to Bulgaria, Dimitris Kourkoulas, said Sunday (5 December) that the EU would soon decide on a date for Bulgaria's signing of the EU Accession Treaty.
Talking to the national TV channel bTV, Kourkoulas stressed that Bulgaria plays a constructive role in the Balkans and would be even a more stabilising factor after its entry in the EU.
Kourkoulas' statement came a day after Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov again expressed concerns that Bulgaria's efforts to seal the Accession Treaty next spring and join the EU in 2007 might be thwarted by delays involving three other candidates -- Romania, Turkey and Croatia.

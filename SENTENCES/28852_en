TIRANA, Albania -- President Bamir Topi supported a request by Muslims to build a big mosque for the city of Tirana on Thursday (September 9th). 
"I would not like to see people praying on the pavements or even in the streets. 
Therefore, I would like to invite everybody to contribute in order for the Muslim community in Tirana to have their mosque," Topi said during a visit with Muslim community leaders to mark the Bayram holiday. 
The Muslim community has been complaining for years about the lack a big mosque where they could gather in larger numbers. 
Tirana already has a big Catholic cathedral, and a Christian Orthodox church is opening soon downtown.

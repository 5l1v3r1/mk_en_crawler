TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament went back to work Monday (September 10th) after the summer recess, a week after committee members returned to their jobs.
In her opening speech, Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli said consensus is crucial to achieve reforms related to EU and NATO integration.
In other news, the main opposition Socialist Part (SP) caucus met on Monday and elected Valentina Leskaj as the new chairman of the SP parliamentary group.
Leskaj's predecessor, Ben Blushi, resigned from the post after six SP lawmakers helped elect Bamir Topi as president during a vote by parliament in July.

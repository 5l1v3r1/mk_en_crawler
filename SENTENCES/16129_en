VIENNA, Austria -- A two-day summit of European leaders, which began on Thursday (15 June), failed to resolve the European Constitution issue, leaving the future of the enlargement process in limbo.
Under a new draft of a proposal by current EU presidency holder Austria, expected to be approved on Friday, the EU will come up with a report in the first half of 2007 as "the basis for future decisions on how to continue the reform process".
The leaders agreed "that the necessary steps to that effect will have been taken during the second semester of 2008 at the latest", but also expressed hope that the process of ratifying the charter could continue and be completed.

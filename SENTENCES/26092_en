ANKARA, Turkey -- A trial in Turkey that lasted over 28 years ended on Tuesday (December 15th) with life sentences given to 39 of the 1,223 defendants charged with trying to topple the government and the constitutional order. 
Charges against the others were dropped. 
All of the defendants were suspected members of the outlawed extreme leftist organisation Revolutionary Left (Dev-Sol). 
They were arrested immediately after the military coup in 1980. 
Thirteen of the defendants have died since the trial began. 
Those who got life sentences will actually not serve their time due to all the years they have spent in custody.

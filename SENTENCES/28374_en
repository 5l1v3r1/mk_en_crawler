PARIS, France -- Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic has requested Interpol's help to locate the two remaining war crimes fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
Dacic met on Tuesday (November 16th) in Lyon with Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble to discuss co-operation in the fight against organised crime.
But Dacic also suggested the international police organisation could help gather information about Mladic and Hadzic's whereabouts, and determine whether they are in Serbia.

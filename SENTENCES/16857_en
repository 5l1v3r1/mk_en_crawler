SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- UN war crimes tribunal President Fausto Pocar has criticised Serbia and Republika Srpska (RS) for their continued failure to co-operate with the tribunal. 
In an interview in Monday's (November 6th) Dnevni avaz, he said authorities in Belgrade and Banja Luka have broken a succession of promises and failed to locate and arrest Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, who he described as the two most-wanted war crimes indictees on the planet.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP), was handed an opportunity to land the post of prime minister when the electoral board announced Monday (2 December) that it had nullified the election of three deputies from the Siirt province.
New elections will be held for the seats within 60 days of the official publication of the board's decision.
AKP Deputy Chairman Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat says that could pave the way for Erdogan to get the post because it would give his party time to amend the constitution.
Under Turkish law, only an elected deputy can become prime minister, and Erdogan is currently banned from holding a seat in parliament due to a 1998 conviction for incitement.
A constitutional amendment could enable Erdogan to run for one of the seats in Siirt, then assume the premiership from his close aide in the AKP, Abdullah Gul.

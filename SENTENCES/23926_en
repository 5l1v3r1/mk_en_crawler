Noting that it was agreement among representatives of the three constituent peoples, Lajcak said it "moves BiH forward from the past year of poisonous atmosphere towards the EU integrations". 
Also signing the Prud agreement was Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
In other news Monday, BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric confirmed Croatian police had arrested Vjekoslav Vukovic, head of the department for fighting organised crime and terrorism, for links to organised crime.

Vukovic has dual Bosnian and Croatian citizenship.

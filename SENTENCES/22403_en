TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) supports a proposed draft law that would limit lawmakers' immunity. 
The current provisions on immunity hamper the fight against high-level corruption, DP deputy leader Astrit Patozi said on Thursday (September 11th). 
The Democrats will seek a compromise on the proposal among political parties, especially with the main opposition Socialist Party, Patozi added.

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Experts from the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's (CoE) advisory body on constitutional matters, have sent Montenegrin authorities 199 recommendations concerning the country's draft constitution. 
At its session on Friday (June 1st), the Venice Commission concluded the draft is generally in line with CoE standards, but needs improvement in the sections relating to minority rights, the election of judges and the composition of the Judicial Council.
In July, a Venice Commission delegation will visit Podgorica to review how its recommendations were incorporated.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov on Friday (21 January) said the country's referendum on EU accession should be held either this autumn or in the spring of 2006, after the signing of the accession treaty -- expected in late April of this year -- and after general elections, which he proposed holding in June. 
Parliamentary Speaker Ognyan Gerdzhikov agreed with most of Parvanov's proposals, but took issue with the proposed timing of the referendum. 
Parvanov's suggested timeline, he said, would likely delay ratification of the accession treaty by EU countries and could even jeopardise Bulgaria's target of entering the EU in 2007.

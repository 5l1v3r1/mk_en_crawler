BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael C. Polt said Wednesday (30 March) that while Serbia has improved its co-operation with The Hague tribunal, financial assistance to the republic would be withheld until all indictees are extradited.
Polt's comment came during a visit to Novi Sad.
In mid-January, the US government froze $10m in aid, citing Serbia's failure to fully meet its obligations to the tribunal.
Also Wednesday, Serbia-Montenegro's government endorsed a draft law, blocking the assets of war crimes fugitives.
The bill was forwarded to the federal union's legislature for urgent approval.

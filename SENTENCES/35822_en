SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Plainclothes members of SFOR on Wednesday (28 January) arrested a man suspected of helping top war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. 
Zeljko Jankovic, known as Luna, was picked in downtown Bijeljina. 
SFOR spokesman Captain Dave Sullivan told reporters that Italian carabinieri also raided the suspect's home looking for information that "may lead to detention of persons indicted of war crimes". 
Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said through a spokeswoman that she was certain Karadzic would be arrested by the end of this year.
In other news, the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague convicted Croatian Serb leader Milan Babic of one count of crimes against humanity. 
The former president and foreign minister of the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina pleaded guilty Tuesday, as part of a deal with prosecutors. 
Sentencing is expected in April.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court announced on Friday (January 26th) that 15 out of the 38 inmates who have been staging a hunger strike at Kula prison have begun taking food again. 
The strike has been on since January 8th. 
The lawyer for one of the prisoners says the inmates only provisionally suspended their action, in order that the BiH judiciary could review their demands "without pressure". 
The inmates, all charged with or convicted of war crimes by BiH, are demanding that their trials be conducted under the more lenient former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia laws, instead of the current BiH laws. 
They argue that those were in place at the time the alleged crimes were committed.

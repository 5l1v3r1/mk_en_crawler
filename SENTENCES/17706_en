ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Ankara decided on Friday (March 23rd) to nearly double the prison terms of four policemen, convicted in connection with the 1991 death of university student Birtan Altunbas. 
A second trial was held after the Turkish Court of Appeals recently overturned the original sentence of 4.5 years as too lenient. 
Altunbas, a final-year student at the Hacettepe University, was apprehended as an alleged member of an outlawed leftist organisation. 
He died in hospital six days later. 
Forensic results found his death resulted from torture.

ATHENS, Greece -- Athens will be paralysed on Tuesday (December 14th) by a 24-hour strike, again by the public transport sector. 
Participants are also rallying in front of the parliament building, where lawmakers are set to vote on a bill that would cut salaries in the public sector. 
Strike organisers say it will continue on Wednesday, when a nationwide strike will be held. 
Railways will grind to a halt for several hours Tuesday, and will join the general strike on Wednesday and Thursday. 
Port workers, bank employees, journalists and doctors are also joining the action Tuesday.

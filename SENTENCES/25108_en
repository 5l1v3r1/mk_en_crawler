SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Construction of the country's second nuclear plant will be suspended for 18 months after the government's strategic partner, RWE, officially announced on Wednesday (October 28th) its withdrawal from the project.
The reason was financing for the project.
Given the global economic crisis, the government hasn't managed to raise necessary funding.
Construction costs are estimated at 4 billion euros, though delays so far may increase that figure by 50%, according to Atomstroyexport, the Russian nuclear engineering firm contracted to build the plant.

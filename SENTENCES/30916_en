SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko will start consultations with the main parties in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) aimed at ending the ongoing political stalemate and facilitating the formation of new cantonal, entity and state-level governments.
It's been five months since elections were held.
Leaders of the Croat party HDZ BiH Dragan Covic, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- Zlatko Lagumdzija, HDZ 1990 -- Bozo Ljubic and Party of Democratic Action (SDA) leader Sulejman Tihic agreed to this initiative after meeting separately with Inzko on Wednesday (March 9th).
At the initial stage, the leaders themselves will not participate;
rather, they will leave negotiations to party functionaries.
In other news Wednesday, delegates in FBiH's House of Representatives elected their chairmanship.
Bosniak Denis Zvizdic of the SDA was elected chairman, while Serb Svetozar Pudaric of the SDP and Croat Stanko Primorac Cane, a nominee of the Croatian Party of Rights of BiH and the Democratic National Union, were appointed as his deputies.
Marinko Cavara, who was nominated by the HDZ, lacked the necessary support for deputy chairman.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A court in Zagreb issued a statement Thursday (28 November) saying that former Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko will not be extradited to The Hague due to health concerns.
A group of seven medical experts concluded that the 83-year-old retired general is unfit to stand trial, the court said.
Bobetko was hospitalised earlier this month and has a history of heart problems and diabetes.
The UN war crimes tribunal has indicted him for his role in the Medak Pocket operation during the 1991-1995 war.
The Croatian government will submit the experts' report to the UN court, which is expected to send its own team to verify Bobetko's condition.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR has completed the process of verifying candidates for the future BiH armed forces' general staff, but a new list would be requested, according to SFOR spokesman Dave Sullivan.
He said Thursday (22 April) that a number of officers failed to pass the vetting process, adding that some names should never have been included.
In other news Thursday, the Federation of BiH (FBiH) government adopted the defence bill.
It stipulates that the FBiH Army is part of the BiH armed forces and is under the control and command of the BiH presidency.

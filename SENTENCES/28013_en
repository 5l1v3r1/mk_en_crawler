PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said on Wednesday (April 21st) that Kosovo institutions are primarily in charge of the rule of law in the young country.
Rather than political intervention in the judiciary, he urged officials to work harder to fight corruption.
Addressing the Joint Co-ordinating Rule of Law Board, de Kermabon said Kosovo authorities "are in the driver's seat in the process".

ANKARA, Turkey -- Tests are under way to determine if the death of an 11-year-old girl Wednesday (18 January) was caused by bird flu.
Sevdi Acar died in the eastern town of Erzurum on her way to the hospital.
She was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, but doctors say her symptoms indicate bird flu.
If confirmed, she would be the fifth bird flu fatality in Turkey.
Also Wednesday, a four-and-a-half-year-old boy was diagnosed with it in Dogubeyazit, near the border with Iran.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Families want institutions to do more to shed light on the fate of 1,837 missing people.
Marking International Day of the Disappeared on Monday (August 30th), government officials said the international community should exert pressure on Belgrade to provide more information about the whereabouts of missing persons.
International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith said every means should be used to address the legal, social and economic uncertainties of families of missing persons.
Feith encouraged Kosovo's parliament to adopt a law on missing persons that would strengthen support for family members and their efforts to rebuild their lives.

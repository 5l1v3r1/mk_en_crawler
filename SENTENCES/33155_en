ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Relations between Turkey and the EU do not focus on problematic points anymore but on fields of co-operation, according to Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, who spoke Monday (16 June) at the 50th meeting of the Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary Commission. 
Gul said the meeting coincides with an important stage in Turkey's EU membership aspirations, as parliament is currently discussing a legislative harmonisation package. 
He added that the government is determined to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria by year's end.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal is visiting Washington this week and says talks regarding $1 billion in US financial aid are about to begin. 
The aid would be tied to reconstruction work in Iraq.

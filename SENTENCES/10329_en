PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN will not block Ramush Haradinaj's candidacy for prime minister of Kosovo despite concerns that he might be indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, UN spokesman Jeff Bieley said Wednesday (24 November).
"We leave this decision in the hands of the political parties and the Kosovo assembly," he added.
Earlier this week, EU security chief Javier Solana questioned the appointment of Haradinaj, a former KLA commander who has been interviewed by the tribunal about atrocities committed in 1998-1999.
In other news, three ethnic Albanians received two-year prison sentences for looting and torching a historic Serb Orthodox Church during the March riots in Kosovo.
International prosecutors have opened 52 cases in connection with the unrest.

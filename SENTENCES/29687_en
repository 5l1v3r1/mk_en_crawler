SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski announced on Wednesday (March 30th) that his senior ruling VMRO-DPMNE party will propose June 5th as a date for early elections. 
The decision came as Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM, said earlier that he was dropping all demands and will participate in the elections. 
His party, however, will continue to boycott parliament. 
Lawmakers must still elect a head of the State Election Commission and approve changes to the electoral code before parliament is dissolved.

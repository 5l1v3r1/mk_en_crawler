PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Council for Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms (CDHRF) denounced on Monday (March 21st) the newly created municipality of Gracanica for violating a law on the use of official languages.
Albanians in this municipality complain that local officials issue documents only in Serbian, using the Cyrillic alphabet.
Albanian residents consider this a provocation, the Council said in a press release.
The CDHRF says it directly violates the law on the use of languages and the law on non-discrimination.

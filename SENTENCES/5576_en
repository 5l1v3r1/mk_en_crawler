The Sarajevo Film Festival's 16th edition, which was held from July 23rd to 31st, faced the looming dark cloud of recession over Europe â€“ a situation which gave organisers added motivation to make the event a success.
"Our aim was to renew BiH cinematography and create an atmosphere for development of young filmmakers who will connect with their European colleagues and the world.
I think that we have fully achieved that and more.
People come here, work and develop their projects.
This is no longer a festival where movies are merely watched, but are also made," festival director Mirsad Purivatra told SETimes.

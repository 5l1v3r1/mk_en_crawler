PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR considers Serb parallel structures in Kosovo dangerous, commander General Marcus Bentler said on Sunday (January 10th), adding that they violate UN Resolution 1244 and are therefore considered illegal. 
"These structures risk stability," Bentler said at the Italian KFOR military barracks in Peja/Pec. 
"We are aware of their existence, but it is up to local and international [officials] to deal with them," he added.

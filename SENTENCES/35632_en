SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov will hold consultations Thursday (8 April) on military, political and technical measures intended to guarantee the safety of the Bulgarian troops in Karbala, following the latest escalation of tensions in Iraq.
During Wednesday's urgent session of the National Security Council, Parvanov said the Bulgarian contingent would remain in Iraq, as the country must fulfil its international obligations.
In other news, Sofia police detained four alleged drug bosses late Wednesday for questioning and later released them.
Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov called it a "routine operation" in the fight against organised crime.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- NATO has strengthened its presence in northern Kosovo, to coincide with the end of direct negotiations on the final status of the province.
KFOR Commander Xavier Bout de Marnhac confirmed on Thursday (November 29th) that 90 US soldiers were deployed at the camp closest to Serbia proper, where 2,800 peacekeepers are routinely positioned.
On Wednesday, Germany announced that it is sending 500 additional troops to Kosovo to prevent possible unrest if Kosovo Albanians declare independence next month.
Britain also expressed readiness to send extra troops.
Separately Thursday, Serbian Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac ruled out military intervention in Kosovo if independence is declared.
He also noted that so far, co-operation between Serbia and KFOR has been excellent.
"International peacekeeping troops are not enemy organisations," he said.

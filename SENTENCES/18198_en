TIRANA, Albania -- Another attempt by Parliament to elect a successor to outgoing President Alfred Moisiu failed on Saturday (July 14th), amid a continuing boycott by the opposition. 
None of the three candidates managed to garner the required 84 votes. 
The two top candidates -- Bamir Topi of the ruling Democratic Party and Neritan Ceka, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance Party -- now face off in another round.

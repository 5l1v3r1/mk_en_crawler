TIRANA, Albania -- Air pollution in Tirana shortens the life of residents by one to two years, local media reported on Saturday (October 24th), citing experts. 
Smog, dust and rubbish burning are the main factors behind pollution, levels of which far exceed acceptable standards. 
The World Health Organisation estimates that about 200 deaths recorded in Albania every year are a result of air pollution.

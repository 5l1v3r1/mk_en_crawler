BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), said on Saturday (December 26th) that the party will undergo a major reform in its policy, programme, and leadership next year.
He added that the country needs political stability, not early elections.
He also said that by forming a coalition with the Democratic Party, the Socialists have done a lot for Serbia and its citizens, resulting in visa liberalisation and applying for EU membership last week.

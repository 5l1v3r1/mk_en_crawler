SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The EU and the United States on Tuesday (December 19th) condemned a Libyan court ruling against five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, who received death sentences for allegedly infecting more than 400 children with HIV at a Benghazi hospital. 
The guilty verdict was returned despite compelling scientific evidence that the disease had spread up to three years before the medics' arrival in Libya, apparently because of poor hygiene at the facility.
In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joined visiting Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin in denouncing the sentences. 
EU spokesman Johannes Laitenberger, meanwhile, said the bloc "simply cannot accept this verdict". 
Top officials from individual EU member states also spoke out against the decision. 
"France deplores this verdict," Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said. 
The Czech Foreign Ministry called the treatment of the Bulgarian defendants "a serious violation of human rights". 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the sentence "terrible".
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev issued a statement urging the Libyan authorities to intervene immediately. 
The defence has 30 days to appeal the sentences.

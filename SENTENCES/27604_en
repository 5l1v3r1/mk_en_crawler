ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police on Saturday (September 25th) arrested a former Croatian military police officer convicted of committing war crimes against Serbian civilians at the Lora prison camp. 
Miljenko Bajic was sentenced in 2004 in absentia to six years in prison. 
He was detained near Omis and transferred to the prison in Split. 
Two more people convicted in the same case remain on the run. 
More than 1,000 civilians and war prisoners, mostly ethnic Serbians, were held at Lora prison during the 1990s wars in the Balkans.

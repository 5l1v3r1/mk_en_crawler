GENEVA, Switzerland -- Greece and Turkey have violated an international treaty banning landmines by failing to destroy their stockpiles, according to a report Friday (November 21st) by the NGO International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).
Under the terms of the Ottawa Convention, which they ratified in 2003, the two countries should have destroyed more than 4 million land mines by March 2008.
The ICBL says Greece blames legal difficulties with a contractor and logistical issues.
Turkey says preparations to destroy its stockpiles took longer than planned.

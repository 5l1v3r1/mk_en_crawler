SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH presidency's Serb member, Borislav Paravac, said Wednesday (18 February) that he has demanded a written explanation from BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic detailing why Branko Stevic's candidacy for the post of state defence minister was rejected.
His comment followed a meeting with Terzic, which Paravac said did not result in a sufficient explanation.
Terzic has cited Stevic's alleged war past.
In other news Wednesday, Terzic welcomed a move by 12 leading BiH parties to sign a joint declaration in support of the country's admission to the EU and NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
The parties pledged to unite efforts towards political consensus and the further democratisation of BiH.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Construction began Wednesday (February 10th) on the new US Embassy in Belgrade, with US Ambassador Mary Warlick, Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning Oliver Dulic and Belgrade Mayor Dragan Djilas at the ground breaking ceremony.
The new building will be located in the Dedinje diplomatic suburb and should be completed by 2012.
The existing embassy was damaged early in 2008, during protests against Kosovo's independence.

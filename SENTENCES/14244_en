LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Monday (13 March) that Ljubljana would not hamper Croatia's accession to the EU because of a row over assets of the Ljubljanska Bank.
The two countries have been locked into a bitter dispute over demands for compensation from Croats who had deposited money in the bank before 1991.
Analysts say Rupel's statement signals a shift in Slovenian policy, as Ljubljana had threatened to block Croatia's integration only last week.
The change apparently followed the weekend EU foreign ministers' meeting in Salzburg.

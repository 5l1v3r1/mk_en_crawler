BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom praised efforts by Serbian police and the effects of abolishing visa requirements for Serbian citizens, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Monday (July 12th) in Brussels, after meeting with the EU official. 
Dacic added that Malmstrom welcomed Serbia's efforts against organised crime and drug trafficking. 
He pointed out that the number of Serbians seeking asylum in EU countries has dropped, after initial problems surfaced immediately after visa liberalisation went into effect in December. 
He also voiced Serbia's support for abolishing visas for all Balkan countries, describing it as important for regional stability.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- UN prosecutors in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic presented documents on Tuesday (7 June) demonstrating that the infamous Scorpions paramilitary group, which fought in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1992-1995 conflict, was in fact a regular Serbian police unit.
A recently released video showed Scorpions executing young Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995.
Prosecutors say Milosevic had direct control of the unit and was therefore responsible for its actions.
In Belgrade, the videotaped executions prompted all parties in the Serbian Parliament to back a joint resolution condemning all war crimes and calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice.

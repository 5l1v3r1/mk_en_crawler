ATHENS, Greece -- Minister for European Affairs Tassos Yiannitsis said Tuesday (6 May) that his government is drafting a roadmap for bringing the Balkan countries into the EU. 
The accession plans, popularly known as "roadmaps," outline the measures and reforms candidate countries must implement if they want to join the Union. 
Bulgaria and Romania received similar roadmaps at the EU summit in Copenhagen last December. 
They are on track for membership in 2007. 
Following a meeting with his Croatian counterpart, Ivan Simonovic, Yiannitsis told reporters it was too early to say whether Croatia would be able to catch up with the two other countries and join the EU in 2007.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A UN police spokesman said Tuesday (22 July) that Kosovo has seen a dramatic decline in ethnic-related murders and in crime in general.
In all, 38 murders were committed in the first six months of 2003;
five of the victims were Serbs.
None of these killings is believed to have been ethnically motivated.
During the same period in 2001, 30 Serbs were killed in hate attacks.
UN Police spokesman Barry Fletcher noted that the murder rate in Kosovo was now lower than in some countries of Western Europe.

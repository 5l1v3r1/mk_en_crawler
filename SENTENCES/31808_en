WASHINGTON, United States -- The House of Representatives and Senate passed similar versions of an emergency spending package Thursday (3 April), providing the Pentagon with some $60 billion to fight the war in Iraq. 
In one key amendment, the House backed President George W Bush by supporting $1 billion for aid to Turkey. 
Lawmakers intend to reconcile differences between the House and Senate measures, and send Bush a final bill by 11 April.
In other news Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul complained about the war's negative impact on his country's economy. 
He added, however, that his government has not sent troops into northern Iraq and would only do so in the event of a major refugee crisis or if the Kurdistan Workers Party uses the area as a base for attacks on Turkey.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Catholic priest from Italy was hurt in an assault in western Turkey on Sunday (December 16th), the latest in a series of attacks against Christians in the country. 
A 19-year-old man stabbed Father Adriano Franchini in the stomach after an argument over religion at Izmir's St Antoine Church. 
The priest heads the Church of St Mary in Ephesus. 
Local media reported that he went through surgery and his condition was not life threatening.
In February 2006, another Italian priest -- Andrea Santore -- was killed by Turkish nationalists at the Black Sea coastal town of Trabzon. 
In April of this year, members of an ultranationalist organisation attacked a Christian publishing house in the town of Malatya in eastern Turkey, killing three people.

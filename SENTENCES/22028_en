PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Malaysia has not halted the process of recognising Kosovo's independence, Mustafa Mansor, head of Malaysia's liaison office in Pristina, said on Thursday (August 14th). 
Mansor told President Fatmir Sejdiu his government has not changed its stance on Kosovo's status, despite a claim to that effect by the Serbian Foreign Ministry earlier this week. 
Shortly after Kosovo declared independence in February, Malaysia said it welcomed the move.
Also Thursday, UNMIK spokesperson Russell Geekie said UNMIK and EULEX will sign a memorandum of understanding this month on technical aspects of UNMIK's restructuring and the EU mission's new responsibilities. 
EULEX is to deploy and operate in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
In other news Thursday, doctors throughout Kosovo went on strike demanding better pay and working conditions. 
The healthcare workers' trade union said the strike aims to remind the government of its responsibilities to the health sector.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski acknowledged on Monday (20 October) that he does not expect spectacular results from the six-week voluntary disarmament campaign, due to start on 1 November. 
Buckovski described it as a mostly symbolic gesture associated with the peace process and implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. 
He cited latest reports by NGOs that estimate civilians hold more than 100,000 illegal weapons.
In other news Monday, the government dismissed Security and Counterintelligence Bureau Director Zoran Verusevski and the Director of the Public Enterprise for Management of Business and Residential Premises Darko Babamov. 
Cabinet spokesman Saso Colakovski said the removals were unrelated to performance, rather was in response to allegations of nepotism.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian and Kosovo officials met in Belgrade on Wednesday (16 March) to discuss the issue of those still missing from the 1998-1999 conflict.
It was the first meeting on technical issues between the two sides in more than a year.
An official from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is mediating the talks, said they were "an important step forward in what we hope will be a process that brings clarity for thousands of families".
Participants said they have established a framework for resolving the problem.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The deputy chief prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal, David Tolbert, said Tuesday (26 April) that the trials of three Serb generals indicted for Kosovo-related crimes -- Vladimir Lazarevic, Sreten Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic -- would be held in The Hague. 
The tribunal recently proposed transfering ten war crimes cases to local courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia, but Tolbert indicated that would not apply to the three generals. 
Pavkovic makes his first appearance before the tribunal on Thursday.
In other news, Bulgarian police announced that they have detained former Yugoslav Army General Cedomir Brankovic. 
In 1999, a court in Croatia sentenced him in absentia to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed against Croatian civilians in August 1991. 
Zagreb is now seeking his extradition.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- In both Serbia and Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbs marked the 14th anniversary of Operation Storm, the Croatian army offensive that killed hundreds of Serb civilians.
President Boris Tadic attended a memorial service Tuesday (August 4th) at St. Marko church in Belgrade.
Serb opposition parties condemned the offensive and demand that state institutions and international organisations insist that Croatia guarantee the safe return of refugees.
An estimated 200,000 Serb civilians living in Croatia fled to Serbia seeking refuge because of the operation.

Suspect charged in murder of former BiH police chief
SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Prosecutors filed charges Monday (August 3rd) against Djordje Zdrale for the June 2000 murder of former Republika Srpska (RS) police chief Ljubisa "Mauzer" Savic.
Zdrale was arrested in Germany in January and transferred to BiH in February.
Savic was gunned down nine years ago in the town of Bijelina.
During the 1992-1995 conflict, he commanded a Serb paramilitary group called the Panthers.
He became RS police chief after the fighting ended.
In other news Tuesday, Interpol announced it has issued an arrest warrant for former mujahedeen fighter Karaj Kamel bin Ali, also known as Abu Hamza, who escaped BiH's Zenica prison on July 27th.
Hamza, who was serving a sentence for murder and other crimes, failed to return to the facility as scheduled after a seven-day leave.
He is on a list of people who pose a threat to national security because of his suspected ties to terrorist organisations.

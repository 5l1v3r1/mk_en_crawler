PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police Director Behar Selimi removed Zoran Milkovic from his post as commander of the Jarinje police station, on Tuesday (August 24th) due to "poor performance".
The decision comes within the framework of an overall police overhaul, Selimi said at a press conference, adding other police commanders across Kosovo will be replaced in the coming days.
Selimi is transferring Milkovic to Bernjak where he will have less responsibility, compared to Jarinje where up to 5,000 people cross the border daily.
Milkovic, a representative of the Serb minority, was serving at the crossing point between northern Kosovo and Serbia.

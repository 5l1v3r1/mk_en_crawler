BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU on Tuesday (24 January) welcomed Turkey's proposal to lift all economic sanctions against Cyprus.
Union Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul's initiative is "intended as a basis for further discussion with the concerned parties under the auspices of the UN".
The plan, which was also submitted to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, includes opening Turkish ports to Greek Cypriot ships, allowing Greek Cypriot planes to fly over Turkish territory, and opening Turkish Cypriot ports to international business.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR announced on Saturday (9 August) that it would monitor closely Republika Srpska's massive auction of surplus arms and equipment.
The army of the Serb entity plans to sell 105 tanks, 42,048 infantry weapons, 98 artillery pieces, 68 air defence weapons, 21 anti-aircraft missiles, over a million mine parts, and more than 13 million rounds of ammunition and artillery shells.
"SFOR will monitor any movement or export of these weapons," read an SFOR statement.
Only licensed arms dealers checked by SFOR would be allowed to bid.
Anything remaining at the end of the year would be destroyed, said the Bosnian Serb defence ministry.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission has made upward revisions to the budget deficits reported by Greece during the past several years, a spokesman said Tuesday (21 September). 
He refused to disclose figures prior to Eurostat's official announcement, expected at the end of this week or early next week. 
A German newspaper reported that the figures for 2000, 2001 and 2002 had been revised, amid findings that the budget deficit was much larger than Athens reported. 
The Greek government has already posted a new higher number for the 2003 deficit and has calculated that this year's shortfall would reach 5.3 per cent, well above the EU's 3 per cent ceiling.

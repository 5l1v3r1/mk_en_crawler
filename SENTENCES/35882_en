BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The three democratic parties -- the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), G17 Plus and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia -- have come up with a final version of an agreement on a minority government, DSS deputy head Dragan Marsicanin said Tuesday (20 January). 
All it needs is official endorsement, a formality. 
The document includes the government's general goals and how cabinet posts will be distributed, without naming names. 
But Democratic Party (DS) deputy head Boris Tadic says his party would not support a minority government, making further talks likely.
In other news, accused Zemun clan member Aleksandar Zdravkovic reportedly has been arrested. 
An arrest warrant was issued following the March assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, though sources indicate Zdravkovic may not be linked directly.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader rejected on Saturday (June 9th) a proposal from the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) to strip Croats in BiH of their right to vote in elections or referendums in Croatia.
"All Croatian citizens are equal in the eyes of the constitution and have the same rights and responsibilities.
We can not have first class and second class citizens," Sanader was quoted as saying.
In an interview Saturday with Dnevni Avaz, SDP leader Zoran Milanovic insisted Croats in BiH have lived in a foreign country for more than thousand years and therefore could not be considered a diaspora.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) and the coalition of pro-European forces led by President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) are close to reaching agreement on a new government, local media reported on Tuesday (June 10th). 
They have settled almost all details except for the distribution of cabinet posts. 
Blic and Vecernje Novosti for example write that DS's partners refuse to allow SPS leader Ivica Dacic to become the new prime minister. 
Blic says the DS has offered him the post of deputy prime minister responsible for security services.

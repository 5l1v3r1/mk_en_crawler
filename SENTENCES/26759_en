PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The recount of votes in the municipality of Gjilan/Gnjilane started on Wednesday (January 6th) at the Counting and Results Centre in Pristina. 
Mayoral candidates from the two main parties, the Democratic Party and the Democratic League (LDK), finished neck to neck in the mid-December run-off. 
After receiving complaints mainly from the LDK, the Central Elections Commission (CEC) opted to recount rather than organise a third round of voting, as is being done in Prizren and Lipjan/Lipljane. 
The Gjilan/Gnjilane recount hit a snag early on, as observers from the LDK showed up only late in the day to protest the CEC's decision against a revote. 
Results of the recount are expected on Friday.

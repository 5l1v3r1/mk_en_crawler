ATHENS, Greece -- Katerina Thanou, the Greek sprinter who made headlines during the 2004 Summer Olympics when she failed to appear for a doping test, denied she ever took drugs.
"An athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he/she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment," she said in an interview published Sunday (27 March).
Thanou and former Olympic champion Kostas Kenteris were cleared by the Greek Athletic Federation.
However, the International Association of Athletics Federations will likely appeal that finding.

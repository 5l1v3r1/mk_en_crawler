BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's government dismissed two senior representatives of the junior coalition partner Social Democratic Party (SDP) on Thursday (25 August), following a dispute over the privatisation of the state-owned oil giant NIS. 
SDP refused to back the effort in parliament earlier this week. 
As expected, Kosovo co-ordinator Nebojsa Covic and information directorate chief Slobodan Orlic were sacked, after rejecting Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's demand that they resign. 
The cabinet may also fire other SDP representatives holding seats on the boards of public companies. 
The draft law paving the way for NIS's sale is crucial to continued IMF support of Serbia.
In other news Thursday, Serbia-Montenegro government partner G17 Plus announced it plans to replace member Prvoslav Davinic as federal defence minister. 
The move follows increasing criticism of his job performance.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- An appeals court in Belgrade has overturned the acquittal of two former Serb policemen charged in the so-called Bytyqi war crimes case, ordering a retrial, the war crimes prosecutor's office announced on Monday (November 29th).
Last December, Sreten Popovic and Milos Stojanovic were found not guilty by a first instance court due to a lack of evidence.
The two were charged with involvement in the 1999 murders of three Albanian brothers with US citizenship -- Agron, Mehmet and Illy Bytyqi.
They allegedly handed the Bytyqi brothers over to members of a special Serbian police unit, who shot them in their training camp.
The bodies were found in 2001 in a mass grave in the eastern village of Petrovo Selo.
The appeals court accepted an appeal by the prosecution in early November.
No date for the retrial has been set.

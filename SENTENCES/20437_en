BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of Serbs paid their respects on Wednesday (March 12th) to the memory of former Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who was gunned down five years ago.
His widow and two children -- together with Serbian President Boris Tadic and other members of Djindjic's Democratic Party (DS) -- laid flowers and lit candles on the grave.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica laid a wreath in front of the government building, where Djindjic was shot dead on March 12th, 2003.
Members of the government and thousands of other people gathered there to commemorate the murder of the Serbia's first democratically-elected prime minister.

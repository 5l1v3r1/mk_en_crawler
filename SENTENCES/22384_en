HELSINKI, Finland -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Monday (May 12th) that there is no slowdown in Turkey's reforms aimed at EU accession. 
Speaking to reporters in Helsinki, Babacan warned, however, that as long as the EU fails to set an exact date for Turkey's possible EU membership, the reform initiative will largely be up to Ankara. 
"We are the owner of the reforms â¦ We believe that the faster we make the reforms, the more useful they will be for Turkey. 
However, timelines and dates are for us to determine," Babacan said. 
During his stay in Helsinki, he met with Finnish President Tarja Halonen and Parliament Speaker Sauli Niinisto, as well as with counterpart Alexander Stubb, who described Turkey is a strategic partner and reiterated Finland's support for Ankara's EU bid.

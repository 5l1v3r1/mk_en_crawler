PRISTINA, Kosovo -- US Ambassador Christopher Dell is urging Kosovo politicians to forego an endless election cycle, and instead focus on the rule of law, good governance, and economic growth.
In an editorial published on Saturday (January 15th), Dell wrote that Kosovo needs an honest and efficient government.
"In such a government, there is no room at all for individuals who are believed to be above the law, or who are officially suspected of law violation," Dell said.
He added that security for judiciary personnel remains weak, and courts are still susceptible to political interference.
Incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), which attracted the most votes in the December 12th snap elections, welcomed Dell's remarks.
PDK member Rame Buja said on Sunday that the new government must be run by people with "clean hands", which he indicated is a difficult but not impossible task.

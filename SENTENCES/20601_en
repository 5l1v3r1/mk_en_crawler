BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic suggested on Monday (December 10th) that the country would ask the UN Security Council to seek the opinion of the International Court of Justice, the UN body that settles disputes between countries, on the possible independence of Kosovo. 
Tadic added this would be an important argument in the Security Council's debate on Kosovo's future status, which is scheduled for December 19th.
Separately Monday, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told reporters that the country will never strike a deal with the EU to trade the Kosovo province's independence for faster EU integration. 
He insisted the future status of Kosovo should be decided by the Security Council.
Later in the day, Serbia opened a government branch office in the ethnically divided northern city of Mitrovica, reportedly in a bid to underscore Belgrade's territorial claim on Kosovo.

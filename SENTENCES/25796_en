BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested more than 30 members of rightist groups Sunday (September 20th) for disturbing public order in Belgrade, police director Milorad Veljovic said.
Ignoring a ban imposed by authorities, they tried to gather for a rally to celebrate the cancellation of the Gay Pride Parade, which had been planned for Sunday.
The parade was called off due to threats by extremists.
Meanwhile, a group of extremists attacked Australian tourists in downtown Belgrade, slightly injuring one person.
The incident occurred days after French football fans in Belgrade were attacked by fans of the Serb club Partizan.

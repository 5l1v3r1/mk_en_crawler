BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Monday (June 2), government delegations from Serbia and Montenegro endorsed the final draft of an action plan on harmonising economic ties within the new union. 
Montenegrin Finance Minister Miroslav Ivanisevic and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic said the plan would be reviewed by the republican governments on Thursday. 
Jovanovic clarified that once the republican legislatures approve the plan, it would be tabled at the federal government level. 
The document should be ready prior to the 21 June EU summit.

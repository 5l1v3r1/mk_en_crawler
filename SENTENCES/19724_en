ANKARA, Turkey -- More than 100 police officers and protesters were injured and around 160 Kurds were arrested in a number of cities in southeast Turkey on Saturday (March 22nd) after police used tear gas and water cannons to deal with pro-Kurdish demonstrators.
The clashes happened a day after Nevruz, the Turkish New Year, which saw demonstrations in support of the Kurdistan Workers' Party.
In eastern Turkey's Van province, police dispersed about 1,500 people who built barricades, started fires and broke the windows of shops and public institutions.
Similar incidents also occurred in the city of Hakkari, near the border with Iraq, and in Sanliurfa, Viransehir, Mersin and Izmir.
Also in the news, authorities confirmed on Saturday a new bird flu outbreak in the Edirne province.
More than 1,000 chickens were killed to stop the spread of the disease.
It is still not clear if the virus found in the birds was the deadly H5N1 strain, which affects humans.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The state commission in charge of examining 1,500 cases of granted citizeship has established 38 cases of illegally granted citizenship, BiH Security Minister Barisha Colak said Wednesday (21 June). 
Decisions to revoke the citizenship are expected soon. 
The results suggest that most cases involve citizens of Afro-Asian origin, who arrived in BiH during the war, Colak said. 
The inquiry commission was formed in February and must complete its work in a six-month term.

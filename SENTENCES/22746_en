SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The parliament of Republika Srpska (RS) warned it would use "all means" to protect Bosnian Serbs against hard-line comments that threaten to fan interethnic tensions in BiH, local media reported on Thursday (October 9th). 
RS lawmakers did not rule out a possible referendum on independence as one possible measure. 
"RS expresses its readiness to use all legal and political measures, including the right to a referendum, to defend its legitimate interests and protect its identity confirmed by the Dayton Peace Accords," said a note prepared by parliament that is to be discussed at an extraordinary session Monday. 
At issue is a statement by BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic, who questioned the viability of the Dayton Peace Accord in a speech to the UN General Assembly last month.

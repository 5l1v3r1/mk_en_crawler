SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's Central Election Commission (CEC) has registered 22 parties and coalitions for participation in the 25 June parliamentary elections, CEC spokesman Biser Troyanov said Monday (16 May). 
Troyanov said all the current parliamentary parties and coalitions registered, as well as the larger non-parliamentary formations. 
He added that the applications of 11 organisations were rejected due to irregular documents; seven have appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. 
The election campaign will officially begin on 25 May.

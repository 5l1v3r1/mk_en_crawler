TIRANA, Albania -- Albania has secured a 44m-euro loan from Germany to link its electricity grid to Montenegro and the rest of Southeast Europe.
The money, provided by Germany's government-owned KfW Bank, will be spent on a 128km link to the border with Montenegro.
The project is part of a plan to connect the electricity grids of all countries in the region by 2005, with a view to market deregulation.
Also Friday, the government approved the National Migration Strategy.
It aims to improve the economic, social and political situation of Albanian emigrants through increased co-operation with host countries.
In other news Friday, Albanian Foreign Minister Kastriot Islami said the government hopes to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU next year.
He noted, though, that this goal is not based on any EU promise and that achieving it would depend greatly on how the 2005 general elections are conducted.

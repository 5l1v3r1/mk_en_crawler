SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria's entry into the EU on 1 January 2007 remains a feasible goal, according to the head of the European Commission's enlargement directorate, Fabrizio Barbaso.
He began a two-day visit to Sofia on Monday (25 July).
Following talks with Bulgarian Parliamentary Speaker Georgi Pirinski, Barbaso called for the acceleration of work related to the EU accession process and stressed that the country could not afford to waste time.
A strong government should be established and start work immediately, Barbaso said, adding that even a minority government could realise the strategic objective of joining the EU.
In other news, a EU team of experts arrived in Bulgaria on Tuesday to evaluate the effects of the recent heavy floods.
The experts -- sent at the request of the Bulgarian government -- are to propose a strategy for rebuilding the damaged areas.
It will then be submitted to Brussels for funding.

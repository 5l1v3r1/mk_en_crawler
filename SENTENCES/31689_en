SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The situation involving human rights in BiH remains poor, according to the annual report of the BiH Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.
At a news conference Friday (10 January), Srdjan Dizdarevic of the NGO's management board said BiH authorities and the international community are to blame.
He said they failed to take measures necessary to protect the most vulnerable, particularly refugees.
He cited the number of attacks on returnees and minority returnees as proof that much remains to be done in establishing the rule of law and democratic standards.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Romania on Thursday (18 November) called for Bulgarian authorities to release a Romanian journalist arrested earlier this week for spying. 
PRO TV reporter George Buhnici was detained in Ruse with a mini camera and a microphone hidden in his eyeglasses. 
He says he was conducting an undercover investigation of shady dealings at the duty-free customs shops in Romania and Bulgaria.
In other news, a Sofia court handed down a one-year conditional sentence to former Bulgarian security chief Atanas Atanasov, convicting him of charges related to the illegal surveillance of a state prosecutor in 2000. 
Atanasov was arrested earlier this week for refusing to pay bail.

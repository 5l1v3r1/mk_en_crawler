THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who is charged with crimes against Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s, objected on Wednesday (July 4th) to starting his trial at The Hague on November 6th.
Seselj says he needs more time to prepare his defence -- until March of 2008 at the earliest.
Proceedings originally began last November, but had to be suspended after he launched a hunger strike, demanding the right to represent himself.
The Appeals Chamber eventually sided with him.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK and Kosovo Serb representatives met on Thursday (August 14th) to discuss the functioning of the judiciary in northern Kosovo and the reopening of the court in Mitrovica. 
In March, the facility was at the centre of a protest by Serb judicial workers that turned into deadly rioting, when UNMIK and KFOR stormed the building to arrest the demonstrators. 
As for Thursday's meeting, UNMIK head of judicial development Elizabeth Rolando said, "Hopefully, an adequate solution will be found, one that will be acceptable for all communities." (B92, Tanjug - 14/08/08)

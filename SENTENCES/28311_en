BUDAPEST, Hungary -- President Laszlo Solyom hosted a meeting in Pecs on Friday (April 16th) with his Croatian counterpart Ivo Josipovic and Serbian President Boris Tadic to discuss ways to boost co-operation among their countries.
Solyom, whose country assumes the EU's rotating presidency in January, said Hungary strongly supports the EU bids of both Belgrade and Zagreb.
Tadic said he would like to see Croatia become an EU member as soon as possible, because this would signal that Serbia too will fulfil its strategic goal.
Josipovic said he hopes his country can wrap up its accession talks by the end of this year.
The three presidents agreed they'd like to see the post of European commissioner for ethnic minorities established.

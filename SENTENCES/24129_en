PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi says Kosovo institutions -- not the EULEX mission -- must investigate the possible involvement of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in war crimes.
"I am convinced that the result of the investigations will be positive for Kosovo and the KLA, since most of what has been said recently is groundless and we are convinced that our war was fair," Krasniqi said on Tuesday (April 14th).
EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon confirmed earlier that the EULEX is ready to look into reports that the KLA trafficked organs from Serb prisoners held in Albanian prisons a decade ago.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has criticised such reports as libel.

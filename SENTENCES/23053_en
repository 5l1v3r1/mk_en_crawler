SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Transparency InternationalâBosnia and Herzegovina (TI BiH) issued a statement Wednesday (July 2nd) rejecting accusations by certain businessmen and by Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik of the organisation's involvement in racketeering and the blackmailing of RS businessmen. 
The anti-corruption NGO demanded that entity- and national-level authorities, as well as the international community, stop tolerating such treatment of independent civil society groups.
On Tuesday, Dodik said he was aware of malpractice on the part of TI BiH and promised to protect those whom it allegedly targeted. 
He also urged prosecutors to actively investigate the matter.

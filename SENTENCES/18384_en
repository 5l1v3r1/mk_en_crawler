TIRANA, Albania -- Unlike the ruling Democratic Party, opposition parties support Alfred Moisiu's candidacy for second term as president, Social Democratic Party head Skender Gjinushi said on Thursday (May 10th).
He says Moisiu could become a consensus candidate for the opposition.
Earlier this week, the leaders of the Socialist Party and the SMI -- Edi Rama and Ilir Meta respectively -- indicated they could support Moisiu's re-election.
But two days ago, the ruling coalition declared its opposition to the possibility of a second term.

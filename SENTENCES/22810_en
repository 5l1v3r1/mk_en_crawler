BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic expressed dissatisfaction Thursday (November 6th) with Serbia's slow progress towards potential EU membership, saying the EU should impose no new conditions.
Speaking at a conference in Belgrade dubbed "Serbia and the EU, Strengthening European Perspective", Jeremic reacted sharply to European Commission officials who suggested they expected co-operation on the issue of the EU's new mission in Kosovo, EULEX.
The opposition insists negotiations on EULEX amount to formal recognition of the breakaway province.
Jeremic reiterated that Serbia will never recognise Kosovo and the EU should not make recognition a condition for candidate status.

The Men's World Handball Championship in Zagreb wrapped up on Sunday (February 1st) with the final match. 
France won gold, not a surprise after its gold medal last summer in the Olympic Games in Beijing.
More than 15,000 spectators cheered the Croatian team in the newly opened Zagreb Arena, but the French team won a tight, fast and suspenseful game against Croatia, 24-19. 
Handball is tremendously popular in Croatia, in part because its national team has been one of the top teams in the world for years.
Fans' expectations for the home team ran high during the tournament, in which seven Croatian cities hosted 24 national teams. 
The defeat by France -- Croatia's only loss during the two-week tournament -- disappointed the team and its followers. 
However, it did have one individual standout: officials named Igor Vori the tournament's best player.
After the game, the Croatian players shunned the media to celebrate with fans in the capital's main square. 
Braving the inclement weather, a few thousand people gathered to honour the team.
Overall, the tournament ran smoothly, but it encountered some glitches. 
During the semifinal contest between Croatia and Poland in Zagreb, technical problems forced organisers to interrupt the match five times.
Furthermore, the Serbian national team had to face considerable local hostility in Zadar, a southern city that suffered heavy casualties during the 1990s conflict. 
The mayor removed all national flags from the town's central square rather than let the Serbian flag fly, earning him a sharp rebuke from Croatian officials.
On Monday, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader congratulated the team at a ceremony in Zagreb. 
Sanader told the players their "silver shines like gold".
"We are so proud of you. 
Without you and your great play, Croatia would not have six new sports halls," Sanader said.

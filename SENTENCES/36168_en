SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said Wednesday (10 March) that Bulgaria will soon request that the United States remove visas for Bulgarian citizens, just as Poland and the Czech Republic have.
Like Bulgaria, the countries have sent troops to Iraq.
The US Embassy in Bulgaria says it has received no official request yet.

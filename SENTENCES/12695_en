PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Kosovo government and UNMIK have asked the international community to donate funds for the rebuilding of what once was the largest Roma neighbourhood in Yugoslavia.
Roma Mahala in Mitrovica was destroyed in revenge attacks after the 1999 conflict ended.
Some 800 of its former residents still live in a camp protected by KFOR troops.
Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi told diplomats Thursday (5 May) that the problem is humanitarian rather than political.
The Kosovo government has set aside 200,000 euros for reconstruction, but UNMIK estimates it will cost several million euros.
The refugees have refused to accept accommodation elsewhere in the province.

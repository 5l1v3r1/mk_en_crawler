NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said late last week that he would get personally involved in the talks on reuniting Cyprus if no agreement is reached by 22 March. 
Greek and Turkish media are reporting that if the current talks turn out to be fruitless, Annan will call a 24 March meeting in Lucerne, Switzerland between representatives of the Turkish Cypriots, the Greek Cypriots, Turkey and Greece. 
The final deadline for finding a solution is 1 May -- the date Cyprus is set to join the EU.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic says that claims by Carla del Ponte, the UN tribunal's chief prosecutor, regarding indictee Ratko Mladic hiding in Serbia are sound.
In an exclusive interview in Monday's Belgrade daily Blic, Vukcevic adds that Mladic has repeatedly eluded capture due to a lack of co-ordination among domestic services.
Vukcevic and Rasim Ljajic, chairman of the national council for co-operation with the tribunal, recently were tapped to manage the government's action plan for capturing Mladic.
Co-ordination already has improved significantly, Vukcevic said.

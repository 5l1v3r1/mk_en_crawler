BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, a son of the last Yugoslav king, Peter II, spoke on Wednesday (24 May) about the possibility of restoring the monarchy in Serbia in the wake of the Montenegrin independence referendum. 
In a statement for the local media, he said a constitutional parliamentary monarchy could be the answer to Serbia's mounting problems. 
Such a move would attract investment, spur economic growth, help create jobs and provide "the fastest way forward to the EU", Karadjordjevic said.

Bulgaria unveiled a new demographic development strategy Monday (6 March), aimed at preventing a crisis that could lead to a dramatic population reduction over the next decades.
According to the US Census Bureau, Bulgaria's population could shrink to about 4.7 million by 2050. 
Different sources currently estimate it at between 7.5 million and 7.8 million.
The country's chronic demographic crisis has become a national security problem, President Georgi Parvanov said in January, urging the government to draw up a plan to deal with it.
Unveiling the strategy Monday, Labour and Social Policy Minister Emilia Maslarova said one of the goals is to increase life expectancy by two years by 2020. 
According to WHO statistics, life expectancy at birth in Bulgaria is 69 years for males and 76 years for females. 
According to the social ministry, it has increased by only 8 months over the past 14 years. 
Meanwhile, the death rate is estimated to have reached 14.3 deaths per 1,000 in 2005.
The strategy, which must be approved by parliament for resources to be allocated under the 2007 budget, also envisions measures for bringing birth and mortality rates in line with EU standards.
"The demographic trends in Bulgaria are extreme compared to the EU," the AFP quoted Maslarova as saying.
The main goal of the strategy is to achieve "a reproduction of quality" through different measures, including improving healthcare for children and pregnant women, providing financial incentives to young couples, such as housing credits, and establishing a network of infant childcare. 
The ministry wants all mothers-to-be to receive proper medical attention from the very first months of pregnancy, lowering the risks of perinatal deaths, the social policy ministry said.
Two specific targets in the plan are reducing infant mortality from 12.3 per 1,000 (in 2004) to 9.5 in 2015 and 7 in 2020, and increasing the fertility rate from 1.2 children per woman of childbearing age to 1.5 by the end of the next decade.
Another ambitious goal is to bring down the number of abortions in the country from the current level of 750 terminated pregnancies for every 1,000 live births to 550 per 1,000 by 2015. 
The social policy ministry also wants to reduce the rate of births out of wedlock, currently standing at 48 per cent of all births, and of teenage pregnancies.
Over 70 per cent of Bulgarian babies are born into very poor families and are "threatened with social exclusion," according to Maslarova.
The majority of Bulgaria's Roma, said to account for between 5 per cent and 9 per cent of the country's population, according to different sources, are also among the nation's poorest people. 
At the same time, the birthrate within that community is higher than that of other ethnic groups in Bulgaria.
The envisioned measures also seek to ensure a sharp decrease in the number of highly educated youth leaving the country. 
On average, some 16,000 people leave Bulgaria every year, according to the ministry, which wants to halve that number by 2015.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prosecutors have charged the wife of fugitive former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic with illegal arms possession, the Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti reported on Saturday (July 10th). 
The weapons -- an automatic gun, a hunting rifle and several pistols -- were allegedly seized during a December 2008 raid of the family home in Belgrade. 
Bosiljka Mladic was detained last month for questioning about the weapons.

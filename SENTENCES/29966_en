ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Saturday (December 25th) that Turkey is willing to reconcile with Israel but still seeks an apology for the deadly raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish-led flotilla in late May.
He called on Tel Aviv to compensate the families of nine Turkish activists killed that day.
"If our friendship with Israel is going to continue, an apology and compensation are the only possible outcome," he told journalists.
He was speaking on the eve of the return to Istanbul of the Mavi Marmara, the ship that led the flotilla.

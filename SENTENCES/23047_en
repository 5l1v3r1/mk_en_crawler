TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Monday (September 1st) vowed to pass a legislative package intended to move forward reforms regarding the judicial and election systems and the secret services. 
At a meeting with lawmakers from his ruling Democratic Party, Berisha said he backs the draft law on prosecutors' status, which envisions the forfeiture of their immunity. 
The association of prosecutors has criticised the proposed draft, saying it would threaten their independence.
Socialist Party leader Edi Rama also discussed electoral reform with other socialist political leaders on Monday. 
Rama met with Social Democratic Party leader Skender Gjinushi and Party of Social Democracy leader Paskal Milo. 
The second largest opposition party, the Socialist Movement for Integration, did not attend the meeting.

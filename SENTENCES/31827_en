SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government and the UNDP are jointly preparing a programme to collect and control light weapons still held by civilians following the 2001 war with rebels.
On Wednesday (2 April), Interior Minister Hari Kostov and Resident Representative and UN Resident Co-ordinator in Macedonia Frode Mauring signed a Letter of Acceptance, which includes $230,000 in UNDP assistance.
It would pay for a media blitz, aimed at increasing public awareness of the need to voluntarily hand over some 500,000 illegally held weapons.
The project would last for six months.

ATHENS, Greece -- More than 10,000 people gathered in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki on Saturday (September 6th) to protest against the government's economic policy.
The rally was organised by the General Confederation of Workers of Greece.
Demonstrators marched through the city just as Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was giving his annual speech on the economy at the opening of the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair.
Some protesters threw homemade bombs, and a number of businesses were damaged.
Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd and arrested 10 people.
In addition, four people were slightly injured during clashes between two rival protest groups.

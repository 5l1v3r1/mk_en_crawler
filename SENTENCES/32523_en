BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was assassinated Wednesday (12 March) in front of the main government building in Belgrade.
Djindjic, 50, died on the operating table at a Belgrade hospital of two gunshot wounds.
Djindjic narrowly escaped injury in another incident last month when a truck suddenly swerved out of its lane toward his convoy of cars.
He suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out organised crime, which flourished during the rule of former President Slobodan Milosevic.

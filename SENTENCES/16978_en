BRUSSELS, Belgium -- UN envoy for the Kosovo status talks Martti Ahtisaari announced in Brussels on Wednesday (3 May) that he would visit Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and China, starting in mid-May.
The trip was planned within the framework of efforts to complete negotiations on the province's final status.
On Wednesday, the Serbian daily Vecernje Novosti published a statement by Ahtisaari, who again urged Serbs and Albanians to demonstrate more co-operation in resolving the status problem.
The fourth round of UN-mediated talks between teams from Belgrade and Pristina was due to begin in Vienna Thursday.
Separately, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic explicitly ruled out Serbian acceptance of an independent Kosovo, speaking to reporters during a regional summit in Thessaloniki on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the leaders of Kosovo's different religious communities wrapped up a two-day meeting in Pec.
They appealed for reconciliation and unity in rebuilding the province.

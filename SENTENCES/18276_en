TIRANA, Albania -- The European Commission's (EC) Delegation in Tirana issued a statement on Tuesday (December 12th), calling on the various political parties to work constructively and assume responsibility for the conduct of next month's local elections.
Local politicians should not expect the international community or the EU to arbitrate disputes, the statement read.
On Monday, the main opposition Socialist Party announced it would boycott the January 20th vote, another salvo in the ongoing dispute with the ruling Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, President Alfred Moisiu again urged the parties to find some consensus.

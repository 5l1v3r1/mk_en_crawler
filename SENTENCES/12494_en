BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey has done "a very good job" in meeting the EU's standards for accession, outgoing US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Wednesday (8 December).
He declined to urge the EU to launch negotiations with Ankara, but noted the country has succeeded in meeting "fundamental concerns" about its readiness to begin the admissions process.
Also in Brussels, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul met with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday.
Gul reiterated Ankara's objections to the notion of open-ended accession talks.

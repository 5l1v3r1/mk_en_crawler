ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will seek a consensus with the opposition regarding the next presidential candidate.
In a weekend interview in the local Aksam daily, Erdogan said that AKP will insist on nominating only one candidate, reached by an agreement with the opposition after alternatives are reviewed.
While the next president will be elected by parliament, the one after that will be elected by popular vote.

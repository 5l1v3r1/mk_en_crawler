SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Two coal miners died after a tunnel collapsed Wednesday (October 24th) in the Oranovo mine, near the town of Simitli in southern Bulgaria.
The workers were trapped 300m underground.
This is the second deadly incident at the mine this year.
In March, two people died in a methane gas explosion in a shaft.

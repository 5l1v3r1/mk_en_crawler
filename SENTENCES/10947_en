SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The NATO mission to BiH "wholeheartedly endorses" the plea of Radovan Karadzic's wife for his surrender.
According to a statement Friday (29 July) by Brigadier General Steven Schook, the commander of NATO troops in the country, the fugitive should give himself up to the UN war crimes tribunal for the sake of his family and his country.
Schook added he is confident Karadzic heard about the appeal, that was broadcast on Bosnian Serb television.
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack also welcomed the effort Friday and urged all local politicians to support and echo the call for surrender.
Authorities in Banja Luka and Belgrade also praised the move by Karadzic's wife, Ljiljana, and reiterated their commitment to full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.

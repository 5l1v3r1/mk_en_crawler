ANKARA, Turkey -- Amid rising tensions between the government and the military's general staff over the detention of top-level retired generals and active officers last week, the government is returning constitutional reform to the top of its political agenda. 
Speaking at the 19th EU Reform Monitoring Group meeting Sunday (February 28th), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the government will introduce a constitutional reform package to parliament soon, with additional amendments submitted by the end of March. 
He added that the proposal will not be a complete overhaul but would change specific articles, particularly those banning certain political parties. 
The constitution was drafted under the military regime that came to power after a 1980 coup d'etat. 
It gives the military the power to influence elected governments.

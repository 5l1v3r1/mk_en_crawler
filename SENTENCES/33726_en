ANKARA, Turkey -- Supreme Commander of NATO in Europe US General James Jones arrived on Tuesday (2 September) to discuss the possible deployment of Turkish peacekeepers to Iraq.
He meets on Wednesday with Army Chief of Staff Hilmi Ozkok and Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul.
According to local media, Jones will propose that Turkish troops in Iraq be deployed under Turkish command, making Turkey the third largest force in Iraq.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the media Tuesday that any decision would be made after the 22 September meeting of the National Security Council.
In other news, Erdogan met Tuesday in Berlin with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, seeking support for Turkey's EU accession efforts.
Erdogan said membership is in Germany's national interest, given the 2.5 million Turkish expatriates living there.

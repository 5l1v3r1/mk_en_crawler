SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev has approved the dismissal of Deputy Interior Minister Rumen Andreev, local media reported on Saturday (May 30th). 
The move stems from Andreev's decision to attend a birthday party in public on Friday, when a national day of mourning was in effect. 
The mourning was for 17 pilgrims killed by an out-of-control bus as they walked to an Orthodox festival on Thursday.
In other news, independent MPs Antoaneta Poneva and Eleonora Nikolova accused Labour Minister Emilia Maslarova on Friday of corruption and conflict of interest. 
The accusations stem from a project to reconstruct a social services centre in the city of Stara Zagora.

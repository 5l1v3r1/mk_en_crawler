ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis urged the EU on Friday (June 13th) to create a common policy to tackle illegal immigration, reiterating that his country's location makes it one of the most affected.
Karamanlis made this statement during a visit to the island of Samos.
Karamanlis repeated Greece's idea to create a joint European coast guard to patrol the EU's external sea borders.
Meanwhile, on Saturday, Greek authorities detained a total of 181 illegal immigrants in different parts of the country.

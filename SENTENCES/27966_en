WASHINGTON, United States -- The Senate has adopted a resolution congratulating Serbia on submitting its EU membership application and urging the EU to adopt a clear position on Serbia's bid in a timely manner, media reported on Thursday (April 22nd).
The Senate described EU prospects as a source of stabilisation, security and prosperity for all of Europe and said the EU should continue to support the integration efforts of countries in the Western Balkans.
At the same time, the senators urged Serbia to fully co-operate with The Hague war crimes tribunal and to arrest the two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
The EU is expected to discuss Serbia's EU membership application in June.

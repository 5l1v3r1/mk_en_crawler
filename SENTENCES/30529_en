ANKARA, Turkey -- Three Kurdish rebels were killed in a shootout with Turkish soldiers in the southeast on Tuesday (March 15th), the first clash since rebels announced the end of their unilateral ceasefire two weeks ago.
The incident happened in Sirnak province, near the border with Iraq and Syria, according to a statement by the military.
On February 28th, the PKK terminated its ceasefire, saying it would not attack Turkish targets but would defend its members more effectively.
They explained their decision was prompted by unsuccessful dialogue with the government.

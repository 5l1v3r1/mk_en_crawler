BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police on Friday (December 12th) launched a raid to search for fugitives, the war crimes prosecutor's office said in a statement. 
Security forces are searching several locations in the central town of Arandjelovac, about 50km south of Belgrade. 
The statement said the operation was ordered by war crimes prosecutor as part of efforts to locate, arrest and extradite to The Hague indictees, without specifying their identities. 
Media, however, reported the raid targeted former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic, who is accused by The Hague tribunal of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia. 
His arrest is crucial to Serbia's EU bid.

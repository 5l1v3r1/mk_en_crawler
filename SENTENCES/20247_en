BUCHAREST, Romania -- Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana announced on Tuesday (August 14th) that the party will file a motion for a no-confidence vote against the cabinet within weeks.
During an informal meeting at a mountain resort, the PSD said the government led by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu has lost the trust of Romanians and the majority of political parties.
The PSD also says the government has failed to absorb EU funds and to transfer the benefits of EU membership to the public.

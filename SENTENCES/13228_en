SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns voiced optimism about Macedonia's further progress in 2006, during a phone conversation with Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva on Friday (23 December).
Burns praised the obtaining of EU candidate status as a real success for Macedonia and recognition of its reform efforts.
He also told Mitreva that the country is a serious candidate for an invitation to join NATO.
In other news, EU envoy Erwan Fouere says the organisation and conduct of free and democratic elections will be Macedonia's main challenge in the year ahead.

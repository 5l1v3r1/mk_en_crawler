BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Acting Serbian President Natasha Micic said Wednesday (28 May) that expressing support for the independence of Kosovo before the final status of the province is resolved is not constructive.
Meeting with philanthropist and financier George Soros, she said Kosovo is an important part of Serbia.
During the meeting Soros suggested that Serbia would be "the fast track to EU" if Kosovo is given independence.
He also stressed the EU should seriously take on the task of making Kosovo independent but only if guarantees to ethnic Kosovo Serbs are made.
Meanwhile, UNMIK head Michael Steiner and Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi agreed to transfer jurisdiction in 19 areas from UNMIK to interim Kosovo institutions.
The transfer of powers, which has been strongly opposed both by Belgrade and by Kosovo Serbs, is to take place immediately.

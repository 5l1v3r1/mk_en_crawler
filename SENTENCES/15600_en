ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Orthodox Christians across Southeast Europe celebrated Easter on Sunday (23 April). 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I led prayers on Easter evening in the Church of St.

In his message, the patriarch called for peace and denounced violence and fanaticism. 
In Athens, Archbishop Christodoulos attacked "the murderous world order" and said the Church would provide hope for the future. 
Patriarch Pavle, leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church, urged Serbs to remain in Kosovo despite hardship and uncertainty. 
In Macedonia, President Branko Crvenkovski promised to promote religious and ethnic tolerance, while in Rome, Pope Benedict XVI joined Orthodox religious leaders' calls for peace and prayed for victims of flooding along the Danube River.

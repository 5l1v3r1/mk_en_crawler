STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Future EU presidency holder Sweden on Tuesday (September 9th) pledged its support for Serbia's accession to the Union.
Serbia's future lies in the EU, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said after meeting with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in Stockholm.
Both agreed that Belgrade has made significant progress towards achieving that goal.
Bildt stressed there is no longer any doubt about Serbia's co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, adding he is convinced that Belgrade is working hard to locate and arrest the two remaining war crime fugitives, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
Jeremic noted that one of Serbia's main priorities is to receive EU candidate status before Sweden's EU presidency begins in July 2009.

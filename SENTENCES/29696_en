TIRANA, Albania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele urged leaders in Tirana Wednesday (March 30th) to reach a compromise and end the political crisis for Albania to progress towards EU integration. 
"The political stalemate has to be resolved and the responsibility has to be shared amongst political leaders," Fuele said. 
Ensuring a democratic election process in the May 8th local vote is another crucial test, he pointed out, adding that the related OSCE recommendations must to be met.

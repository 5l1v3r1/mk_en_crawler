PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local media reported Monday (February 15th) that Kosovo's visa liberalisation process with EU countries is conditioned on the repatriation of thousands of Kosovo citizens living illegally across Europe.
The government says it has already reached a repatriation agreement with several EU countries, including France, Belgium and Switzerland, and is in the process of hammering out agreements with Germany and Scandinavian countries.
Human rights groups oppose the forced repatriation of Kosovo citizens due to poverty and difficult living conditions in Kosovo.

ATHENS, Greece -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer arrived in Athens on Monday (March 3rd) for meetings with Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis.
Afterwards, she said that now is the time to find a mutually acceptable solution to the longstanding name dispute with Macedonia, adding it would be unacceptable for a pact to expand if there are issues between its members.
For his part, de Hoop Scheffer said that while a dispute between a member and a candidate -- Macedonia -- should be taken into account, it has no direct impact on the accession talks.

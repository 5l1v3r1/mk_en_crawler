ZAGREB, Croatia -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said that Croatia is in the final stage of its EU integration process but urged more reforms to achieve the membership goal. 
After meeting President Ivo Josipovic on Thursday (November 25th) in Zagreb, Fuele pointed out that a lot has been done in the past years. 
He recalled, however, that the country still faces some challenges. 
Josipovic stated that authorities are aware they need to exert extra efforts in judiciary reform, to complete co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal and meet all economic criteria. 
Croatia aims to wrap up its EU accession talks and sign the accession treaty next year.

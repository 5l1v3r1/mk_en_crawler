ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Friday (December 31st) that 2011 will be the last year of recession for Greece. 
"If we work together, if we continue the effort which started in 2010, insisting on major changes, 2011 will be the last year of recession and in 2012 our country will return to growth, so that in 2013 we will have left behind the mistakes that led us to the current crisis," Papandreou said in speech marking the start of the New Year.

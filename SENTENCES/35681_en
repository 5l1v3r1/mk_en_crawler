ANKARA, Turkey -- The EU has added KADEK and Kongra-GEL, names used by the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), to its list of terrorist organisations. 
The updated list of terrorist organisations was published in the EU Official Gazette on Saturday (3 April); reports about the inclusion of the Turkish groups appeared in the local press on Monday. 
Belgium was the last EU member state to approve the move. 
Inclusion means that all the group's assets are subject to being frozen in the EU, while individual members are banned from entering member states.

TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister and former Minister of Transport Lulzim Basha appeared before the general prosecution on Monday (December 10th) to testify for investigations related to the Durres-Kukes highway deal.
The controversial deal led to the arrest of a number of senior officials in September for allegedly rigging tenders related to construction of the highway.
Basha, who oversaw the project as minister of transportation at that time, was questioned for two hours Monday.

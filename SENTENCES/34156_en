ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Monday (14 July) that the 7th and final EU reform package would be submitted to parliament this week and voted on next week.
Gul added that if further changes were necessary to adjust Turkish legislation to that of the EU, they would be accomplished through passage of single laws.
He stressed that the government continues to consider the military's opinion important in such matters.
Also Monday, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said the 7th package does not call for a reduction in the number of military representatives to Turkey's National Security Council.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- According to international media reports, the European Commission's progress report on Turkey praises Ankara's commitment to reform, but points out several areas where more efforts are needed.
The commission concludes that Turkey has achieved "a substantial institutional convergence ...
towards European standards", but advises Turkey to continue efforts to eliminate torture, improve legislation guaranteeing freedom of speech, enhance women's rights, and limit the "informal channels" through which the military exerts an influence on politics.
Speaking ahead of the report's official release, scheduled for Wednesday (6 October), EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen told the German newspaper <I>Bild am Sonntag</I>, that it might not be easy for Turkey to "swallow all that we have written".
He cited 2015 as a realistic accession date.
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Saturday that his country would not accept anything short of full membership in the EU.
He was referring to calls from some European politicians that Ankara should get a special partnership status rather than become a member.

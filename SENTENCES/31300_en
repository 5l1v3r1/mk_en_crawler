PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Municipal courts have started to process cases dealing with alleged manipulations that occurred during the December snap general elections.
The court in Gjakova has completed the two cases it received but the result remains unknown, media reported on Monday (January 31st).
Other municipal courts are dealing with 131 other cases, with the biggest number registered in Pristina -- 48, followed by Prizren with 26, and Peja with 14.
Most of the cases stem from complaints filed by the Vetevendosje movement.

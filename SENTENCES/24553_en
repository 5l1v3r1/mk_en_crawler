BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic denied on Friday (March 6th) a Wednesday Vecernje Novosti report that Belgrade had started talks with some EU members on whether it was acceptable to extradite former Serbian Croat leader Goran Hadzic first, rather than former Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, to unblock the ratification of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
Tadic said the report was "absolutely untrue ...Serbia is not choosing at this moment who will be arrested or not".
The Netherlands has insisted Serbia must meet its obligations to The Hague war crimes tribunal before it can implement its SAA.

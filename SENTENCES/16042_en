SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic said in a media interview that the issue of demarcation of Macedonia's northern border with Kosovo must be settled within the framework of the future agreement on the province's final status. 
Speaking to the local magazine Macedonia in Europe, Milovanovic stressed that the border issue must be finalised regardless of the outcome of the Kosovo status talks. 
She also stressed the importance of parliamentary elections later this year for Macedonia's aspirations to join NATO and the EU.

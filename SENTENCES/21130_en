PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo leaders and UNMIK reached an agreement Friday (August 31st) on a date for the province's parliamentary and local elections.
"In light of the Pristina negotiating team's request for parliamentary and municipal elections to take place in November, as required by the law, I have decided that these elections will be held on November 17th," UNMIK chief Joackim Ruecker said.
He warned that this date may be changed "should there be a conflict -- in particular should the holding of elections be used as an excuse to delay status settlement".

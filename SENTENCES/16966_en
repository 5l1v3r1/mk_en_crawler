ANKARA, Turkey -- A bomb blast injured 21 people, including 11 children, in the Turkish city of Hakkari on Wednesday (3 May).
The explosive device apparently was detonated by remote control while a military vehicle was passing by.
The vehicle was escorting a school bus full of servicemen's children.
None of the passengers in the bus were injured.
The children who were wounded were playing nearby when the bomb went off.
Also Wednesday, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer sealed a decree that redeploys experts in combating terrorism to key regions in Turkey's troubled southeast.
Cavit Cevik, former head of the Turkish police's anti-terror department, will handle Hakkari.
On Thursday, two military police officers went on trial in Van, charged with an attack on a shop owned by a supporter of the Kurdistan Workers Party.
One man was killed and another injured in the grenade attack last November in Semdinli, near the Iraqi border.
The prosecution says the officers were part of an execution squad, set up to target suspected insurgents.
No senior military figure in Turkey has ever been prosecuted for human rights abuses against the Kurds.

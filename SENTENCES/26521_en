SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Train drivers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) may halt work again on August 27th or 28th, trade unions warned on Monday (August 10th). 
Their demands remain the same as during a strike they staged on July 30th -- they want back wages owed them and want the government to drop plans to cut salaries in the sector by 10%. 
Train drivers also insist on the resignation of part of the state-controlled railway company management board.
Also Monday, FBiH's police trade union warned that its members will strike if their salaries are cut by 10% and if their main demand is not met -- that unified standards be implemented so interior ministry employees are paid the same, throughout the entity.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The main members of the ruling coalition, the Democratic Party (DS) and the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS), as well as the opposition Serbian Democratic Party (DSS), rejected the possibility Thursday (May 14th) of forming a caretaker government along with the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) until early elections later this year.
SNS leader Tomislav Nikolic said on Thursday he will seek allies to trigger early elections and suggested an interim government should serve until then.
Speaking at a rally in Nis, Nikolic called for a government that will be tough on crime and corruption and will guarantee decentralisation and a better living standard.
Both the DS and the SPS insist the ruling coalition is stable and dismissed the SNS proposal as absurd.
The DSS, led by Vojislav Kostunica, said while it generally favours the idea of early elections, it opposes the idea of any caretaker cabinet.

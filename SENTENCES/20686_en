BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A man who accused Republika Srpska officials of corruption died when his car blew up on Wednesday (November 7th).
Milan Vukelic, an employee of the town planning authority, accused his boss of taking bribes and the police of threatening him.
Police have refused to comment on the accusations, but revealed they had been investigating the bombing of another car owned by the victim and an arson attack on his mother's home.
Two people were seriously injured when Vukelic's car exploded on Banja Luka's main street, near the interior ministry building.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski visits Brussels on Tuesday (12 September) for talks with senior EU officials, his first visit there since assuming office.
Talks are expected to focus on the new Macedonian government's reform programme, as well as on relations between the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the major ethnic Albanian opposition party, the Democratic Union for Integration, which has been boycotting parliament since the July elections.
In other news, the government has decided to ask parliament to sack Chief Prosecutor Aleksandar Prcevski, citing numerous work violations.
As an opposition party, Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE had repeatedly accused Prcevski of inefficiency and yielding to political influence.

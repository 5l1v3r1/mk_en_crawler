SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, Sulejman Tihic, took over the rotating chairmanship of the presidency from Croat Dragan Covic on Saturday (28 February).
Tihic will hold the post for the next eight months.
On Friday, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic received three new candidacies for state defence minister.
No details have been disclosed.
The prime minister rejected the first candidate for the post submitted by the Serb Democratic Party, citing concerns over the nominee's wartime past.
International High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown's office said Saturday that he has forwarded a report to the BiH presidency on the EU's possible military role in the country.
The paper was presented by EU security chief Javier Solana at a session of the EU foreign ministers on 23 February.

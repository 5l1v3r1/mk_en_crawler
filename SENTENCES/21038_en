BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government approved a set of rules Thursday (August 2nd) for the upcoming Kosovo status negotiations and forwarded them to the Contact Group.
Slobodan Samardjic, minister for Kosovo, indicated Serbia's position on the framework has not changed significantly.
However, he acknowledged that Wednesday's comment by Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reflects a willingness to grant a greater degree of autonomy to Kosovo than previously envisaged.
Jeremic told the BBC that Serbia is willing to let Kosovo have separate representation in international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, along with some form of diplomatic representation.

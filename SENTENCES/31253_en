SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board urged Bosnian politicians Wednesday (December 1st) to form governments at all levels -- as soon as possible -- that will work to implement reforms and accelerate the country's EU and NATO bids. 
In a communiquÃ© released after their two-day meeting in Sarajevo, the Board's political directors also urged authorities "to establish, as a matter of priority, a transparent and effective mechanism for developing concrete constitutional reform proposals". 
They also called on politicians to pass a state-level law on the population census. 
The PIC reiterated that closing the Office of the High Representative and its transition into an EU Special Representative office depends on meeting necessary objectives and conditions.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee supported on Tuesday (October 6th) a proposal by the European Commission to scrap visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, starting in January.
But the committee went beyond that, asking that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania be included in the visa liberalisation process, though neither has met EU-determined benchmarks yet.
EP members also want to initiate visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo and establish a roadmap for visa-free travel.

PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana describes the Balkans as already a completely different region, well on the road to EU and NATO integration.
In an interview Sunday (March 8th) with Czech state television to mark ten years since NATO bombed Serbia, Solana said people should remember that a decade is a relatively short period of time, but much has been done to stabilise the Balkans during it.
Most countries are institutionally connected to the EU and NATO, Solana pointed out, adding that he believed the region would grow even closer to the two organisations.

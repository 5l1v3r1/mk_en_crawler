BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU criticised its two newest members, Bulgaria and Romania, on Wednesday (June 27th) for failing to significantly improve their fight against crime and corruption. 
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso released two assessments that conclude both countries have exhibited "a clear weakness in translating intentions into results". 
The reports stop short of recommending sanctions, however. 
Final versions of the documents could undergo minor changes, as three EU commissioners reportedly want to soften the language.

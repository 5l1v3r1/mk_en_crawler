BELGRADE, Serbia -- Justice Minister Snezana Malovic announced on Friday (September 18th) that Italy has agreed to extradite a neo-Nazi leader, who fled Serbia rather than serve jail time.
Goran Davidovic, also known as "Fuhrer", was sentenced in Serbia for inciting national, ethnic and religious hatred in relation to an attack against participants of an anti-Fascist meeting in 2005.
He was sentenced to one year in prison.
Malovic said on Friday that Davidovic will probably be extradited next month.

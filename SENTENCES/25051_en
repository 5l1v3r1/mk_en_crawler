ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday (December 27th) refuted claims of tension between the government and the army. 
The statement came as state prosecutors looking into an alleged assassination plot against Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc raided an army office in Ankara for the second time in as many days. 
The investigation has resulted in the arrest of eight Turkish army officers. 
"Nobody would benefit if it seems that there is a problem between institutions," Erdogan told a business forum Sunday. 
"A whole institution should not be accused of mistakes at some levels. 
Nobody has the right to harm peace in the country through rumours and allegations," he added.

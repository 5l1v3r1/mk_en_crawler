SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Unrest continued in Skopje Thursday (24 October), stemming from the weekend drive-by shooting of a teenager in Tetovo. 
Attacks by ethnic Albanian students against Macedonians reportedly occurred during Wednesday's student protests. 
President Boris Trajkovski is calling for restraint and has asked authorities to undertake immediate measures to prevent outbreaks of ethnic violence.
In other news, stage two of the country's mine-removal programme will begin in Tetovo shortly, according to the press agency Makfax. 
The European Agency for Reconstruction and the European Commission will finance the project in a bid to speed up the return of displaced persons and promote economic growth.

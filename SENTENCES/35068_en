ATHENS, Greece -- Greece and the United States have sealed a deal, which would enable American customs officers to conduct security scans on commercial shipping containers bound for the United States from Greece's largest seaport, Piraeus. 
According to an announcement Friday (25 June) by the US Embassy in Athens, Washington will lend equipment to Greece to screen goods delivered to Olympic venues during the Summer Games in August.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Sunday (December 14th) that Belgrade expects the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to declare Kosovo's independence illegal by 2010.
The UN General Assembly allowed Serbia to address the ICJ on the issue in October.
In an interview with Tanjug, Jeremic said the first hearing will be in April and the second in December.
In the same interview, Jeremic blamed Zagreb for the tense relations between Serbia and Croatia.
Croatia has filed a genocide lawsuit against Serbia at the ICJ, demanding compensation for the human toll and material damage suffered during the 1991-1995 conflicts among the former Yugoslav republics.
"The responsibility of Croatia for the undermining of relations with Serbia is very large," Jeremic said.

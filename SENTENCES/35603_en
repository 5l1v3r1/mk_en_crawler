His comments came during a meeting with regional police directorate heads, called after an incident in Berat, southern Albania, in which a suspect shot two policemen dead.
Toska said police chiefs should take steps to improve officer training.
He warned that Albania is not immune to terrorism attacks, citing information about several suspect associations.

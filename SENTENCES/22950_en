BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn presents the European Commission's (EC) annual reports Wednesday (November 5th) on the progress of Union aspirants in the Western Balkans. 
According to a draft obtained by EU Observer, Croatia may complete its EU accession talks by the end of next year if it manages to fulfil all conditions. 
Serbia might receive the official status of a candidate country in 2009, whereas Macedonia will not receive a date to start EU accession talks. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will face criticism for rhetoric by its politicians that the EC says affects the functioning of institutions and slows reforms.
As for Turkey, the EC will declare the country a functioning market economy for the first time, but will warn Ankara against violating the freedom of press and expression. 
Separately, the Cypriot government is asking the EU to pressure Turkey to help resolve the island's long-standing division. 
Cypriot government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou said that the EU should make Turkey understand it must contribute to ongoing negotiations.

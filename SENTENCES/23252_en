THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU will remain frozen until the UN war crimes tribunal judges Belgrade's co-operation as complete, a Dutch Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
"What matters most is what ICTY chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz will say in his report to the UN Security Council," media reports Friday (May 29th) quoted ministry spokesman Bart Rijs as saying.
Rijs said the Netherlands would consult with UN representatives but is not prepared to lift its opposition to unfreezing the SAA until full co-operation is achieved.
"The best proof of that would be [Ratko] Mladic's arrest," he said.
Earlier, a top US State Department official told a group of Serbian journalists that Belgrade is fulfilling its obligations but must still hand over Mladic, one of the architects of the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
"That is something Serbia has to take care of itself, but we will offer Belgrade any help it needs," US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Stuart Jones was quoted as saying.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to issue an official statement on Monday.

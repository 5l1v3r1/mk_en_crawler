SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Egypt has sent an official note to BiH seeking the extradition of Yusuf Amqad, according to a report Monday (1 September) by BHTV1. 
Authorities arrested Amqad on the Orasje border crossing at the end of last week. 
He is suspected of maintaining links with the terrorist group Al-Jama' al-Islamiyyah, a group Egypt banned years ago.
In other news Monday, High Representative Paddy Ashdown forwarded a legislative framework to the state government and the prime ministers of the two entities on regulating the country's radio and television networks. 
He says the broadcasting system faces a financial crisis due to poor management. 
The new framework is also intended to guarantee editorial independence.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Committee for Protection of Bulgarian Medics presented an initiative Monday (March 19th) to nominate the five nurses jailed in Libya as members of the European Parliament (EP).
The committee is collecting the necessary signatures and says several political parties have expressed a willingness to include the nurses in their lists.
The Central Election Commission, however, notes that Bulgaria's new law on EP elections would bar the nurses from participating in any capacity.
The law requires residency in Bulgaria during the past three months, while the nurses have spent the last eight years in a Libyan prison.
Bulgaria will hold EP elections in May.

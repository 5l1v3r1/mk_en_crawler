ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat was in Ankara on Thursday (April 24th) meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan.
The visit comes only days after Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot ad hoc committees resumed talks on reunifying the divided island, the first such talks in four years.
Talat and the Turkish leaders reportedly discussed negotiating strategies and agreed to seek broader UN involvement in the process.
Talat plans to meet with Greek Cypriot President Dimitris Christofias in June to review the results of the ongoing committee work and to formally launch reunification talks.

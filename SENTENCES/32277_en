ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Tuesday (5 November) that his government has received a request from the UN war crimes tribunal to interrogate three members of the military in connection with crimes committed during the 1991-1995 conflict. 
Racan would identify just one of the suspects, retired Gen Davor Domazet. 
He has said he will co-operate. 
Racan said his government would support the three as it has retired Gen Janko Bobetko.
As for Bobetko, Racan confirmed Tuesday that the government will honour the ruling by the tribunal's Appeals Chamber on depositions related to the indictment. 
To do otherwise would affect Croatia's standing in the international community, he said.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament has launched an inquiry into official reports that a gendarmerie sergeant was involved in the bombing of a bookstore in the town of Semdinli last week, the speaker of the house said Sunday (13 November). 
Bulent Arinc said the incident might have been aimed at turning the people against their own government. 
He promised that any military personnel engaged in terrorist activities would be punished severely. 
A court on Saturday indicted a gendarmerie sergeant and a member of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party for the attack. 
Both men have pleaded innocent.

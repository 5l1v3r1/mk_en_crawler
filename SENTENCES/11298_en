PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova resigned from the post of Democratic League of Kosovo chairman Wednesday (23 February). 
Western diplomats reportedly have insisted on Rugova's withdrawal from one of the two posts, saying such a move would be in line with the democratisation of Kosovo. 
No successor in the party has been named.
In other news, members of the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo (DPK) walked out of the parliament session Wednesday after their request for a debate on the government's decentralisation plan was rejected. 
DPK claims the reforms to local government are based on the principles of ethnic division. 
Kosovo Serb leaders have also rejected the plan.

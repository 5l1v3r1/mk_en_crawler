SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Sarajevo Cantonal Court on Monday (9 February) sentenced Bosnian Serb Ratko Gasovic to ten years in prison for war crimes against Bosnian women.
Gasovic was convicted of raping and maltreating two sisters in the Sarajevo suburb of Hadzici in 1992, after the area fell to the Bosnian Serb military.
He was detained in Sarajevo last January.

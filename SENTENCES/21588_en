ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities decided on Thursday (November 27th) to establish special courts that will begin hearing cases involving corruption and organised crime in January.
Branko Hrvatin, chairman of the Supreme Court, said special departments tasked with handling cases involving organised crime will be set up in county courts in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka and Split.
The move follows a series of brutal mafia-style murders in Zagreb recently, including the killing of a prominent journalist and the daughter of a prominent lawyer.

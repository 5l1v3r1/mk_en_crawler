BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Tuesday (June 8th) in Banja Luka that Belgrade respects the Dayton Peace Accord and supports BiH's territorial integrity.
He was attending a session of the Serbia-Republika Srpska (RS) Co-operation Council, along with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, RS President Rajko Kuzmanovic and RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
Tadic added that while there is no alternative to EU membership, recognition of Kosovo's independence cannot be a condition for it.
Dodik reiterated that BiH will never recognise Kosovo, as RS representatives will not agree to it.
Cvetkovic said that Belgrade plans to invest in infrastructure projects as well as in RS's energy, transport and commercial sectors.

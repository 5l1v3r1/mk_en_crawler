NEW YORK, United States -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said during a visit to New York on Friday (August 28th) that authorities in Pristina are preparing a powerful diplomatic offensive.
According to him, the move, ahead of a discussion of the legitimacy of Kosovo's independence declaration by The Hague-based International Court of Justice on December 1st, is aimed at boosting the number of countries that recognise the former Serbian province.
The UN decided last October to accept Serbia's request to seek the court's opinion on the matter.

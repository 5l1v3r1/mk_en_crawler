SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov says the scandal implicating him as a collaborator to the former secret police, is the byproduct of strife within the ruling coalition. 
At a press conference on Sunday (August 12th), Parvanov said the accusations are "friendly fire" and again denied that he had collaborated with the security services. 
He also denied that he had tampered with his personal file, as suspected by some members of the Commission for Opening the Files of the former Communist Secret Police. 
Any findings by the commission are purely informative, as there are no legal restrictions on former collaborators holding public office.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH Court confirmed on Monday (17 July) that an indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity has been filed against Momcilo Mandic, a businessman and former Republika Srpska (RS) justice and interior minister. 
BiH prosecutors filed the new charges -- which relate to April 1992 attacks on Sarajevo civilians and his role in overseeing RS prison camps -- earlier this month. 
He already faces charges of organised crime and embezzlement.

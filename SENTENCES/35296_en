NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The newly elected leader of Greece's PASOK party, George Papandreou, visited Cyprus on Tuesday (17 February) and said resolving the dispute over the island before 1 May -- the date when the Greek part of the island is set to join the EU -- is feasible.
Papandreou also proposed that in honour of the constructive dialogue currently under way between the Greek and Turkish parts of the island, the Olympic flame should pass through the whole island, not just the Greek part, as initially planned.

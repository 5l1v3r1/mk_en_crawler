ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis admitted Thursday (6 February) that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has pressured Greek and Turkish officials to wrap up security issues related to Cyprus as soon as possible.
The UN has set a 28 February deadline for a settlement of issues related to the divided island.
Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots have rejected each other's proposed amendments to the UN peace plan.
Simitis stressed that Greece is committed to reaching a compromise, adding that his government is ready to support UN Special Envoy to Cyprus Alvaro de Soto in negotiations with the Turkish side.
One key issue:
the number of Turkish troops that are to remain on the island.

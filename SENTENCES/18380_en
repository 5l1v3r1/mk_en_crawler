NEW YORK, United States -- UN Security Council members met on Thursday (May 10th) to discuss a report by Belgian Ambassador Johan Verbeke, regarding a Security Council fact-finding mission to Pristina and Belgrade late last month. 
In general, Verbeke described the situation in Kosovo as stable but fragile. 
He stressed that Kosovo Albanians are confident about the outcome of the status process, while the Serb minority remains very concerned.
Though Council members agree on the need to end the status quo in the province, they are presenting contradictory proposals. 
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin suggests the continuation of talks between Pristina and Belgrade, while US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad says that UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan is the most viable solution. 
The United States and key European nations will submit a draft resolution Friday to the Security Council stipulating internationally supervised independence for Kosovo.

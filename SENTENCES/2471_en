Poverty rates in Macedonia jumped from 24.6 per cent in 2001 to 29.6 per cent in 2004, according to figures from the National Statistics Office.
The number of people considered poor stands at over 600,000 -- an increase of about 120,000 over the past four years.
The figure for 2004 represents a slight decline from 2002 and 2003, when the rate was 30.2 per cent.
But it also shows that, so far, Macedonia has been unable to significantly reverse the longer-term trend towards rising poverty.
Households with dependent children are the most vulnerable, accounting for 35.1 per cent of Macedonia's poor.
The total index of poverty for families with children under the age of two is 36.5 per cent, whereas with families of six or more members, the rate rises to 42.5 per cent.
The lowest index (16.5 per cent) is for two-member families.
Other polls and surveys have shown unemployed people at the top of the poverty scale, with 39 per cent jobless.
The educational level of the head of the family is a key factor.
The highest poverty rate, 57 per cent, is evident among uneducated people and the lowest (9.1 per cent) among people with higher education.
As for how Macedonian citizens live compared to a year earlier, a recent poll found that only 0.3 per cent of interviewees considered themselves to be better off now.
Another 45.7 per cent said they were at the same level, and 19.3 per cent said they are worse off.
Most interviewees, 27.9 per cent, said they need around 500 euros per month to live a normal life.
Under the EUROSTAT definition, the poor include those people, families and groups whose material, cultural and social well-being are below the minimum lifestyle of their country.
World standards put the global poverty threshold at around $2.50 per person per day.
At the recommendation of the World Bank and the IMF, the Macedonian government formed a special team in 2002 to draw up a strategy for reducing poverty in the country.
The strategy has now been incorporated in a report for Macedonia on the millennium development objectives.
The top priority of this strategy is decreasing unemployment rates and elevating education levels among the poor.
The government's economic programme has also emphasised job creation as an instrument for poverty reduction.
The programme anticipates a decline in the number of jobless people by 60,000 people over the next year.

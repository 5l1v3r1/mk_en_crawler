BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutor-General Laura Codruta Kovesi and the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) on Thursday (July 23rd) requested that former Youth and Sports Minister Monica Iacob Ridzi lose her immunity, which would clear the way for a criminal investigation against her. 
During her six months in office, Ridzi allegedly signed three contracts involving public money, then worked to hide the fact she did not follow public procurement regulations. 
Fellow parliament members will have to vote to lift Ridzi's immunity.
In other news Thursday, the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party called for the establishment of a parliamentary panel to investigate Tourism Minister Elena Udrea. 
They say she spent about 3m euros in public funds to promote tourism without achieving any results.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Tuesday (November 23rd) that there can be no normalisation in Greek-Turkish ties unless the Cypriot issue is settled, adding that resolving the issue is a foreign policy priority.
Papandreou's comment followed a meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias in Athens.
Christofias said Cyprus is ready to settle the issue, but insisted Turkey should demonstrate the same readiness.
He stressed Greece's role in the process, pointing out that without Athens' support, Cyprus could have never joined the EU.

ATHENS, Greece -- The government decided on Monday (13 September) to appoint Major General Giorgos Avlonitis as the new head of the Air Force General Staff.
He replaces Panayotis Papanikolaou, who was asked to resign following the weekend helicopter crash that killed Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria Petros VII and 16 other people.
The government cited the delay in launching a search and rescue operation and other problems.
Two committees have been established to investigate the crash, while a three-day period of national mourning was announced Monday.

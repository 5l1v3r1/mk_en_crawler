NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cypriots are voting on in a runoff for their next president on Sunday (February 24th). 
They are choosing between two candidates -- communist leader Demetris Christofias and conservative Ioannis Kasoulides -- who have vowed to resume talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the ethnically divided island. 
The leader of the Turkish community in Cyprus, Mehmet Ali Talat, said northern Cyprus will readily work with either of them to find a solution to the longstanding dispute.

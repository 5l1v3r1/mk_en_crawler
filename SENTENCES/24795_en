NEW YORK, United States -- The trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will begin in late August and will probably last about two years, Patrick Robinson, president of The Hague war crimes tribunal, said on Thursday (June 4th).
Speaking at an open session of the UN Security Council in New York, he added that this will be the last trial unless the two remaining war crimes fugitives -- Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic --- are apprehended.
Robinson noted that if Mladic is arrested soon, he will be tried together with Karadzic.
In other news Thursday, the head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, confirmed the authenticity of part of Mladic's diaries, which were published by the Blic newspaper.
On Wednesday, Blic ran parts of the military and post-military diaries, in which Mladic provided detailed descriptions of meetings with officers from the former Yugoslav army, late President Slobodan Milosevic and the head of the national security service, Jovica Stanisic.
The diary reportedly was seized during a raid on the apartment of Mladic's wife, Bosilka, in early December.

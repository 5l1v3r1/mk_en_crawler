BUCHAREST, Romania -- Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana said Saturday (15 November) that democratisation requires that more attention be paid to social equality and access to basic public services for citizens. 
Speaking at the Regional Conference of the Community of Democracies in Bucharest, Geoana said it was difficult to convince people of the merits of democracy if they experience social inequality. 
He also noted that lack of transparency and corruption are major threats to the process of democratisation. 
Representatives of the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the European Commission attended the conference.

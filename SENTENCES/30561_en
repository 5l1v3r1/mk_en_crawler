TIRANA, Albania -- The tight mayoral race in Tirana remains up for grabs, as the vote count continues. 
With two-thirds of the ballots counted, the Central Election Commission on Tuesday (May 10th) put the incumbent, Socialist Party head Edi Rama, in the lead by only 0.2%, or less than 300 votes over Lulzim Basha of the ruling Democratic Party. 
Voters went to the polls for local elections across Albania on Sunday.

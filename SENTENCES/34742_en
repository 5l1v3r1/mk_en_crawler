ZAGREB, Croatia -- Central Bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski warned on Wednesday (13 August) that foreign debt recently reached nearly $19 billion, or 68 per cent of GDP.
He added that the debt service burden remains at sustainable levels but should not be downplayed, as a relatively large share of the country's income would be spent for interest payments.
Joining him at the news conference was Finance Minister Mato Crkvenac, who emphasised the stock portion of public debt, estimating it at 50.8 per cent of GDP at the end of June.
He said the public debt was not posing liquidity risks for the government and was well within EU requirements.
The two officials added that they are wrapping up a joint financial and monetary report in response to questions from the European Commission.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader starts a visit to Belgrade on Monday (15 November), the first by a Croatian leader to Serbia-Montenegro since the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
The main item on the agenda is the signing of an agreement on the protection of minorities.
In an interview published Sunday, Sanader described the agreement as historic, adding that the sensitive issues of missing persons and refugee return would also be discussed.
He said the visit would significantly boost relations between the two countries.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb police head Stojan Zupljanin requested on Wednesday (December 3rd) that his war crimes trial be merged with that of his close ally, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
In a motion to The Hague war crimes tribunal, Zupljanin argued that as some charges against him overlap with allegations against Karadzic, merging the two trials would save the court time and prevent witnesses from testifying twice. 
Zupljanin is charged with 12 murders, persecution and torturing Muslims in 1992. 
Initially, he faced charges of genocide, but the court later dropped those charges. 
Serbian police arrested Karadzic in July. 
He faces charges of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-1995 war and murdering civilians living in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in 1995.
In other news Wednesday, police in Sarajevo arrested Karadzic's suspected "sponsor", Zeljko Radovanovic. 
He allegedly led one of the biggest local crime groups, whose main activity is illegal drugs. 
Last year, police raided his house and found a sizable cache of drugs and about 200,000 euros that they believe were to fund Karadzic's fugitive status.

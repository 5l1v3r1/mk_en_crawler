TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama said on Tuesday (March 1st) that his party will not boycott the May 8th local elections, but they have some requests aimed at securing a free and fair process. 
The current political situation does not provide for normal elections, according to Rama, who says the opposition wants to avoid a situation similar to the elections in 2009, which first led to the ongoing stalemate. 
He did not rule out anti-government street protests. 
Rama is wrapping up his third term as mayor of Tirana and has not yet announced whether he run again in May.

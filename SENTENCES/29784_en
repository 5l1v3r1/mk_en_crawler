PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Minister of European Integration Vlora Citaku said on Monday (May 23rd) that the European Commission (EC) is applying double standards against Kosovo, referring to requirements Pristina has to meet even before visa liberalisation dialogue begins.
The EC has imposed no such conditions on any other country in the region, Citaku says.
During a visit to Kosovo last week, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said that visa liberalisation criteria have not been met and that the dialogue will not start without progress in reintegration policies and without solving concerns related to illegal immigration.
Pristina missed a summer 2010 target to receive guidelines on the visa liberalisation process.

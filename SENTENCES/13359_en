SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A top banker, Emil Kyulev, head of the leading financial group DZI, was shot dead on a central boulevard in Sofia Wednesday morning (26 October), the latest in a series of daring daylight contract killings. 
Kyulev was named one of the 100 richest businessmen in Central and Eastern Europe by the Polish magazine Wprost earlier this year. 
His murder occurred just a day after the latest European Commission report on Bulgaria cited continued problems with organised crime and corruption.

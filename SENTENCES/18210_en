TIRANA, Albania -- Albanians headed to the polls Sunday (February 18th) electing mayors and municipal councillors, in a vote seen as a key test of the country's political maturity and progress for Euro-Atlantic integration.
More than 4,500 foreign and domestic observers are monitoring the election process, amid tight security.
The elections were postponed once due to a crisis between the ruling and opposition parties and a boycott by the opposition.
The campaign was further marred by isolated violence and the publishing of old nude photos of opposition Socialist Party leader Edi Rama, who is seeking a third term as Tirana mayor.
In separate statements, President Alfred Moisiu, European Commission Ambassador to Tirana Helmuth Lohan and US Ambassador Marcie Ries have called for free and fair elections.

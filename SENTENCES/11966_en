TIRANA, Albania -- Given the largely free and fair general elections earlier this month, Albania has removed a critical barrier to the conclusion of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Tuesday (12 July). 
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, he noted there are more areas in which progress is expected, but stressed the 3 July elections boosted Albania's EU integration bid.
In other news, Jozefina Topalli, deputy chairwoman of the Democratic Party (DP) confirmed on Tuesday that the DP -- the likely election winner -- would approach former allies of the Socialist Party, seeking co-operation. 
The allies would include the Union for Human Rights Party, the Party for Social Democracy and the Agrarian Environmentalist Party.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia faces the distinct possibility of calling a new general election, since the process of forming a new cabinet has stalled after just one round of talks.
International media reported on Friday (February 23rd) that the Democratic Party, which took more seats than any other member of the reformist camp, has failed to strike a deal with outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia on regarding who should be appointed head of the next cabinet.
The talks were suspended after an initial round of consultations with President Boris Tadic.
Under the Serbian Constitution, a new election must be held if a government is not sworn in within 90 days of the assembly's inaugural session.
The deadline expires in mid-May.

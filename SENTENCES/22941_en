ANKARA, Turkey -- Police on Tuesday (November 4th) arrested two pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) officials for allegedly organising an illegal anti-government demonstration. 
The chairman of the party's Istanbul office, Halil Aksoy, and another official were arrested after undergoing questioning in connection with a would-be protest Sunday in Istanbul. 
Police prevented it by firing tear gas at a group of around 60 people who gathered in central Taksim Square to support Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.
In other news Tuesday, DTP leader Ahmet Turk criticised Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for fuelling tensions in the country's south-eastern regions, where violent pro-Kurdish protests erupted recently. 
On Monday, Erdogan accused the DTP of raising tensions.
Also Tuesday, Somali pirates who hijacked a Turkish freighter and its crew a week ago are now demanding a ransom. 
Authorities are not disclosing the specific amount. 
The ship was carrying iron from Canada to China.

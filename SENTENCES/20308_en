SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The leader of the Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development party, Boyko Borisov, submitted an official request on Monday (August 13th) to run for a second mandate as Sofia's mayor. 
Local elections are slated for October 28th. 
Borisov is popular in Bulgaria, and hopes to receive support from rightist parties, as well as the nationalist party VMRO.
Meanwhile, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) is suggesting a common ruling coalition candidate who could compete with Borisov. 
MRF leader Ahmed Dogan said the candidate could come from any party. 
He suggested Milen Velchev, deputy chairman of National Movement for Stability and Progress, as a possible choice.(bTV, Sega, BTA - 14/08/07; Focus, Darik, Mediapool, BNT - 13/08/07)

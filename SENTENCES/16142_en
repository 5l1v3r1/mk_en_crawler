NEW YORK, United States -- Chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte says Belgrade's failure to arrest Ratko Mladic is due to fear of political repercussions in Serbia, Time magazine reported on Sunday (13 August).
She said a UN team had tracked down the Bosnian Serb fugitive three times at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006, but the Serbian government failed to act on the information.
Instead of arresting Mladic, authorities had sent a message to him, urging him to surrender.
She noted that her job would not be done until both Mladic and his political chief Radovan Karadzic are brought to The Hague.

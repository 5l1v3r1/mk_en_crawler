THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- War crimes prosecutor David Re insists that former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj is guilty of war crimes committed when he was a regional commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). 
In closing arguments Monday (January 21st) in the trial against Haradinaj and two other former KLA fighters, the prosecutor stressed there is evidence that Haradinaj approved the rape, persecution and murder of Serb civilians during the 1998-1999 conflict. 
He went on to say that at least 40 Serb civilians were killed in the region controlled by Haradinaj. 
Prosecutors want 25-year prison terms for each of the defendants, all of whom have plead not guilty.

ATHENS, Greece -- The defence ministry announced on Thursday (October 7th) that it is resuming a military exercise with Israel that was postponed after Israel's May raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that left nine Turkish activists dead.
The four-day aerial training manoeuvres begin on Monday around the island of Crete and the western Peloponnese Peninsula.

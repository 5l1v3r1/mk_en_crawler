BERLIN, Germany -- A court in Dusseldorf sentenced two ethnic Turkish men and a woman to prison on Thursday (December 16th) for raising funds in Germany to finance radical left-wing attacks in Turkey. 
The woman, identified only as Nurhan E, 36, got nearly eight years in prison after she was found guilty of heading the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front in Germany, where the Marxist-Leninist organisation has been banned since 1998. 
The two men, identified as Cengiz O, 37, and Ahmet I, 41, were convicted as accomplices in the case and were sentenced to six years and nearly four years respectively.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A new report concludes that the Macedonian government's first 100 days in office show a commitment to implementing reforms needed to guide the country towards sustainable development. 
Issued Monday (31 March) by analysts with the Foundation Open Society Institute, the report praises government policy aimed at fighting organised crime and illegal traffic of drugs, weapons and humans. 
Social and economic policy, on the other hand, is described as incoherent. 
Strategies for raising living standards and reducing poverty are seen as weak.
In other news Monday, parliament passed the law on stimulating employment. 
The government says it will open some 20,000 new workplaces throughout the country.

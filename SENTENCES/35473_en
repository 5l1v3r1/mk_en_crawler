BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Alan Larson, the US undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs, urged the Serbian government Wednesday (11 February) to ensure political and economic stability in the country.
He told Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic and other senior officials that Washington is ready to restore economic ties with Belgrade when stability returns to Serbia.
Larson urged the republic's reformists to form a ruling alliance.
He also said Washington "expects all its partners in the former Yugoslavia to co-operate" with the UN war crimes tribunal.

LIPLJAN, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Serbs warned on Monday (30 January) that they will protest weeks of cuts in electricity supplies to the Serb-populated settlements in central Kosovo.
Local Serb leader Rada Trajkovic says if the issue is not resolved, Serbs will organise a march to Pristina and rally in front of UNMIK headquarters.
Despite bitter cold, he says, Serbs have been left without electricity for more than 20 hours a day.
The power company says the cuts stem from outstanding debts owed by the local population and, more recently, from transmission problems.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Meeting in Belgrade Saturday (7 August), the defence ministers of six Southeast European (SEE) countries -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro -- agreed on the need to develop a new approach to improving regional co-operation.
Such an approach would include joint military exercises, preparation of regional military forces for participation in international peacekeeping missions, and increased collaboration among military intelligence services.
Participants also expressed support for the integration of Serbia-Montenegro into Euro-Atlantic structures.
The SEE defence ministers will again meet in Albania in December.

ANKARA, Turkey -- About one million people took to the streets of Izmir on Sunday (May 13th) to demonstrate their support for the country's secular order. 
The demonstrators, mostly young people, chanted "no to sharia" and carried red Turkish flags and portraits of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic. 
This was the latest in a series of demonstrations in which secularists have voiced opposition to what they see as attempts by the ruling Justice and Development Party to promote an Islamic agenda. 
Opposition parties are trying to use the rallies to gain momentum for the early general election scheduled for July 22nd.
In other news, some 500 renowned Turkish intellectuals issued a declaration Sunday against the army's attempt to interfere in politics prior to the first round of presidential elections in parliament late last month. 
The petition was signed by journalists, academics and artists, all of whom agreed that intellectuals would always oppose any attempt to harm democracy.

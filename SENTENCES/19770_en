TIRANA, Albania -- Lawmakers from the left-wing Socialist Party (SP) stormed out of parliament on Thursday (September 20th) during a speech by former Minister of Public Works, Transport and Telecommunications Lulzim Basha, who explained the circumstances surrounding the bidding process in construction of the highway linking Durres and Kukes, which has lead to corruption charges against nine Albanian officials. 
Opposition MPs said he should have been telling it to prosecutors rather than to them. 
Basha, now the foreign minister, insists everything associated with the project was legal and transparent.

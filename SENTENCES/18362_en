BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer praised the strides made by Macedonia but repeated that serious political dialogue is needed among the government and the ethnic Albanian opposition. 
Meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski on Wednesday (February 14th) in Brussels, de Hoop Scheffer agreed the Balkan country has achieved a lot in terms of fulfilling the requirements for NATO membership. 
However, he added, much work remains to be done, especially in terms of judicial reform, police sector restructuring and combating corruption.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) decided Saturday (January 20th) to launch a bid to impeach President Traian Basescu. 
PSD leader Mircea Geoana says his party expects to have collected the required number of signatures by the end of next week. 
The move followed a controversy involving Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, who last week openly exchanged mutual accusations of corruption, thus further straining ties within the ruling coalition and multiplying expectations for early elections.

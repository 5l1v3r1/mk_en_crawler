ATHENS, Greece -- About 300 migrants ended a nearly six-week hunger strike on Wednesday (March 9th) after the government agreed to delay their deportation procedures. 
The strikers, over 100 of whom were hospitalised during their protest, demanded residential permits. 
Under the deal they struck, their deportation orders will be suspended, suspensions renewable every six months after a review. 
They will also be allowed to work legally in Greece and to visit their home countries.

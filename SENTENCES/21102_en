THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Retired Bosnian Serb General Zdravko Tolimir, who was recently captured and sent to The Hague war crimes tribunal for alleged involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, refused to attend a court session Wednesday (August 1st) regarding his health, claiming he was "in excellent condition".
When he first appeared in court in June, Tolimir said he had suffered three heart attacks and had lost more than 20kg in a very short period of time.
During Wednesday's session, the judge provided Tolimir the right to request a court session to review his health at any time, and ordered the panel monitoring the general's condition to take all necessary medical measures, including hospitalisation.
Tolimir, 58, an aide to the tribunal's most wanted man, Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, was arrested at the end of May on the border between Serbia and Republika Srpska, prompting the EU to resume suspended talks on closer ties with Serbia.

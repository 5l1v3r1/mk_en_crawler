NEW YORK, United States -- Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper again on Friday (16 September) urged Belgrade to arrest and extradite top indictee Ratko Mladic to The Hague tribunal by the end of this autumn.
Prosper's comment followed a meeting with Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic in New York.
According to the US diplomat, apprehending Mladic would be crucial to the launch of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and to continued US financial assistance to Serbia-Montenegro.
Also Friday, NATO troops raided the home of Bosnian Serb Mladjen Kenjic, a former Mladic bodyguard, suspected of helping him and other indictees elude capture.
Republika Srpska police were notified in advance of the raid in the village of Vojkovici but did not directly participate.

TIRANA, Albania -- A delegation of rapporteurs with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Thursday (November 5th) praised the general elections held in Albania in June. 
Wrapping up their visit, rapporteurs David Wilshire and Jaako Laakso said the opposition has no right to interfere with a court decision upholding the results. 
Members of the opposition Socialist Party (SP) have been insisting on an investigation into the elections process, which they claim was marred by serious violations by the ruling Democratic Party (DP). 
The rapporteurs were in Albania ahead of an assessment they'll write of the country's progress towards EU accession and visa liberalisation, which is due in January 2010.
Separately Thursday, European Parliament member Doris Pack urged the SP to stop its boycott of parliament and return to work there. 
The party has been refusing to attend sessions unless an official investigation is launched into the June 28th elections.

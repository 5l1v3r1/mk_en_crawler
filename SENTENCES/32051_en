BRUSSELS, Belgium - On Tuesday (19 November), the European Council published individual roadmaps for Bulgaria and Romania on its website, indicating support for deadlines set by the candidates to join the EU in 2007 and outlining short-term and medium-term reform targets.
The roadmaps also earmark a gradual increase in pre-accession funds.
Meanwhile, Hans-Gert Poettering, chairman of the largest group in the European Parliament, the European People's Party, says that his faction would not support determining exact accession dates for Bulgaria and Romania at next month's EU meeting in Copenhagen.
He says it is too early for the Union to engage in five-year commitments.
On another note, Croatia on Tuesday requested a detailed timetable for accession to the Union.
Deputy Prime Minister Goran Granic warned that "failure to define a clear attitude towards the pace of Croatia's accession in the EU could result in reduced regional co-operation." (24 Chasa, Vjesnik - 20/11/02;

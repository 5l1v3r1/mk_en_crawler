SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Commemorating Europe's worst massacre since World War II, more than 20,000 people gathered Sunday (11 July) to rebury the remains of some of the more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys killed by Bosnian Serbs nine years ago.
The ceremony at the site of the slaughter memorialised 338 victims whose remains had been exhumed from mass graves and identified.
The green coffins were lowered into graves next to mounds containing the remains of 998 previously identified and reburied victims.
In other news, the Sarajevo Cantonal Court on Friday sentenced a Bosnian Serb, Milorad Rodic, to five years in prison for war crimes.
Rodic was found guilty of crimes committed against non-Serb civilians in the Sarajevo region of Grbavica in 1992 and 1993, including maltreatment and rape.
Rodic had confessed and expressed deep remorse.

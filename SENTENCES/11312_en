ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament voted on Wednesday (23 February) to allow students who were expelled from universities to continue their studies.
Critics of the ruling Justice and Development Party said the amnesty was meant to help women who were thrown out of universities for violating a ban on wearing headscarves in class.
Supporters, however, say the ban remains in place.
The new measure would also apply to thousands of students who were forced to abandon their studies during the recession of 2001.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn presented a plan Monday (17 July) for the EU's future role in Kosovo. 
Drafted at the request of the EU Council of Ministers, the document specifies that the future head of the international civilian presence in Kosovo would also serve as EU Special Representative, and would have authority over law enforcement and security.
Later Monday, the EU foreign ministers endorsed the plan and expressed support for the activities of the UN special envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Martti Ahtisaari, particularly his initiative to organise direct negotiations between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders. 
Ahtisaari says he does not expect that 24 July meeting in Vienna to produce any significant results. 
Rather, it would serve as an opportunity for each side to present its position.

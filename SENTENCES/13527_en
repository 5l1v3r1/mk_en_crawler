ANKARA, Turkey -- The National Security Council (NSC) plans to strengthen the fight against terrorism, Turkish Army Chief of Staff General Hilmi Ozkok announced on Wednesday (24 August), following a meeting Tuesday. 
He said the NSC concluded the most serious problem is the banned Kurdistan People's Party (PKK), which "uses terrorism as a means to reach its goal". 
All elements of society must join forces to resolve the problem, Ozkok said.
In other news Wednesday, authorities in the southeast town of Van reported that police have apprehended a suspected PKK member. 
Officials say Onder Gozcu, 24, was detained in a luxury hotel on the basis of intelligence information. 
He reportedly denies any involvement with terrorism.

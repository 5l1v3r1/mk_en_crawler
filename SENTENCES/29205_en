BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament's (EP) foreign affairs committee briefly discussed on Tuesday (May 4th) a draft resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), submitted by EP member Doris Pack. 
Her fellow members support the country's inclusion in the EU's visa-free regime but stressed the need to amend BiH's Constitution, in light of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded in December that the constitution discriminates against minorities. 
In the resolution, Pack said that BiH is undergoing a period of political stagnation and deteriorating interethnic relations. 
EP members submitted 194 amendments to the resolution. 
Pack is expected to consider them and send a new, compromise version of the document by week's end, for adoption later this month.

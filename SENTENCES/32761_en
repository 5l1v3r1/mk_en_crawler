COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The EU opens its long-awaited enlargement summit late Thursday (12 December) amid pressure from the United States to offer Turkey a firm accession date. 
Most EU leaders back a proposal by Germany and France under which Ankara would start the accession process in 2005. 
But the Turkish government has repeatedly said it would not accept a deal that puts off negotiations beyond May 2004. 
On Wednesday, US President George W Bush phoned French President Jacques Chirac and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, asking them to reconsider their positions. 
Also Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Turkey's place was in the EU. 
His comments signalled a shift from London's earlier position.

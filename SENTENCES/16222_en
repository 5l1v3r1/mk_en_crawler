BUCHAREST, Romania -- Authorities are bracing for a new bout of bird flu next month, the country's chief veterinarian said in an interview Thursday (14 September).
Marian Avram said a new outbreak is possible when migratory birds leave Siberia for warmer climates.
But Romania, he explained, would be much better prepared this year than it was in 2005, when it became the first European country to detect the potentially deadly H5N1 strain of the virus.
Avram said a national campaign has been launched to check the health of poultry and a loan of 30m euros has been negotiated with the World Bank to fund measures against bird flu.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Thousands of people lined the streets of BIH's capital on Saturday (8 July) to see a convoy carrying the remains of 505 people murdered in Srebrenica in 1995.
The victims, aged between 15 and 78, have been identified using DNA analysis.
Their bodies were discovered in mass graves in the area and are due to be buried at the memorial cemetery near Srebrenica on Tuesday.
On Sunday, some 1,000 people marched to Srebrenica to remember the victims of the massacre.
Thousands of people and officials, including UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, are expected to gather for Tuesday's ceremony.
In other news, the BiH Constitutional Court rejected on Saturday a request by Borislav Paravac, Serb member of the BiH presidency.
He had sought a public processing of his appeal regarding the legality of BiH's genocide claim against the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the International Court of Justice.
The court officially opened proceedings into the BiH genocide case against Serbia-Montenegro, as successor of the former Yugoslavia, in May.
No new developments have been reported since the split between Serbia and Montenegro.

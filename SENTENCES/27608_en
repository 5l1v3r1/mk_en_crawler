ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor announced on Monday (June 28th) plans for a budget revision in the near term that would require an unusual summer parliamentary session.
The announcement was made following a meeting of the senior ruling Croatian Democratic Union, at which the party debated planned changes in the 2010 budget.
Kosor said the revision is needed to raise funds for a referendum requested by trade unions on proposed labour legislation amendments and to compensate farmers hard hit by recent flooding.

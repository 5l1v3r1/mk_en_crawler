SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The population reportedly shrank by a whopping 8% or about 600,000 people during the last ten years to reach 7.3 million in early 2011, local media reported on Monday (February 28th), citing preliminary data from a just-ended national census.
According to this initial data, Sofia was the only city in which the population grew.
Experts predict a similar trend in the Black Sea coastal city of Varna.
The Bulgarian Statistical Institute will announce official results in late March or early April.

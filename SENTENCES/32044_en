THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (17 October) sentenced a Bosnian Serb to five years in prison on each of two counts of torture. 
The judges decided to let the two terms run concurrently and to deduct the 835 days Milan Simic had already spent in detention. 
After he pleaded guilty to those counts, prosecutors dropped other charges against him, including five counts of crimes against humanity. 
Simic served as an official at the municipality of Bosanski Samac and was originally indicted with leading a campaign of terror aimed at expelling the local Muslim and Croat residents.

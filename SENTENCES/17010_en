SKOPJE, Macedonia -- For a second time, parliament failed to reach agreement on a key police bill.
On Monday (October 2nd), Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska tried to convince lawmakers of its importance to Macedonia's EU integration bid.
She stressed that this version incorporated all recommendations made by the previous parliament as well those by the EU.
Despite her appeal, the passage procedure failed again because of opposition from the Democratic Union for Integration party.

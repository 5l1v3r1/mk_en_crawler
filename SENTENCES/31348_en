BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- On Monday (28 April), Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic announced that the United States would most likely unblock frozen financial aid to Serbia in mid-June. 
Parliament recently approved a federal law on war crimes co-operation, which should prompt the US administration to speed up the process. 
Lacklustre co-operation by Belgrade has been a major obstacle in the past.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Experts have identified the victims of the Paulin Dvor war crime, says Savo Strbac, director of the Veritas Information-Documentation Centre.
Investigators from The Hague discovered the bodies of 19 civilians -- 16 of them Serbs -- in Velebit and exhumed them last year.
Strbac said Thursday (19 June) that it took relatives and the Zagreb Institute of Forensic Medicine more than a year to identify them.
Two Croatian Army members have been indicted in the case.

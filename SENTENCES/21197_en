ATHENS, Greece -- NATO and the EU are very important priorities for Skopje, Matthew Nimetz, the UN's special representative for talks on the name dispute between Greece and Macedonia, said in an interview with the Athens-based daily Kathimerini on Sunday (September 30th). 
According to Nimetz, membership in these organisations is key for the whole region. 
"If [the name issue] is resolved, this would facilitate the development of important processes, such as the accession of the whole region into the EU and NATO," Nimetz told the newspaper. 
He added that Macedonia's desire to join NATO can serve as a catalyst to compromise.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Vojislav Kostunica has lost another appeal related to the failed Serbian presidential election. 
On Wednesday (11 December), the Serbian Supreme Court upheld the electoral commission's decision to annul the results due to low voter turnout. 
Kostunica, who won 56 per cent of the vote, argued that artificially inflated voter registration lists would make it impossible to hold a successful election. 
His Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) claims that the names of more than 800,000 nonexistent people are included. 
Dragan Marsicanin, a top DSS aide, vowed to lodge another appeal.
In other news, Belgrade-based B92 radio reported Wednesday that the US government has again strongly criticised Belgrade's war crimes co-operation efforts, stressing that failure to work closely with the UN war crimes tribunal would prevent the normalisation of trade relations between the two countries and might jeopardise US aid to Yugoslavia.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, warned Bosnian Serb authorities on Wednesday (7 January) that their reluctance to deal with war crimes issues would hamper the country's progress towards membership in NATO and the EU. 
"NATO has said very specifically that in order to be able to join the Partnership for Peace programme at the Istanbul summit it will be necessary... 
for the Bosnian Serb authorities to prove that they are actively engaged in co-operation with the UN tribunal," Ashdown told reporters. 
He reiterated his call for the arrest of war crimes suspects, particularly Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
On Thursday meanwhile, the Banja Luka based newspaper <I>Nezavisne novine</I> reported that al-Qaeda was attempting to recruit young men from BiH to fight with radical Islamic groups in Iraq, Afghanistan and Chechnya. 
The newspaper cited Western sources. 
But police authorities told the paper they had no information suggesting any such Bosnian links.

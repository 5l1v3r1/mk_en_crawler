SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The High Judicial Council (HJC) sacked two top prosecutors Wednesday (February 7th), for systematic procedural violations and damaging the justice system's image.
Tseko Yordanov and Angel Iliev had refused to resign after an internal investigation ordered by Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev turned up problems last year.
By law, any request for disciplinary action must be approved by the HJC, which is composed of prosecutors, judges and investigators.
In other news, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev is in London on Thursday, for meetings with senior EBRD officials and to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics.

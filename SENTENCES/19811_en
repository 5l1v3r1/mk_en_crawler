NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat will meet on September 5th to discuss implementation of last year's so-called July 8th Accord, which envisions restarting talks between the two sides of the divided island, regarding minor issues. 
The meeting was arranged on Tuesday (August 21st) by aides and leaders of the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities. 
It will be the first meeting between Papadopoulos and Talat in more than 13 months.
"We must not raise expectations," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Vassilis Palmas said. 
"What we are aiming at is to create preconditions and the right climate to implement the July agreement, which was brokered between the UN and the leaders of the two communities." (CNA, ANA-MPA, Cyprus Mail - 22/08/07)

TOKYO, Japan -- The government officially recognised Kosovo's independence on Tuesday (March 18th), a month after the province broke away from Serbia. 
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said in a statement that Japan hopes Kosovo's independence will contribute to regional stability and that recognition will not harm relations with Serbia.
Separately Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that during his upcoming Middle East tour, he will urge countries in that region against yielding to pressure from non-Arab and non-Islamic states to recognise Kosovo's independence. 
In an interview with the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper on Tuesday, Lavrov warned Kosovo's unilateral decision could prompt secessionist moves worldwide. 
As examples, he cited the recent riots in Tibet and demands for greater autonomy by ethnic Albanians in Macedonia.

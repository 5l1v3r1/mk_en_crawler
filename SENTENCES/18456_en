WASHINGTON, United States -- President George W. Bush praised Montenegro's readiness to participate in the fight against terrorism on Saturday (December 9th), after accepting the credentials Friday of the new Montenegrin ambassador to the United States, Miodrag Vlahovic.
Bush described Montenegro as an important friend and regional partner.
Vlahovic says he assured Bush of Montenegro's determination to join the Euro-Atlantic structures.
In other news, Montenegrin Chief Prosecutor Vesna Medenica said Friday that her country should be exempted from a genocide case filed by Bosnia and Herzegovina at the International Court of Justice at The Hague.
In her argument before the court, Medenica said Montenegro could no longer be considered as the accused party, given its independence from Serbia and Serbia's status as legal successor of the former federal union.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb Parliament held its constituent session on Thursday (28 November) and elected Dragan Kalinic president of the entity. 
He ran unopposed, following the victory of his Serb Democratic Party in last month's elections. 
The 44-year-old economist served as vice president of the entity after the 2000 elections. 
In his inaugural speech, he renewed a pledge from his election campaign to maintain the autonomy of Republika Srpska, warning that any attempt to unite Bosnia and Herzegovina's two entities would be an "adventure with far-reaching consequences." He also said he would submit a nomination for RS Prime Minister-designate within ten days, as required by law. 
Also on Thursday, the Bosnian Serb assembly elected a chairman and two deputy chairmen, a Muslim and a Croat.

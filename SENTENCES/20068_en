ROME, Italy -- A court on Monday (December 17th) sentenced a Romanian woman to 16 years in prison for a murder committed last April.
Doina Matei, 21, was found guilty of stabbing Vanessa Russo, 23, after an argument inside a subway station.
Russo died two days later, causing an uproar in Italy, which was further fueled by another murder allegedly committed by a Romanian immigrant in the summer.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry on Tuesday (November 13th) added Italy to a short list of dangerous tourist destinations that also includes Iran, Mexico and Costa Rica. 
The decision, published in the travel recommendations section on the ministry's website, was made amid rising tension between Romania and Italy, following the murder this month of a woman in Rome, allegedly by a native Romanian of Roma origin. 
The incident sparked retaliations against other Romanians working in Italy.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia closed the chapter on free movement of goods in its EU accession negotiations at an inter-governmental conference in Brussels on Monday (April 19th). 
Eighteen of the 33 negotiation chapters are now closed. 
Three chapters have yet to be opened, but are expected by end June.
In other news Monday, the Slovenian parliament ratified the country's maritime border agreement with neighbouring Croatia. 
Lawmakers from the ruling coalition backed it, while the opposition boycotted the vote, claiming there was not enough time for debate and that the agreement is detrimental to Slovenia. 
Prime Minister Borut Pahor called the ratification a historic step. 
The agreement will now be submitted to a public referendum, expected in June. 
Under the deal, the maritime border dispute will be subject to international arbitration. 
Croatia has already ratified the document.

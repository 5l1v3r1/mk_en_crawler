VIENNA, Austria -- A Bosnian man was arrested on Monday (October 1st) after allegedly trying to sneak a backpack filled with explosives, nails and Islamic literature into the US Embassy in Vienna. 
Police spokeswoman Michaela Raz said the bag set off a metal detector and the man tried to run, but was apprehended not far from the embassy building. 
She described him as a 42-year-old native of BiH who now lives in the province of Lower Austria. 
As explosives experts examined the contents of his rucksack, police roped off the area around the embassy for several hours.

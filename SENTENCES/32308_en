ATHENS, Greece -- During a visit by his Bulgarian counterpart, Simeon Saxe-Coburg, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis reiterated his country's support for Bulgaria's accession to NATO and the EU. 
Simitis was quoted by the Bulgarian media as saying that 2007 should be the date for Bulgaria's EU admission, in light of Sofia's economic growth, stability and decreasing inflation rate. 
Bulgaria hopes to receive an invitation to join NATO at its summit in Prague later this month.

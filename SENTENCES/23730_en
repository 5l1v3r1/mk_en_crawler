ANKARA, Turkey --Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan on Saturday (January 24th) called on the EU to remove political obstacles and accelerate the country's negotiation process. 
"Unfortunately, nearly half of the [negotiation] chapters are blocked due to an artificial link to Cyprus and due to domestic political concerns in some countries," Babacan told a high-level meeting in Ankara on Turkey's EU bid. 
The minister reiterated Ankara's commitment to continuing EU membership process without interruption. 
He said the government has prepared a new national program on the EU accession to boost pro-EU reform drive in the country. 
Turkey began EU membership talks in October 2005, but it has so far opened only ten of the 35 negotiation chapters, in part because of its refusal to open Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot ships and planes.
In other news, a Turkish court brought charges Friday against four military officers detained in an ongoing probe into a secularist group accused of plotting a coup. 
The four were among 26 people, including army and police officers, arrested in simultaneous operations across the country on Thursday. 
Five other suspects taken into custody in the eastern city of Sivas were released Friday without charges after testifying to police. 
A total of 86 alleged members of the Ergenekon group are currently on trial, charged with "forming or being a member of a terrorist organisation".

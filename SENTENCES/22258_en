PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A UN report on developments in Kosovo is expected to give a green light to the deployment of the EU-led EULEX mission across the country by early December.
"I hope that the report will be handed over very soon to the member states," UN spokesman Brandon Varma said on Tuesday (November 18th).
On Monday, US Assistant Secretary of Defence Stewart Jones said a statement by the president of the UN Security Council is not necessary for the EULEX deployment.
Jones, who was in Belgrade on Monday as part of his first official visit to the Balkans, added in an interview with Beta that Belgrade and Pristina have no disagreements about the deployment of EULEX itself but have concerns about the UN's six-point plan for reconfiguring UNMIK.

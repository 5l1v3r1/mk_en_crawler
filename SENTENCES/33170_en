BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The extradition of former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic is not a condition in itself for entering NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, according to a NATO source quoted Wednesday (14 May). 
The unidentified official said NATO is looking for evidence that authorities have done all within their power to apprehend Mladic. 
The source said this message was communicated to Federal Defence Minister Borislav Tadic during his recent visit to Brussels.

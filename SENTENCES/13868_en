ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has suggested that Turkey might lift its restrictions on Cyprus, but stressed that this would not mean recognition of the Greek Cypriot state. 
Gul made this statement upon his return from Finland, where he discussed issues related to Turkey's EU accession talks. 
On Tuesday (18 October), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated that unless Turkey fulfils all obligations -- including parliamentary ratification of an extended customs union protocol with the bloc -- membership talks would be halted. 
Implementing the protocol would require Turkey to open its ports to ships to and from Cyprus as well as its air space to Greek Cypriot planes.

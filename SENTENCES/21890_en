ZAGREB, Croatia -- The military will have its first woman in the rank of general by the end of this government's term, which expires in 2011, says Deputy Prime Minister Djurdja Adlesic. 
She attended a meeting with Defence Minister Branko Vukalic and top military brass, to assess upcoming changes in the military's command personnel. 
Adlesic noted that while women played a significant role in winning Croatia's independence, the low ratio of women in the military is unacceptable. 
They comprise 8% of all command positions in the armed forces, but none are among the 27 generals.

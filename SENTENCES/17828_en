SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An independent study has established that at least 97,000 people died in the Bosnian conflict from 1992 to 1995.
The majority of victims, 64,036 of them, were Bosniaks.
Another 24,905 were Serbs, 7,788 were Croats, and the remainder were from other nationalities.
Releasing the report Thursday (June 21st), the NGO Research and Documentation Centre said the figures could rise by 10,000 as research continues.
Previous estimates have been as high as 300,000, although the most widely accepted figure was 200,000.
Prosecutors at the UN tribunal have put the number at 120,000.
The centre launched its investigation in 2004 with financial help from several sources.

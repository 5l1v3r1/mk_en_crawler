ZAGREB, Croatia -- The determination of Kosovo's future status may be delayed until sometime in 2007, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in an interview with Croatian daily Vjesnik, published on Saturday (November 4th). 
"Considering the referendum, and the fact that they want elections in Serbia, we have to be cautiousâ¦ so that the issue of the final status of Kosovo is not used for pre-electoral purposes," he explained. 
"We may not stick to the deadlines we had originally planned," Annan said, shortly after meeting with UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari.
In other news, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku told reporters that he still hopes the future status would be determined before the end of the year. 
"I am sure that the outcome will be an independent Kosovo with all guarantees for national minorities, with the help of the international community," he said. 
Ceku went on to add that as prime minister, he feels responsible for the wellbeing of Kosovo's Serbs. 
Ceku was in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, for talks with local officials -- a trip that drew criticism from Belgrade officials. 
Serbian President Boris Tadic described it as "unacceptable and unnecessary" as negotiations on the province's future status continue.

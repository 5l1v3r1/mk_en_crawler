NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Dervis Eroglu, the leader of the centre-right National Unity Party in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, announced on Saturday (30 October) that he would not be able to form a new cabinet.
He was given the mandate after the resignation of Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat, but could not forge a coalition with other parties.

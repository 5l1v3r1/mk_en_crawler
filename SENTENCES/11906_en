NEW YORK, United States -- The prevention and effective handling of humanitarian crises requires timely action, Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis said Tuesday (12 July), in a speech to the UN Security Council during a debate on the Union's role in humanitarian crises. 
Unless prompt action is taken, crises can destroy the unity within societies and result in the collapse of the building blocks of a state, Molyviatis warned. 
He cited the Balkans as an example where failure was obvious.

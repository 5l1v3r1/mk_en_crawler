PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The Business Association in Zubin Potok has distributed pamphlets against EULEX, declaring it non grata in the northern municipality.
"EULEX is not working in compliance with its status-neutral stance on Kosovo, thus violating the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 by attempting to present Serbs living in the north as criminals, because they refuse to pay taxes and customs fees to the so-called Republic of Kosovo," according to the text of the pamphlets plastered around town Wednesday (March 9th).

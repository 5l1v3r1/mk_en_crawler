STRASBOURG, France -- Amendments to the report of the foreign affairs commission in the European Parliament recommend that the European Commission adjust its negotiation programme with Romania.
The head of the commission, Emma Thompson, said Wednesday (18 February) that EU authorities should allow more time for Romania to complete negotiations on the policy chapters, in case Bucharest is unable to meet all criteria.
The statement, however, implies that any delay in the timeline for accession talks would not affect the planned entry date, January 2007.

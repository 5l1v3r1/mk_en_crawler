ANKARA, Turkey -- A senior UN official on Thursday (24 February) urged Turkey to better protect human rights as it battles terrorism.
Martin Scheinin, a special UN rapporteur for the protection of human rights in counterterrorism campaigns, was on a weeklong fact-finding mission, visiting prisons in Ankara and Diyarbakir.
He said Turkey's legal definition of terrorism is so broad that it allows prosecution for a variety of other acts, including criticising the government.
In other news, five Kurdish terrorists have been killed in a gun battle near the southeastern city of Mardin, authorities reported on Friday.
The army has been conducting an operation there against the Kurdistan Workers Party.

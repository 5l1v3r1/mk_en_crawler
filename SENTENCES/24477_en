THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague war crimes tribunal announced on Tuesday (April 7th) that its judges denied an appeal by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic for immunity from prosecution, based on a deal he allegedly had with former US envoy Richard Holbrooke.
According to Karadzic, Holbrooke promised him in 1996 that the UN tribunal would leave Karadzic alone if he resigned from power.
Holbrooke has denied the deal.
Separately, Hague prosecutors on Monday requested that indictee Jovica Stanisic be returned to the Netherlands to undergo treatment for mental illness.
The former Serbian state security service chief obtained his release in late June to undergo treatment at the Military Academy in Belgrade.
Prosecutors insist Stanisic is not receiving the care he needs in Belgrade.
He is charged with arming and training militias who committed war crimes against non-Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia.

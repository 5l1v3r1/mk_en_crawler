ZAGREB, Croatia -- The regional court of Zagreb announced on Wednesday (August 11th) it has approved the extradition to Serbia of Srecko Kalinic, a fugitive convicted of the 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djinjic. 
The final say regarding extradition, however, will come from Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic, the court noted. 
Kalinic has three days to appeal the verdict. 
A member of the criminal gang Zemun Clan, Kalinic had been on the run for seven years before his June arrest in Zagreb. 
In 2007, he was found guilty of Djindjic's murder and sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison.

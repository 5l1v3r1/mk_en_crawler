BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU should not freeze its plans to accept the Western Balkan countries as members, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (March 17th) following calls from Germany for an indefinite pause in the enlargement.
Earlier in the day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested the 27-member Union needed a consolidation phase before allowing in new members.
In response, Rehn said the enlargement prospects boosted both political stability and economic reforms.
"We cannot take any sabbatical," Rehn said.
"This is ...
an anchor of stability in Southeastern Europe.
We should not shake this anchor." (AFP, HINA, 24 Sata, HRT - 17/03/09)

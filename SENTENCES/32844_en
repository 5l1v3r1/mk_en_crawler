BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Monday (2 December), the Serbian Election Commission permitted candidates running for president to review the official voter registration list.
The decision came after one candidate, Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, demanded access to the lists to ensure there are no irregularities.
Candidates will be allowed to look at the lists on commission premises, in the presence of commission representatives.
But Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia warned Monday that the potential for double counting remains.

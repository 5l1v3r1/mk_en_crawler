ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat denied on Friday (January 5th) any rift with the Turkish military over plans by authorities in the Turkish-occupied north to dismantle a bridge on Ledra Street in Nicosia and to re-open another crossing between the two divided ethnic communities in the island.
Local media had reported that the Turkish army disagreed with the plans, as the facility is inside a military zone under their control.
Greek Cypriots have long objected to the bridge.

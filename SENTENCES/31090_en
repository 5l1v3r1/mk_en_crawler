ANKARA, Turkey -- Tens of thousands of people gathered in the Aegean city of Izmir on Sunday (March 6th) demanding equal rights for members of the Alevi community. 
The Alevi form of Islam teaches equality between the sexes, allows for alcohol consumption, and claims that God is within everyone. 
According to local media, the protest at Gundoglu Square brought together about 60,000 people. 
They chanted slogans and carried banners, demanding abolishment of mandatory religious lessons and a legal status for their places of worships, the cemevis. 
The protestors also insisted that authorities stop building mosques in Alevi villages.

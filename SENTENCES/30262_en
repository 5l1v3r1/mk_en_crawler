SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The leaders of 12 parties represented in the BiH state-level parliament decided on Monday (January 17th) to meet again in 15 days, the parliament's interim Chairman Adnan Basic said. 
He confirmed a meeting held earlier in the day ended with no breakthroughs. 
Within the next two weeks, the parties are expected to determine alliances giving them the necessary majority for general and entity voting. 
That, in turn, would allow for the constituent session of the BiH lower house to continue. 
Elections were held in early October.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov launched on Thursday (November 11th) his much anticipated project -- the Alternative for Bulgarian Revival (ABV) -- which he says is neither a civic movement nor a political party. 
Under the constitution, the president cannot have party affiliations. 
The majority of local experts, however, believe the ABV will eventually turn into a party. 
Representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), of which Parvanov was a member, were present at the event, though Parvanov insisted that his goal is not to split his former party.
Meanwhile, Volen Siderov, leader of the nationalist Attack party, wants to start an impeachment procedure against Parvanov, arguing that setting up a new party while still in office violates the constitution. 
Krasimir Velchev, co-chairman of the ruling GERB's parliamentary group, says his party will discuss the idea next week. 
GERB attempted to impeach the president earlier this year, but fell short of the required two-thirds in parliament.

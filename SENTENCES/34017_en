SKOPJE, Macedonia -- On Wednesday (30 July), the government approved a plan to downsize the army, defence ministry spokesman Marjan Gjurovski announced.
He said the plan, which envisions the retirement of 661 army staff, would be implemented by the end of 2007.
The first phase, in which 235 people would take pensions, is to be accomplished by the end of this year.
After all the planned reforms are complete, total army staff should number just over 12,850.

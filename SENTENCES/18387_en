BUCHAREST, Romania -- The minority cabinet of Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu survived a no-confidence vote on Monday (June 11th) with help from the main opposition party, the Social Democrats.
The motion was filed by President Traian Basescu's Democratic Party (PD), once a member of the ruling centre-right coalition.
The PD argues the cabinet is no longer legitimate, following last month's failed attempt to impeach Basescu.
Also on Monday, Basescu suspended Communication and IT Minister Zsolt Nagy, who is under investigation for allegedly allowing the leak of classified information and facilitating illegal energy privatisation deals.
Former Economy Minister Codrut Seres is also implicated in the case.
On Tuesday, meanwhile, Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu kicks off a two-day visit to Washington.
He is to meet with US counterpart Condoleezza Rice, among others.

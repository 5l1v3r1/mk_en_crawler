BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Agim Ceku, the leader of the Kosovo Protection Corps, was arrested Sunday (29 February) at the Budapest International Airport as he was trying to board a plane bound for Pristina.
Local authorities cited a Belgrade-requested Interpol arrest warrant for Ceku, accusing him of genocide against the Serb population in Kosovo.
However, Ceku was given to Croatian diplomatic authorities in Budapest after they confirmed he is a Croatian citizen.
Political leaders in Kosovo were quick to condemn the arrest.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova said it was "unacceptable" and insisted Serb warrants were "not valid for the people of Kosovo".
Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi warned Sunday that dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina could not resume until Ceku's release.
He would return to the UN-governed province Monday, reports <I>Koha Ditore</I>.

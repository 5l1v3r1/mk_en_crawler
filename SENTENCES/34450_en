ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis denied rumours Tuesday (14 October) that he is contemplating a government reshuffle.
Addressing PASOK's parliamentary group, he urged members to ignore speculation by both the media and the opposition and work instead to implement the party's strategy to reduce unemployment and bolster EU convergence.
Simitis also asked party members to become more involved in preparations for next spring's general elections.

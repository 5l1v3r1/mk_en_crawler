SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Constitutional Court President Trendafil Ivanovski refuted accusations Monday (September 27th) that he served as an informant for the former Yugoslav secret services. 
Reacting publicly to the findings of the state lustration committee, Ivanovski denied the accusations and described them as an effort to discredit him. 
He also said he does not intend to resign. 
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE says the investigation undermines the credibility of the court's recent decisions. 
The lustration committee was established to prevent former communist-era informants from holding public office.

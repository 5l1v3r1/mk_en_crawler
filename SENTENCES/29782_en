PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Northern Kosovo remains in the hands of illegal Serb parallel structures and there is no rule of law, a new government report concludes. 
The territory north of Mitrovica to the Serbian border lacks a judiciary, while EULEX remains very limited, says a report drafted by the co-ordinator of the strategy for the north, Ylber Hysa, and published by the daily Koha Ditore on Tuesday (May 24th). 
The report describes dangerous hooligan gangs and crime groups that make life difficult. 
Kosovo institutions and the international presence are heavily criticised for tolerating illegal structures operating in the area.

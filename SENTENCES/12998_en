BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian authorities announced Tuesday (31 May) that they have lifted an international warrant for the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, in exchange for a promise from her lawyer that she would attend her trial in Belgrade in September. 
Markovic is wanted in connection with the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic. 
The national warrant for her arrest has not been lifted, however. 
Markovic will now be free to visit her husband in The Hague. 
She disappeared in 2003 and is thought to be hiding in Russia.

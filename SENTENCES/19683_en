ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraq's Sunni Vice-President Tareq al-Hashemi is in Ankara on Friday (August 24th) to discuss Turkey's concerns over terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants in northern Iraq.
Thursday evening, he met with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who told him that Turkey expects Iraq to continue its efforts against terrorism, an apparent reference to bases Ankara says are used to stage cross-border attacks.
For his part, al-Hashemi stressed Turkey's contributions to efforts at achieving political consensus in Iraq and said Baghdad expects that support to continue.
On Friday, he met with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
Afterwards, al-Hashemi told reporters that his party, the National Concord Front, had no immediate plans to return to the splintered Baghdad government.

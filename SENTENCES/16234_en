WASHINGTON, United States -- The economic situation in Macedonia has finally started improving, the IMF board said in a statement Friday (11 August), praising the government's macroeconomic policies over the last couple of years. 
After a decade of sluggish growth, GDP growth reached 4 per cent for two years in a row, inflation was under control and the current account deficit was cut, the board said. 
It cautioned, however, that structural deficiencies remain and that more foreign direct investments are needed. 
The statement followed the IMF's Article IV consultation with Macedonia in late July.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said in a statement Tuesday (18 January) that he was dissatisfied with the talks on Kosovo held in Belgrade the previous day.
He said he was disappointed that Serbian officials refused to discuss anything but power supply cuts in Kosovo Serb settlements.
The UNMIK head said the meetings could have been used to discuss the major issues, such as decentralisation.
Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said Tuesday that he too had expected more from the visit.
According to Haradinaj, the Serbian authorities should have discussed the problem of missing persons in Kosovo.

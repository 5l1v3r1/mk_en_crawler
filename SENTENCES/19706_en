ZAGREB, Croatia -- The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) managed on Wednesday (February 20th) to win two deputy parliament speaker posts.
They went to Zeljka Antunovic and Neven Mimica, after the SDP refused to compromise with the Croatian People's Party (HNS) and split the seats awarded to the two parties.
However, the two seats came at a price -- the SDP lost its influence in the council on EU integration, which is traditionally led by a representative of the opposition.
With the support of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, chairmanship of the council went to HNS leader Vesna Pusic.

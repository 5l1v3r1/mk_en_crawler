THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal will hand down verdicts Monday (17 January) in the cases of two Bosnian Serbs accused in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. 
Vidoje Blagojevic commanded the Bratunac Brigade and was a subordinate of General Radislav Krstic, who was sentenced for leading the charge on the Muslim enclave. 
Dragan Jokic was chief of engineers in the Zvornik Brigade and allegedly played a key role in concealing evidence of the massacre.
In other news, High Representative Paddy Ashdown and European Commission Ambassador to BiH Michael Humphreys issued separate statements Sunday, welcoming the transfer of Savo Todovic by Republika Srpska authorities to The Hague tribunal. 
Todovic was extradited to the tribunal after surrendering Saturday. 
The government in Banja Luka praised Todovic's decision to surrender and called on all other war crimes indictees to follow his example.

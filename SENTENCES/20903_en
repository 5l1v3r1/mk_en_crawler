BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu plans to visit Italy soon for talks with counterpart Romano Prodi, in the wake of tensions sparked by last week's murder of a woman in Rome. 
A Romanian national has been charged with beating her to death. 
In apparent retaliation, a dozen masked men attacked a group of Romanians in a Rome suburb late Friday, injuring one of them seriously. 
Italy has also begun deporting Romanians with criminal records. 
The Romanian government announced Tariceanu's planned trip on Sunday (November 4th).

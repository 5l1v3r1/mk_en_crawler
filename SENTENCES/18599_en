BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said on Sunday (February 11th) that RS would not accept the ruling -- expected later this month -- of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, regarding the genocide case BiH has filed against Serbia and Montenegro. 
He described the lawsuit that BiH initiated in 1993 against the former Yugoslavia as "illegitimate" since the beginning. 
Therefore, RS would neither recognise nor participate in implementing the ICJ decision, even if that would lead to a new international dispute, Dodik said.
BiH is seeking compensation for the loss of life and property during the 1992-1995 conflict, when an estimated 200,000 people were killed and entire Muslim towns and villages were devastated. 
Belgrade rejects the accusations as exaggerated, and questions the ICJ's jurisdiction, saying that the UN suspended membership to then-Yugoslavia before the case was filed.
In other news, RS police searched the office of Radovan Bajic, director of NLB Razvojna Banka, early Monday. 
Bajic is a suspected aide to war crimes fugitive indictee Stojan Zupljanin. 
Following the office search, police moved on to Bajic's house. 
The search was conducted following an order of the BiH Court.

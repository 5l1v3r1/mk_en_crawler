NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council on Friday (May 27th) welcomed the arrest of former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic. 
Member states hailed efforts by Serbian authorities that demonstrated their will to co-operate with The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
French Ambassador Gerard Araud, whose country holds the Council's rotating presidency, welcomed Belgrade's intention to transfer Mladic to The Hague as soon as possible.
On Saturday, Serbia's deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric said the date of that extradition will not be announced for security reasons, adding that Mladic has until Monday to file an appeal against the extradition.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Following several hours of debate, the Macedonian Parliament on Friday (6 August) rejected a request by the opposition to amend parts of the territorial division bill. 
The amendments were aimed at delaying changes to the status of two municipalities -- Struga and Kicevo -- until 2008. 
The ruling coalition denied opposition claims that the bill was based on inappropriate criteria for territorial organisation.

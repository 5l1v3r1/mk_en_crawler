BUCHAREST, Romania -- Adrian Nastase, leader of the ruling Social Democrats, said Thursday (2 December) that his party would not form an alliance with the far right Romania Mare party of Corneliu Vadim Tudor. 
Nastase, who will step down as prime minister if elected president on 12 December, explained that such an alliance would strain relations with the United States and the EU.
In other news, the Financial Times reported Friday that the European Commission has complained to EU member states that Romania is unwilling to adopt the major changes to government subsidy programmes that are needed to meet European standards. 
Romanian authorities are hoping to wrap up negotiations with the EU this year, but the issue could block the signing of an accession agreement in 2005.

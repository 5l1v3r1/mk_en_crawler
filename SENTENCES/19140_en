WASHINGTON, United States -- The EU and the United States said on Monday (April 30th) they would step up efforts to win the release of the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor, sentenced to death in a controversial HIV infection trial in Libya.
Following an EU-US summit in Washington, the White House issued a statement.
It reaffirmed sympathy for the infected children, but also underlined the international community's position â namely, that scientific evidence and testimony exonerates the six medics.

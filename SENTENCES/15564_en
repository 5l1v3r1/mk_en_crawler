TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament endorsed a report Monday (24 July) by an ad-hoc parliamentary commission, investigating alleged legal violations by Chief Prosecutor Theodhori Sollaku. 
The panel confirmed wrongdoings and recommended his dismissal. 
It was also decided that the legislature would recommend Sollaku's successor. 
Local media noted however that only members of the ruling coalition parties approved the report, as opposition members had left the chamber. 
The opposition insists the campaign against Sollaku is purely political.

BERLIN, Germany -- Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, reiterated on Saturday (January 13th) that the Western Balkans must have a European perspective. 
According to a statement widely quoted by the Balkan media, she said the boundaries of EU enlargement have been reached to a large extent and that some states should be told they cannot join. 
But Merkel stressed that the Western Balkan countries must be an exception and they should be given an EU integration perspective due to their importance to peace in the region.

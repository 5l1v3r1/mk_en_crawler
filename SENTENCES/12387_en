BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU leaders have called for establishing a joint panel of state, entity and international security representatives that would work to apprehend fugitive war crimes indictees in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
After a meeting between BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and EU security chief Javier Solana in Brussels on Wednesday (9 February), it was announced an agreement was reached to form such a group as soon as possible. 
Solana also urged the creation of a single police structure in BiH, insisting it is the only way to efficiently fight crime.
In other news, an official in Banja Luka said five candidates have applied for the vacant position of Republika Srpska police director, but none submitted complete documentation. 
They will be given until the end of this week to supply information on their party affiliations.

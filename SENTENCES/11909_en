LONDON, Britain -- The EU has made it clear to Croatia that it would not be able to start accession talks if fugitive General Ante Gotovina is not arrested and transferred to UN tribunal in The Hague by 17 March, the Financial Times reported Wednesday (16 February). 
France and Germany, Zagreb's staunchest backers, have now joined the position of other governments concerning the issue. 
The two countries had so far avoided naming Gotovina's arrest as a condition for launching negotiations.
On Tuesday meanwhile, UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte reiterated her claim that a network of high-ranking Croatian officials is helping Gotovina escape justice. 
Del Ponte again suggested that the administration in Zagreb is ambivalent about Gotovina. 
Croatian officials insist they are doing everything possible to locate him.

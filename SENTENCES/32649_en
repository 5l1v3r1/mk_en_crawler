ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament on Wednesday (25 December) extended the mandate allowing US aircraft to use Incirlik airbase to patrol the no-fly zone over northern Iraq. 
Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis told lawmakers that this was appropriate, given the uncertainties in the region. 
He also expressed hope that the UN would resolve difficulties with Baghdad. 
Also Wednesday, the government met to discuss Ankara's participation in a possible war against Iraq. 
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey could not just stand back and watch if tensions escalated next door. 
A meeting of the National Security Council, which includes top military officers, is expected before the end of the week.

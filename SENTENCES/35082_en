BRUSSELS, Belgium -- President of the European Parliament (EP) Pat Cox said Wednesday (25 February) that Romania still has a good chance of joining the EU in 2007 but should take quick action to meet the recommendations of the EP's Foreign Affairs Committee.
Cox said the panel's recently drafted report should serve as a "wake-up call" to Romania.
Prime Minister Adrian Nastase met Cox, European Commission President Romano Prodi and Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen in Brussels to discuss reform issues.

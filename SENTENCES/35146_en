BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy met on Monday (23 February) with EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen. 
The two discussed the recently released EC financial framework for Bulgaria and Romania and the countries' progress towards integration. 
Passy said the financial package was intended to speed up negotiations on the agriculture, regional policy and budget chapters of the accession talks. 
He added that the country expects to learn the EC common stance on the remaining chapters in the spring, in order to conclude talks by the end of the year.

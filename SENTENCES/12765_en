WASHINGTON, United States -- The World Bank announced late Thursday (2 June) that its board has endorsed the Third Programmatic Adjustment Loan for Bulgaria.
The credit is the last in a series aimed at supporting structural reforms in the country.
It has a 17-year maturity and a 5-year grace period.
However, the Bank also warned about the progress of structural reforms, particularly judicial reforms, reduction of corruption, and improvement of the business climate.
It called on Bulgarian authorities to intensify efforts to restructure vital areas -- such as education and administration quality -- and to expand infrastructure investment.
In other news, USAID reportedly may finance a second project to boost the judicial system.
According to local press reports Saturday, the agency would extend $500,000 to finance several small-scale projects by NGOs.

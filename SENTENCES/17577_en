BUCHAREST, Romania -- Interior Minister Vasile Blaga and Hungarian Ambassador to Romania Janos Terenyi signed a bilateral agreement Thursday (December 21st) introducing an integrated "one-stop" control system at the common border as of January 1st.
Under the accord, travellers crossing to Romania from Hungary at seven checkpoints will be checked by Romanian border guards, whereas travelers entering Hungary from Romania at three other crossings will be checked once on the Hungarian side.
Blaga said a similar system on the Romanian-Bulgarian border has contributed to a 70% reduction in wait time.

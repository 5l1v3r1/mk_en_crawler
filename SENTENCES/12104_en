BRUSSELS, Belgium -- General James Jones, the top NATO and US commander in Europe, told reporters Tuesday (12 April) that the Alliance is considering measures that would create a leaner, but more efficient, KFOR.
He said too many troops in Kosovo are engaged in logistics and other jobs with little impact on the success of the operation.
The new measures proposed by KFOR Commander Yves de Kermabon apparently focus on greater mobility and flexibility as opposed to numbers.
NATO presently has 17,100 troops in the UN-administered province.

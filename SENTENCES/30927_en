BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) voiced disappointment and concern on Wednesday (December 8th) over Serbia's decision not to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo honouring Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. 
Angela Filote -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele's spokesperson -- said that the EC is in contact with Serbian authorities and voiced hope that they will send a representative to the ceremony. 
She added that the 27 EU member states have already agreed on a common position and Serbia is expected to act in unison with the bloc.
Chinese Ambassador to Belgrade Wei Jinghua said that his country appreciates Serbia's decision. 
Belgrade opted to side with China's traditional allies, including Venezuela, Cuba, Kazakhstan and Iran (Tanjug, B92, RTS, Beta, Reuters - 08/12/10)

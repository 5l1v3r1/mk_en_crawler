ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's chief negotiator with the EU, State Minister Ali Babacan, said on Tuesday (February 20th) that Ankara hopes to open talks on a minimum of four negotiation chapters with the EU by July. 
Last December, the EU decided to freeze talks on eight of the 35 negotiation chapters, after Ankara refused to open its air and naval space to Greek Cypriot traffic. 
Babacan visited Brussels last week and briefed Parliament members on it Tuesday.
Also Tuesday, local media reports suggested that at Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's request, the ruling Justice and Development Party was reviewing suggestions by Turkish NGOs for amending Article 301 of the penal code. 
The EU repeatedly has criticised the controversial provision, which makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness".

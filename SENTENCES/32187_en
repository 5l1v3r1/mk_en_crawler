TIRANA, Albania -- On Sunday (10 November), Parliamentary Investigation Commission Chairman Spartak Ngjela, along with opposition members, left Albania's Investigation Commission. 
The move occurred during heated debates with members from the Socialist Party, who presented a draft report that Ngjela considers defensive of the state intelligence agency's anti-opposition activities and of its former director, Fatos Klosi. 
He insisted that the opposition's report also be presented. 
Socialist members responded that by law, the commission must come up with one report. 
After Ngjela walked out, the Socialist members approved the draft report, which is to be presented to parliament for discussion Monday.

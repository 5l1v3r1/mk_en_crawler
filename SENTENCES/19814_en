NICOSIA, Cyprus -- US Ambassador to Cyprus Ronald Schlicher said on Thursday (December 20th) it is time for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to start implementing an agreement signed in July 2006.
The accord stipulates the start of two-tier negotiations on substantial and practical day-to-day issues as a first step towards the eventual revival of reunification talks.
The ambassador said the United States and the entire international community support the resumption of talks.
Schlicher also hinted that the UN is working on a new initiative to resolve the Cyprus issue, which would be unveiled after presidential elections in the Greek part of the island in February.

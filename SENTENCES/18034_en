SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- An international community task force will convene and draft proposals regarding Srebrenica's status within two weeks, according to an announcement Saturday (April 14th).
Officials representing the international community, BiH and Republika Srpska (RS) met in Srebrenica earlier in the day, in response to plans by Bosniak returnees to move out of the RS municipality en masse and seek special status, outside of RS jurisdiction.
This followed the International Court of Justice's recent acknowledgement that genocide was committed there in July 1995.
Visiting Srebrenica on Saturday, Principal Deputy High Representative Raffi Gregorian urged the Bosniaks to remain in Srebrenica, saying that steps would be taken to improve living conditions there.

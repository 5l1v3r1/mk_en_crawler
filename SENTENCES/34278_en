SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR announced on Tuesday (1 July) that its troops discovered an illegal military training camp in the Muslim-Croat entity.
The peacekeepers said in a statement that "a large quantity of ammunition, military uniforms, targets with holes, field telephones and other military equipment" has been confiscated.
SFOR added that the find "indicates that some illegal combat trainings were taking place in the region." The statement said the discovery came during an operation lasting several days.
On Wednesday, SFOR personnel and local authorities will begin destroying several thousand damaged surface-to-air missiles at the Republika Srpska Army garrison in Derventa.
An explosion there on 20 June killed two people and damaged the missiles.

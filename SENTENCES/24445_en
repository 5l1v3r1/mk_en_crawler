BUCHAREST, Romania - President Traian Basescu urged Romanian politicians on Monday (March 9th) to show "solidarity and responsibility" and support austerity measures to soften the impact of the global economic crisis. 
In an address to parliament, Basescu stated he favoured an arrangement with the IMF, saying a foreign loan was the only way to rescue the country's economy. 
"Romania needs a safety belt that means external borrowing. 
The country can receive money from the EU, but the condition that the EU imposes is a partnership with the IMF," Basescu said. 
In his speech, the president blamed the former cabinet for the current situation, saying it stemmed from budgetary mismanagement despite solid GDP growth over the past few years.
In a press release issued after Basescu's address, the IMF announced that its upcoming mission to Bucharest would discuss a possible technical programme for Romania that might include a multilateral financing package, supported by the EU, the World Bank and other financial institutions.

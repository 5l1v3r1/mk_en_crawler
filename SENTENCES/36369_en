LONDON, United Kingdom -- Immigration Minister Des Browne issued a statement Wednesday (19 May) announcing the resumption of issuing employment-related and other visas to Bulgarian and Romanian nationals.
He said an investigation has confirmed that these visas were not subject to "widespread abuse".
The British government will adopt a series of measures to guarantee that visas are issued only to eligible candidates.
The government had come under heavy criticism from the agricultural sector, which relies heavily on temporary workers from abroad.

TIRANA, Albania -- A project aimed at strengthening border control and the fight against illegal trafficking and organised crime was launched in Albania Wednesday (27 April). 
Promoted by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and financed by the Italian Anti-drugs Fund, the project will help authorities boost professional and technical capacity for finding illegal drugs and uncovering other trafficking activities at the Morine, Bllata, Qafe Thana and Kapshtica checkpoints. 
It also will support the exchange of intelligence information at the regional level.

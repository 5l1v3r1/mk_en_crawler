BELGRADE, Serbia -- The foreign ministry said Thursday (August 23rd) that it has received an official invitation to the troika meeting on Kosovo's final status in Vienna next week.
That clears the way for Belgrade to choose members of its negotiating team.
Kosovo and Metohija Minister Slobodan Samardzic had expressed concerns about the lack of an invitation -- and information about specific topics -- on Wednesday.
Portugal's Foreign Minister Luis Amado, current holder of the rotating EU chairmanship, visited Belgrade on Wednesday.
He assured Samardzic that the EU would make every effort to support negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina so common ground can be reached.
From Belgrade, he travelled to Pristina, where he met with UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker, KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather, President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Ceku.
Amado called on the 27 EU member states to remain unified regarding Kosovo, for the sake of stability in the Balkans.

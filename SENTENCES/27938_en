NICOSIA, Cyprus -- A key suspect in the murder trial of media mogul Andis Hadjicostis was remanded to five days in custody Friday (August 20th) by a court in Nicosia. 
Gregoris Xenofontos, 29, has been in custody to assist the investigation since his extradition from Moldova on Wednesday. 
Investigators say he pulled the trigger in the January 11th killing of Hadjicostis. 
TV host Elena Skordelli, her brother Anastasios Krasopoullis and co-defendant Andreas Grigoriou are already on trial for plotting the killing, allegedly prompted by Skordelli's dismissal from a TV station Hadjicostis owned.

STRASBOURG, France -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele told the European Parliament (EP) on Tuesday (February 15th) that Albania must meet requirements set by the European Commission if it wants to continue its EU integration process.
During a special discussion on Albania, Fuele urged EP members to assist Albanian colleagues in understanding their obligations.
He stressed that Tirana must investigate the violent January 21st protests without political interference;
establish communication and dialogue to resolve the political stalemate, and prepare for the May local elections.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- There will be changes in the current government in the near future, Parliament Speaker Ognyn Gerdjikov said in an interview for Nova Television on Saturday (14 June).
The halfway point of its term in office is a suitable time for the ruling majority to reorganise, Gerdjikov said.
He added that only six of the ministers are doing a good job.
He urged the others to work harder, especially Economy Minister Nikolay Vasilev.

WASHINGTON, United States -- On Thursday (29 May), President George W Bush formally removed the orders which served as grounds for imposing sanctions against the former Yugoslavia 11 years ago. 
He cited "the strong commitment to political and economic reform" shown by senior government officials. 
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said a new executive order has been issued, listing 172 persons and organisations who would continue to be subject to restrictions. 
They include former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and more than 40 people associated with him. 
Several people, including former Macedonian rebel leader Ali Ahmeti, were removed from the list.
In other news Thursday, former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica called for new elections in Serbia. 
He accused the ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition of losing touch with the people. 
Infighting among leaders, he said, is stalling reforms.

NEW YORK, United States -- The Serbian government must increase the effectiveness of its search for fugitive Ratko Mladic, UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz wrote in a report he presented to the UN Security Council on Monday (December 6th).
Brammertz noted that despite the stated political commitment, little progress has been achieved in locating and apprehending Mladic and fellow wartime fugitive Goran Hadzic.
The chief prosecutor added that while co-operation with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is satisfactory, Serbia has so far failed to fulfil its commitments to the tribunal.
In addition, Brammertz called on the international community to exert more pressure on Serbian authorities, with regards to the country's EU accession, in order to speed up its co-operation with the court.

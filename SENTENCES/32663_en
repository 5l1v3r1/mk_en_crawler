BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- President Vojislav Kostunica on Tuesday (24 December) called for an overhaul of election laws in Yugoslavia's two republics, and specifically for the removal of a provision that requires a turnout of 50 per cent to elect a president.
He told Beta news agency that turnout in other democratic countries is typically lower and that old laws are hampering change in Yugoslavia.
He also demanded a review of the registration lists to remove the names of nonexistent voters.
Twice now, his Democratic Party of Serbia has used the issue of inflated registration lists to contest the failed presidential elections, though without success.
Also Tuesday, Montenegro's electoral commission officially annulled the results of Sunday's presidential election because only 45.9 per cent of the registered voters had gone to the polls.
Filip Vujanovic was the clear front-runner with some 84 per cent of the votes.
He vowed to run again in next month's repeat vote.

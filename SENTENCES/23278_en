BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic says Serbia will apply for EU membership in 2009.
In an interview in Sunday's (December 28th) Vecernje Novosti, he acknowledged progress had slowed this year because of the Netherlands' refusal to allow implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU but added "I expect that in 2009 ...
the EU will make a decision to put us on the 'white' Schengen list." Complicating the effort, he noted, are the global economic crisis, the European Parliament elections in June and the time lost since Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty.
Also Sunday, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said 2009 could be the year of regional European integration.
"It will be primarily up to the EU and Serbia to see that happens.
If that relationship is such as we believe ...
then 2009 could be a year of integration for the Western Balkans," he told the FoNet news agency.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A trilateral drill among the militaries of Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia began in the joint border area of the Danube River on Monday (June 25th). 
The four-day exercise, the first of its kind among the three neighbours, is aimed at improving interoperability in crisis management. 
Over 1,600 army members and civilian officials are participating. 
The countries agreed on the drill earlier this month during a meeting at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.
In other news, Croatia will host a 12-day drill in early October, described as the biggest international exercise in the country since gaining independence. 
Its aim is to train naval and special troops for NATO Response Force missions and tasks. 
Over 9,000 soldiers from 13 NATO member states and Croatia will participate.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Thursday (3 April), Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic announced sweeping changes in the military. 
The changes are in response to the Orao arms-to-Iraq scandal and allegations of espionage by RS military intelligence. 
Though establishing a single BiH Army may not be possible, Cavic said, establishing a single command and civil control at the central level would be. 
He noted that this is a prerequisite for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Addressing an emergency session of the RS Parliament devoted to these problems and the related resignation of BiH Presidency Serb member Mirko Sarovic, Cavic said the scandals demonstrate the need to reorganise the Bosnian Serb Army. 
But he also reiterated his belief that Sarovic's resignation was unfounded and "forced" by the international community. 
The BiH House of Representatives is expected to take up the matter of Sarovic's replacement next week.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown voiced concern at the weekend over the controversial decision by Federation of BiH (FBiH) President Niko Lozancic to reduce the jail term of former FBiH Defence Minister Miroslav Prce, who was imprisoned for abuse of office and misappropriation. 
According to a statement by Ashdown's office Saturday (13 August), the decision to slash the sentence from five years to one year calls into question the rule of law. 
Prce was sentenced last September in relation to the so-called Hercegovacka Banka case and the financing of an illegal bid for Croat self-rule.
In other news, the BiH Transport and Communications Ministry says the route of the pan-European transport Corridor Vc on Bosnian territory was approved at a meeting Friday between Minister Branko Dokic and experts working on the project. 
The BiH section will be 340km long, including 75km of tunnels and 33km of bridges.

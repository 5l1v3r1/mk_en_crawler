PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The New Kosovo Alliance (NKA) party plans to submit to parliament a no-confidence motion against the government Wednesday (October 27th), in a bid to end the institutional crisis that has gripped the country since the resignation of President Fatmir Sejdiu late last month. 
NKA deputy leader Ibrahim Makolli confirmed that representatives of all political parties have joined the initiative, except for the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). 
Acting President Jakup Krasniqi, who is also the parliament speaker, wants to hold early elections on February 13th, now that the government coalition of three years is splitting up.

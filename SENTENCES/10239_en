BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's two main parties -- the Democratic Party (DS) and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) -- said Saturday (25 September) that they have reached a deal to form coalitions at the local government level. 
The joint statement came a day after DS leader Serbian President Boris Tadic and DSS chairman Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, met in Belgrade. 
The two parties said they also agreed to support democratic bloc candidates in round two of local elections on 3 October. 
Tadic said the coalition is open to "any parties that want to build the road to a stable, democratic and European Serbia". 
Kostunica meanwhile confirmed that DSS would not join any coalition at the local level with the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party of war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj.

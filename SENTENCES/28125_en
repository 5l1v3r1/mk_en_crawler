TIRANA, Albania -- The government's initiative to start reforming the election system was the main topic discussed on Tuesday (October 19th) between Prime Minister Sali Berisha and OSCE head Eugen Wollfarth, who says the time is right, as Albanian institutions are preparing for local elections in mid-May 2011. 
While the Electoral Code may be a good framework for democratic elections, the legal framework needs improvement, Wollfarth added. 
The junior ruling coalition partner, Socialist Movement for Integration, says it is ready to contribute to the reform effort. 
The opposition Socialist Party maintains it will co-operate only after the controversial June 2009 general elections are investigated (Shekulli, Top Channel, Alsat, Balkan Web - 19/10/10)

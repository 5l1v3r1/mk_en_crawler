ANKARA, Turkey -- The OECD warned Greece and Turkey on Thursday (24 April) that they must improve their deficit-to-GDP ratios and curb government spending. 
However, the organisation also forecasted that the Greek government deficit, currently 1.2 per cent of GDP, would drop to 0.7 per cent in 2004. 
Inflation is expected to remain at 3.5 per cent, well above the euro-zone averages.
The OECD report on Turkey said inflation would remain close to 30 per cent this year, while economic growth would slow to less than 4 per cent, compared to last year's level of 8 per cent. 
Analysts noted the increased debt burden and higher than anticipated interest payments on the debt, which created a large fiscal deficit in 2002.

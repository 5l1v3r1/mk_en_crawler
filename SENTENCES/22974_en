BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Hague tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz will spend two days in Belgrade next week, to discuss Serbia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, spokeswoman Olga Kavran announced on Tuesday (September 2nd).
Brammertz had planned to visit in July but that was postponed due to the operation that led to the arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
The chief prosecutor is due to present his report on Serbia's co-operation with the UN tribunal later this month.

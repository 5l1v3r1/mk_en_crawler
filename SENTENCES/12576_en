SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU Police Mission (EUPM) head Kevin Carty has accepted the apology and retraction of a controversial comment by Republika Srpska (RS) police chief Dragomir Andan, according to a statement Tuesday (7 June) from the EUPM.
The statement voiced Carty's satisfaction with a letter from Andan, in which he admitted he lacked evidence to support his claim that radical Islamic groups in BiH were linked to the 2004 train bombings in Madrid.
In other news Tuesday, Major General Novak Djukic handed over the post of RS Army chief to Deputy Commander Colonel Dragan Vukovic.
The NATO HQ in BiH and EUFOR dismissed Djukic last week for failing to respond adequately to incidents in April during a pair of RS Army oath-taking ceremonies.

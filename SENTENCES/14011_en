TRIPOLI, Libya -- The Libyan Supreme Cassation Court postponed its decision Tuesday (14 November) on the appeals of five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor sentenced to death on allegations -- widely disputed outside Libya -- that they deliberately infected children with HIV. 
The judges put off their ruling until 31 January. 
The announcement caused anger among a crowd of the children's relatives, who had gathered outside the court building, expecting the death sentences would be upheld. 
Clashes broke out that reportedly resulted in several injuries.

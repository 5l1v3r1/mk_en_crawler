MADRID, Spain -- Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino Picula said Wednesday (4 June) that his country fully realises the importance of regional co-operation for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, and is determined to play an active role. 
Picula made the statement while addressing a conference of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in Madrid. 
He said Croatia has made a significant progress on the path to membership in the Euro-Atlantic family, but more remains to be done. 
Picula also said that implementation of bilateral agreements on border traffic, co-operation and re-admission are key conditions for regional stabilisation and security.
In other news, the Croatian government decided Wednesday to suspend the visa regime for citizens of Serbia-Montenegro, from10 June until the end of the year. 
As agreed in Zagreb, full discontinuation of the visa regime would depend on Belgrade's return of Croatian registers.

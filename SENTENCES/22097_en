SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The European Commission (EC) will not sanction BiH if the upper house of parliament fails to adopt key police reform laws, Slovenian Ambassador to BiH Natasha Vodushek said on Tuesday (April 15th).
During a meeting of EU ambassadors with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, she said, "The responsibility for the possible failure to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU lies fully with BiH politicians, and voters ...
have to judge or punish them for their deeds at the next elections." Passage by the House of Peoples is expected late Wednesday, clearing the way for a potential signing ceremony in late April or May.

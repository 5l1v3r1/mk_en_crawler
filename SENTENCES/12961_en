SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Justice Minister Anton Stankov on Thursday (31 March) called for the next parliament, which will be elected in June, to conduct judicial reforms quickly.
He said any failure to reshape the system to better fight organised crime and corruption might jeopardise Bulgaria's planned EU entry in 2007.
A couple of weeks ago, Stankov suggested parliament cancel its summer vacation in order to work on judicial reforms.
In other news, the Bulgarian government decided on Thursday that the country's 400-strong contingent would remain in Iraq until the end of the year.
Parliament must now confirm the decision.

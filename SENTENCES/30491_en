TIRANA, Albania -- Contrary to many predictions, Albanian authorities saw no sharp rise in the number of citizens travelling to EU countries on day one of visa liberalisation Wednesday (December 15th). 
Police said that 363 people used their biometric passports to travel to the EU without a visa. 
Most of them, 176 people, left via Tirana International Airport. 
A number of people have been returned by Greek authorities for lacking health insurance or sufficient financial means.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader told reporters Monday (2 February) the views expressed by UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte on Croatia are fair and objective.
He predicts The Hague will release a positive report on Croatia, despite del Ponte's criticism concerning retired General Ante Gotovina's fugitive status.
Regarding overall co-operation with the tribunal, del Ponte has been quite positive, says Sanader.
In other news Monday, the interior ministry announced that Croatia has joined the International Centre for Migration Policy Development.
Deputy Interior Minister Zarko Katic stressed that membership will secure access to information on illegal migration in Europe and will help the country draw up a national strategy on migration policies.

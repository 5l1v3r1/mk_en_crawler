BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO has decided to send two more Patriot missile batteries to help protect Turkey in case of war with Iraq, AFP reported on Wednesday (12 March).
The Alliance has already dispatched three Dutch batteries to the country, as well as AWACS surveillance planes and chemical decontamination units.
On Thursday meanwhile, Prime Minister-designate Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to announce his choice of cabinet ministers.
Erdogan is also expected to move quickly to have parliament vote again on a proposal allowing the deployment of more than 60,000 US troops on Turkish territory.
State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said Wednesday that war in neighbouring Iraq would result in up to 276,000 refugees.

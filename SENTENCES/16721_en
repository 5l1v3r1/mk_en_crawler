THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- While in Belgrade last week, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte received assurances from Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that Ratko Mladic would be handed over by the end of this month, said the prosecutor's acting spokesperson, Anton Nikoforov, at a press conference Thursday (6 April).
He did not elaborate.
Promises from Belgrade convinced the EU to go ahead with this week's round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations.
Separately, Mladic's son confirmed Thursday that police had detained four of his relatives.
They were released after six hours of questioning.

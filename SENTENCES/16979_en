THESSALONIKI, Greece -- The foreign ministers of the South-East European Co-operation Process (SEECP) countries unanimously supported developing the region's ties with the EU on Wednesday (3 May), the first day of a two-day SEECP summit in Thessaloniki.
According to the participants, ties with the Union could be enhanced via expanding CEFTA and boosting preparations by local economies to meet the EU criteria for membership.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, who hosted the meeting, said they also agreed on the need to strengthen SEECP institutionally and on the establishment of an SEECP secretariat for co-ordination with the EU.
Also Wednesday, Moldova, which thus far has had observer status, was admitted as a full-fledged member.
On Thursday, the SEECP countries' prime ministers and heads of state meet.
Afterwards, Croatia takes over the rotating yearlong SEECP chairmanship from Greece.

PARIS, France -- France on Thursday (5 February) completed ratification procedures for admission of seven new NATO members, the last Alliance member to do so. 
The group of new members includes Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. 
Representatives of the 19 NATO members signed protocols with the candidates last March, anticipating ratification would take about a year. 
A recent declaration by the Alliance suggests that the newcomers will participate in the June summit in Istanbul as official members.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- In just four days, unions collected 57% of the necessary 450,000 signatures required to call a referendum on proposed amendments to the labour law. 
Ozren Matijasevic, chairman of the trade unions association, discussed the progress on Sunday (June 13th) and urged more people to back the drive. 
Zoran Milanovic, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, is among those who signed it. 
The proposed labour law would set a six-month deadline for hammering out a new collective agreement after the existing one expires. 
After that, workers' rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers. 
By law, any group has 14 days to collect the signatures required to hold a referendum, but none has been successful since Croatia declared independence in 1991.

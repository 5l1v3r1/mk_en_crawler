BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Dragan Cavic continued to consult with parties in parliament Wednesday (22 December), seeking broad political support for a future prime minister-designate and a new entity cabinet.
Cavic said Tuesday that he has met with representatives of the main Serb, Bosniak and Croat parties and is willing to also hold talks with smaller formations.
He reiterated that the government crisis which followed the resignation of Dragan Mikerevic's cabinet last week should be settled as soon as possible.
BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic, meanwhile, confirmed Tuesday that a second member of the Serb Party of Democratic Progress, Transport Minister Branko Dokic, has resigned.
BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic stepped down over the weekend.
Terzic said the cabinet would not meet until replacements are found.

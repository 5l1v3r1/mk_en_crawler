SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's main opposition group, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, decided on Monday (February 12th) to remain in parliament after the majority withdrew a proposal to limit debates to ten minutes. 
Sponsor Liljana Popovska, leader of the Democratic Renewal of Macedonia party, said she was only trying to make parliament more efficient.
In other news Monday, former Defence Minister Jovan Manasievski was elected leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
He succeeds Risto Penov, who resigned to take responsibility for the party's failure in the parliamentary and local elections.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Managing Director for Europe and Central Asia Miroslav Lajcak said on Wednesday (April 13th) that Kosovo's partition is not a topic of discussion for the EU.
A new round of Belgrade-Pristina talks will be held before Easter, April 24th, Lajcak told the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee in Brussels.
Meanwhile, Kosovo media reported that the Slovak diplomat will not be nominated to temporarily act as the bloc's special representative in Kosovo as initially hinted at the beginning of the week.
He reportedly withdrew from this position amid pressure regarding his stances against Kosovo's independence.
Brussels is looking to merge the positions of EU Special Representative and head of the European Commission Liaison Office in Kosovo into one.

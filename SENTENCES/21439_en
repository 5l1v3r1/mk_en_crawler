SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Seven Bosnian Serbs received prison sentences Tuesday (July 29th) for their involvement in the murder of around 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica between July 10th and July 19th 1995.
The seven are responsible for killing 1,000 people in a single day.
Milos Stupar, Slobodan Jakovljevic and Branislav Medan all received 40-year sentences.
Petar Mitrovic received 38 years in prison, while Milenko Trifunovic, Brano Dzinic and Aleksandar Radovanovic got 42 years each.
This marked the first Srebrenica-related trial by a Bosnian court.
"The indictees deliberately executed hundreds of Bosnian Muslims ...
to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims from Srebrenica," said Judge Hilmo Vucinic during sentencing.
The trial, which lasted two years, initially had 11 police and military defendants.
The court eventually dropped charges against four of them.

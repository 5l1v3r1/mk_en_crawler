SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A US military aircraft on Wednesday (3 March) brought home the bodies of President Boris Trajkovski and eight other people who were aboard his plane when it went down near Mostar last week.
The public will pay their last respects to Trajkovski on Thursday;
a state funeral has been scheduled for Friday.
Afterwards, the Constitutional Court will decide to formally terminate his presidential mandate, clearing the way for elections to succeed him.
Meanwhile, a task force of Bosnian, US and Macedonian experts looking into the cause of the plane crash decided Wednesday to send the black boxes to a facility in Germany for analysis.
NATO's spokesman in Macedonia Craig Ratcliff warned against jumping to "premature conclusions or ...
looking for a scapegoat".

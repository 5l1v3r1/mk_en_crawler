ZAGREB, Croatia -- Nearly 73 per cent of Croatians support their country's bid to join the EU, according to results of a survey released Wednesday (28 January). 
That is down slightly from a poll conducted six months ago, which found 73.6 per cent backed membership. 
The ministry of European integration sponsors the surveys.
In other news Wednesday, Croatia's Constitutional Court returned the Media Act to parliament for a new vote. 
Describing it as an "organic law" regulating human rights and freedoms, the court said passage requires a majority of all seats. 
Instead, the measure was approved by a majority of those who voted.

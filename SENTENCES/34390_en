BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The association of pensioners in Republika Srpska (RS) organised protests in several towns Monday (20 October). 
The group says 70,000 people took to the streets demanding better benefits and immediate payment of overdue pensions. 
The rally in Banja Luka attracted around 3,000 demonstrators. 
Some attempted to enter government buildings, but police prevented major incidents. 
Other demonstrations took place in Prijedor, Zvornik, Bijeljina, Trebinje and Visegrad. 
An estimated 180,000 pensioners in RS receive an average of 60 euros a month, barely enough to cover food, they say.

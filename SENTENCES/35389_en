TIRANA, Albania -- A study presented at a session of the Council for Territorial Regulation on Saturday (17 April) suggests there are an estimated 47,000 homeless families in Albania. 
The study, by the ministry of territorial regulation and tourism, identified two major groups. 
The first comprises those who need shelter urgently, and includes about 9,760 families. 
The second group -- about 36,000 families -- share dwellings with other families, or live in dormitories, cellars or similar accommodations.

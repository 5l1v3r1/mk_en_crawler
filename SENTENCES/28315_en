ZAGREB, Croatia -- Leaders of the ruling Croatian Democratic Party (HDZ) on Friday (April 16th) criticised President Ivo Josipovic for some comments he made during a visit last week to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), accusing him of apologising for the 1990s war.
The HDZ, headed by Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, said the president's statement to the BiH parliament contradicted a declaration about the war in Croatia passed by parliament in October 2000.
It concluded that Croatia led a just and legitimate, defensive and liberating war, and not an aggressive and occupational war against anyone.
Josipovic says his speech was misinterpreted.
He insists he did not apologise for the war, rather, expressed "regret over the events in the past".

ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Friday (June 15th) that the Kosovo status settlement process and domestic reforms in Southeast European states are two key factors to regional stability. 
Bakoyannis was speaking at the opening of a two-day forum in Athens. 
The event, organised by the US-based Project on Ethnic Relations, drew political leaders from the Balkans, the EU and the US, as well as representatives of the Council of Europe, the OSCE and NATO. 
Bakoyannis cautioned that the destabilisation of Southeast Europe could affect the entire continent.

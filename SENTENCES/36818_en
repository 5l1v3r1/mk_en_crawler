ATHENS, Greece -- The Olympic flame became an instrument of crime-busting this week when a police helicopter accompanying it on the island of Crete spotted cannabis farms.
"The police helicopter was accompanying the flame on its journey, patrolling the skies above the actual torch relay route, when they spotted a cannabis farm near the town of Rethymnon," said a spokeswoman for the ministry of public order.
"They decided to stay and investigate, and eventually spotted other farms in remote areas outside the towns of Heraklion and Rethymnon with a total of around 7,000 cannabis plants." The torch is in the last phase of its tour around Greece, culminating in the 13 August opening ceremony at the main Olympic stadium in Athens.

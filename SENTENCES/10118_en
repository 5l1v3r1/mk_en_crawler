Romania will abstain from voting as the UN Security Council decides on a resolution granting immunity from the International Criminal Court to US military personnel, according to Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana.
Following consultations with the foreign ministers of permanent and non-permanent member states of the Security Council and with US diplomats, Romania has decided to withhold its vote, Geoana said.
Romania's UN ambassador, Mihnea Motoc, said his country would keep to its neutral position during what he described as a complex international debate.
In 2002, Romania became the first European country to sign a bilateral agreement with the United States on the non-extradition of US citizens to the ICC.
The government came under sharp criticism from EU officials for signing the agreement without consulting the European Commission on the issue.
While the agreement is still valid, it has yet to be discussed or ratified by the Romanian Parliament.
As an EU candidate country and a strong regional military partner of the United States, Romania is in the delicate position of negotiating between different requirements.
The United States needs at least nine favourable votes from Security Council members for the resolution to be adopted and for US soldiers to be granted immunity from the ICC.
The resolution was proposed last month, and then withdrawn.
The United States hopes the proposal will be adopted before 1 July when a prior resolution on the same issue expires.

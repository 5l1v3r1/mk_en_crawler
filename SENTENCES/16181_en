BUCHAREST, Romania -- European Integration Minister Anca Boagiu says the country has made considerable progress in the EU accession process, in an interview in Sunday's (16 July) Evenimentul zilei. 
She cited the adoption of a new penal code, new legislation on financing of political parties, as well as the establishment of a special state agency to inspect state officials' incomes and wealth statements as very important steps. 
Boagiu also noted that the government is working hard to overcome delays in other two fields -- agriculture and food safety -- described as problematic in the European Commission's latest monitoring report.

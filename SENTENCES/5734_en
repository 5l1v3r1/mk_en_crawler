The number of asylum-seekers in the industrialised world continued to decline in 2010, to nearly half the level registered at the start of the 21st century, the UNHCR said in a report Monday (March 28th).
A total of 358,800 asylum applications were lodged in 44 industrialised nations last year, marking a 5% drop compared with 2009, according to the UN refugee agency's annual snapshot of asylum trends. 
That figure was 42% lower than the level in 2001, the peak year in the past decade, when nearly 620,000 claims were registered.
"The global dynamics of asylum are changing. 
Asylum claims in the industrialised world are much lower than a decade ago while year-on-year levels are up in only a handful of countries," UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said on Monday.
Contrary to the global decline, however, there was a sharp increase in the number of asylum-seekers from Serbia (including Kosovo), which topped the global table with an 8% share of the total claims lodged in 2010. 
It was followed by Afghanistan (7%), China and Iraq, with 6% each, Russia and Somalia, each accounting for 5% of the global figures, as well as Iran (4%).
"In terms of places of origin, the largest group of asylum-seekers in 2010 was from Serbia," the UNHCR said. 
"The country saw a 54% increase compared to 2009, when it ranked sixth. 
Interestingly, the number of asylum applications in 2010 was comparable to 2001, soon after the Kosovo crisis."
There was also an increase in the number of claims from Macedonia last year, the UN refugee agency said, without citing any specific figures. 
It linked the rise in asylum-seekers from the two former Yugoslav republics to the EU's decision in December 2009 to introduce a visa-free regime for holders of Serbian and Macedonian passports.
The United States remained the largest individual recipient country for a fifth year in a row, with 55,530 applications in 2010. 
The 13% increase year-on-year was "partly due to a rise in the number of Chinese and Mexican asylum-seekers," the UNHCR said.
France, the second-largest recipient, with 47,800 applications, followed by Germany, with 41,330, also saw an increase of asylum-seekers, the UN agency noted, citing the larger number of applications from Serbia and Macedonia as one reason for that.
Sweden, which ranked sixth in 2009, moved up two places to fourth last year, due to an increase in asylum claims. 
The other country named among the five biggest recipients of asylum-seekers was Canada, where the number of applications fell significantly in 2010.
The other five major receiving countries were the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria. 
Among them, only Belgium saw an increase in the number of people seeking asylum in the country.

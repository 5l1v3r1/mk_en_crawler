ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Saturday (25 September) that it would launch a new push to resolve its long-running dispute with Macedonia over the latter's choice of name. 
"The government has the will to promote dialogue on the fundamental issues ... 
to find a solution acceptable to all on the issue of the name," a Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman said after a meeting on the problem between a Greek envoy and UN officials in New York. 
Greece considers Macedonia part of its cultural heritage and objects to the new Balkan state's use of the name. 
Macedonia was admitted in the UN in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a result of Greece's objections.

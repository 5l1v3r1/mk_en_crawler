BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Analysts say Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are close to meeting the criteria for visa liberalisation, but the countries still face issues in the rule of law sections. 
A preliminary report by the European Commission was presented on Thursday (September 2nd) to a panel of the European Parliament (EP). 
A mission of experts that visited Albania in July concluded that more efforts are needed in implementing legislation to fight corruption and organised crime. 
A final report is expected by mid-September.
EP rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, Tanja Fajon, asked that the issue be treated with urgency, as promised by Brussels. 
The main political groups in the EP confirmed that they will support the idea at a session in October if the EC thinks the two countries have met the criteria. 
But some lawmakers oppose the idea, fearing that free movement will enable Albanian criminals to continue trafficking in the EU. 
Fajon assured them that even if the visa regime is lifted, the monitoring process will continue.

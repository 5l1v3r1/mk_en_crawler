SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Programmes aimed at boosting Bulgarian business through EU and government funding are a major source of corruption in the country, the Sofia-based think tank Centre for the Study of Democracy said in a report Wednesday (January 28th). 
According to the document growing capital investment by the state leads to increased pressure for corruption in public tenders. 
This in turn increases the risk of misappropriation of government funds aimed at helping the economy, said Ruslan Stefanov, the author of the annual report. 
The document concludes that the number of companies willing to participate in public tenders is falling because of a general feeling that corrupt officials have chosen the winners in advance. 
Worsening that perception is the failure to sentence any senior politician or government official for corruption so far.

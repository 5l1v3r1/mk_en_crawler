BELGRADE, Serbia -- Stefano Sannino, deputy director-general of the EU's Directorate General for Enlargement, said Monday (February 14th) he expects the government to remain committed to the EU integration process and will continue with reforms, despite ongoing political difficulties. 
Sannino met in Belgrade with Interior Minister Ivica Dacic to discuss visa liberalisation issues. 
Dacic said Serbia is doing its best to prevent abuses of the visa-free regime and that authorities remain committed to tackling organised crime and corruption, and making borders safer.

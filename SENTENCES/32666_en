BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu said Saturday (21 December) that the cabinet needs to be reshuffled to improve efficiency.
Weakness in public administration reforms at the central and local levels might impede the EU accession process, Iliescu said.
He also said that he had discussed the issue with Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and had agreed on some adjustments.
In a separate interview, however, Nastase rejected the notion of any near-term cabinet changes.

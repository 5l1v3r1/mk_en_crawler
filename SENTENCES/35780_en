ZAGREB, Croatia -- The European Parliament (EP) issued recommendations Thursday (1 April) to the European Council on Croatia's application for EU membership.
The EP welcomed Croatia's willingness to join the Union and described it as ready to meet the challenges along the road to membership.
The EP said also that a positive report on Croatia would send an encouraging signal to other countries in the region.
The adopted text advised Croatia to settle issues such as return of refugees and co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The EP praised the progress in economic reforms but urged the government to secure an independent media and judiciary.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Far-right politician Gigi Becali has gone to court to challenge a travel ban that prevents him from assuming his duties as a newly-elected member of the European Parliament (EP), local media reported on Monday (June 8th). 
Partial results of Sunday's European elections in Romania showed Becali, owner of the Steaua football club, has gained an EP seat as a candidate of the far-right Greater Romania Party. 
However, he will not be able to take office in Brussels unless authorities lift the ban and allow him to travel abroad. 
In April, Becali was arrested and charged with kidnapping three men who had allegedly stolen his car. 
Two weeks later, he was released on bail, but ordered to stay in Romania.

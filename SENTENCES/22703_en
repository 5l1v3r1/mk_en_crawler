ANKARA, Turkey -- More than 50,000 followers of Turkey's Alevi branch of Islam gathered in the capital Sunday (November 9th) demanding equal religious rights.
The demonstrators called on the government to abolish the Religious Affairs Directorate, cancel compulsory religious courses at schools and legalise the community's prayer houses, known as "cemevi".
Some political parties, including the main opposition Republican People's Party and the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party, backed the Alevi demonstration.
Observers called Sunday's march the biggest rally ever organised by the religious group.
The Alevis, the second largest religious community in Turkey, have long complained of discrimination and forced assimilation by the majority Sunni Muslims.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The head of the EU delegation to Serbia, Vincent Degert, and Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic endorsed an agreement Monday (March 22nd) on another 70.5m euros in anti-crisis financing. 
Serbia received 100m euros in budget support in December 2009. 
The funds are part of the EU's Instrument for Pre-Accession assistance.
In other news Monday, Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic said that within the next two weeks, parliament will receive the final version of a resolution condemning crimes committed in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1992-1995 conflict with debate to start immediately. 
Political parties are divided on the resolution, as most opposition parties want a parallel resolution condemning war crimes committed against Serbs during the same conflict.

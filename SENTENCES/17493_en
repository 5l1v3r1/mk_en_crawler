SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The mandate of the EU Police Mission (EUPM) in BiH should be extended because a major issue -- police reform at the state level -- remains unresolved, said EUPM head Vincenzo Coppola. 
Speaking on Friday (April 20th), he noted that only the State Information and Protection Agency and the BiH Border Police are currently operational on the state level.
The same day, the chairmen of the Sarajevo and Banja Luka municipal courts, Goran Salihovic and Milan Tegeltija, held their first-ever meeting, in a bid to co-ordinate efforts and rationalise the use of human and material resources. 
They agreed on the need for strengthened co-operation to boost the government's judiciary and economic reform efforts.

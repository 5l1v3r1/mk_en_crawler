GENEVA, Switzerland -- The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN on Friday (14 January) called on authorities in Serbia and Kosovo to resume talks aimed at establishing the fate of 3,000 people who remain missing nearly six years after the Kosovo conflict. 
The ICRC said it was ready to lead a working group on the issue. 
Soren Jessen-Petersen, the top UN officer in Kosovo who was visiting Geneva for talks with ICRC officials, welcomed the idea of Red Cross-mediated negotiations and said its implementation could finally lead to progress.

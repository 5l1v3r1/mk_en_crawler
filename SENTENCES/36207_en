SKOPJE, Macedonia -- At an emergency session Sunday (7 March), the government adopted draft amendments to the law on electing a president, aimed at enabling a new vote within the 40-day term set by the constitution. 
The changes, which have now been forwarded to parliament for approval, would shorten the time needed for other election-related procedures, such as collecting signatures in support of candidates, submitting final nominations and launching campaigns. 
The move follows the death of President Boris Trajkovski. 
On Friday, the constitutional court formally terminated his mandate. 
Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski is provisionally assuming his duties.
In other news, NATO Ambassador to Macedonia Nicolaas Biegman said Sunday that, in his view, the security situation in Macedonia remains unchanged despite Trajkovski's death. 
He added that he sees no reason for interethnic tensions in the upcoming elections. 
Biegman said NATO is ready to participate in the investigation into the plane crash in Bosnia and Herzegovina that killed Trajkovski, as it is in the interest of both NATO and Macedonia to determine what happened.

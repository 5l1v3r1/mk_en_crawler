ANKARA, Turkey -- An Ankara court on Friday (March 9th) sentenced four Turkish Kurd politicians -- former deputies of the outlawed pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) -- to 7.5 years in prison, convicting them of involvement in a terrorist organisation.
This was a third trial brought against Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Selim Sadak and Orhan Dogan since 1991, when they entered the Turkish parliament as deputies from the DEP.
The party was outlawed in 1994.
The four subsequently lost their parliamentary seats and, after two trials, were jailed until 2004.
Lawyers for the four voiced deep disappointment over the ruling.
Zana, Dicle, Sadak and Dogan are senior members of the DEP's successor, the Democratic Society Party, which has said it aspires to enter the next Turkish Parliament.

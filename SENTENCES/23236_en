BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said on Monday (December 29th) that Republika Srpska can count on Serbia's support at any time and that Belgrade is ready to establish special parallel relations with the other BIH entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
"If Sarajevo is willing to do that, Serbia is absolutely ready," Jeremic told the Banja Luka-based daily Nezavisne Novine.
In other news, hundreds of Bosnians turned out to protest a ban on Santa Claus in kindergartens in Sarajevo, media reported on Monday. 
Directors of Sarajevo's day-care centres, kindergartens and nurseries have decided to ban the tradition of Santa Claus bringing children presents, arguing the capital is predominantly Muslim. 
But hundreds of parents -- wearing red hats and singing Christmas carols -- staged a protest Sunday outside a Sarajevo cathedral, demanding restoration of the popular tradition.

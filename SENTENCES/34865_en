ZAGREB, Croatia -- Firefighting brigades, local residents and even tourists joined efforts Thursday (31 July) to extinguish wildfires that have raged in southern Croatia, destroying forests, olive groves and fields.
At least three islands -- Bisevo, Hvar and Brac -- and a national park on Velebit Mountain have been affected.
Winds and high temperatures have hampered firefighting efforts.
The prefect of Split-Dalmatia county, Kruno Peronja, said he would declare a disaster area.
However, he also urged residents to remain calm, insisting all blazes were under control.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The foreign ministry announced on Friday (April 30th) that a Kosovo Albanian suspected of war crimes in Serbia has been arrested in Germany.
Bujar Bobani, 36, is charged with war crimes against civilians committed in Kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict.
According to Serbian media, prosecutors believe Bobani was associated with a group led by Anton Lekaj.
In 2007, the former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army was sentenced by a Belgrade court to 13 years in prison for killing Roma civilians in June 1999.

VIENNA, Austria -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic addressed a session of the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on Wednesday (September 10th), saying dire predictions he had made about the consequences of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence are becoming a reality.
He added, however, that it is not too late to prevent matters from spinning out of control.
Jeremic also used the opportunity to present Serbia's initiative to seek the International Court of Justice's opinion on Kosovo's February 17th declaration.
Earlier Wednesday, he said it has a good chance of success.
Separately Wednesday, US Ambassador to Serbia Cameron Munter reiterated his country's opposition to Serbia's initiative on Kosovo.
"We hope that we can persuade the government to focus on the future and not the past and to work together for its EU integration," Munter told the daily Blic.
Also Wednesday, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci met with the head of the Greek liaison office in Pristina, Dimitrios Moschopoulos, and said he expects Greece to recognise Kosovo's independence in the near future.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government on Friday (November 21st) confirmed its decision to file a counter lawsuit against Croatia for war crimes and genocide allegedly committed against ethnic Serbs during 1995's Operation Storm. 
Belgrade has decided to begin the procedure for filing the case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Trade Minister Slobodan Milosavljevic told reporters. 
He said the government would form a legal team to work on establishing the facts about conflicts in Croatia during the 1991-1995 conflict. 
The foreign ministry will prepare the countersuit, Milosavljevic said. 
Belgrade's move came in response to Croatia's decision to file a lawsuit against Serbia accusing it of ethnic cleansing during the war. 
Last week, the ICJ ruled that it has jurisdiction over the suit and would hear it.

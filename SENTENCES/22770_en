BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Albania and Croatia signed protocols on their NATO accession Wednesday (July 9th) at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels.
With the signing, the two countries took another step on the road to full membership, expected at NATO's summit in Strasbourg and Kehl next year.
The next step after the initialling of the protocols will be for Albania and Croatia to ratify their accession treaties.

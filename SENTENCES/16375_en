BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu sealed a decree on Tuesday (12 September) that suspends Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu from his post, in light of criminal proceedings launched against him last week. 
The investigation to determine if Atanasiu unveiled classified information about the location of Romanian troops abroad might require testimony by subordinates in the defence ministry, potentially leading to conflicts of interest, Basescu said.
He also issued a decree Tuesday forcing the retirement of the chief of the army's general staff, General Eugen Badala. 
Anti-corruption prosecutors are investigating him regarding a military supply deal brokered in 2000.
In another development, Basescu sent a report to parliament Tuesday suggesting the restructuring of participation in peacekeeping missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq by the end of this year. 
The document indicates Basescu wants to reduce the presence in Iraq, while boosting the one in Afghanistan.

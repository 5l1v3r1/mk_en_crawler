SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The government decided on Monday (18 August) to double the reward offered for information on those still missing since the 2001 conflict, to 50,000 euros. 
Government spokesman Saso Colakovski says the interior ministry has already received several phone calls and is now verifying the information. 
The ministry has spent more than a year investigating the fate of 20 people -- 12 Macedonians, seven ethnic Albanians and one Bulgarian national -- who disappeared during the security crisis.

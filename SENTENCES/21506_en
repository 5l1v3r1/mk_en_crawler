BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Serbian Radical Party and other ultranationalist organisations are holding a rally Tuesday (July 29th) to protest the transfer of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
An appeal against Karadzic's extradition was filed by his lawyer, Svetozar Vujacic, late on Friday. 
But a spokeswoman for the Belgrade District Court said on Monday the appeal has not yet been received. 
Government sources quoted by Reuters say Karadzic will be transferred to The Hague secretly to avoid media attention.
A police source cited by the Belgrade-based daily Press said on Monday that Serbian special services had followed Karadzic for months before his arrest last week. 
Contact reportedly was made during a symposium in late May. 
More than 50 agents followed him after that. 
Karadzic was living in Belgrade under the false identity of Dragan Dabic, practicing alternative medicine. 
According to the source, two agents posing as patients managed to obtain a sample of Karadzic's hair, which authorities used to conduct a DNA test and confirm his identity.
Separately, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic announced on Monday that during a raid of Karadzic's apartment in Belgrade, police found copies of materials from the General Staff of Republika Sprska's army. 
The manuscripts, calendars, plans and photographs were turned over to the Serbian war crimes court.

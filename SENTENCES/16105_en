LUXEMBOURG -- UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte presented her report on Serbia's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to the EU Troika -- top diplomats of former, current and future EU presidency holders -- during a meeting in Luxembourg Monday (October 16th). 
She said there is no political will in Serbia to meet its international obligations, particularly the requirement to hand over war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic.
Later Monday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, confirmed that Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Serbia would not resume, due to the lack of war crimes co-operation. 
Their announcement followed a meeting in Luxembourg with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.

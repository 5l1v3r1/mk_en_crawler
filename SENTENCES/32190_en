THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Slobodan Milosevic's war crimes trial was postponed for the second time this month Tuesday (12 November) after the former Yugoslav president complained of exhaustion.
According to presiding Judge Richard May, Milosevic also suffers from high blood pressure.
The delay comes a day after Milosevic appeared in court for the first time in ten days and rejected a suggestion by prosecutors to accept an attorney.
Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte asked the court to appoint a lawyer to keep the trial on track and reduce the strain on Milosevic.
May said the judges wanted to hear more arguments before making a decision.

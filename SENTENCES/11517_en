SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Representatives of EUFOR and the two BiH entities' armed forces on Friday (18 February) signed a Mine Removal Action Plan, which calls for clearing about 1,200,000 square metres of mines this year. 
For the first time, entity armies would be directly engaged in the detailed planning of mine removal activities. 
The chief of the BiH Armed Forces' Operational Command, Major General Vlado Dzoic, expressed hope that the process would be transferred soon to the state level after the needed legal framework is adopted.
Also on Friday, the head of the BiH State Investigation and Protection Agency, Sredoje Novic, told local television that BiH has no chances to join the EU without a full reconstruction of its police sector. 
He said the current system -- which consists of 14 police agencies and employs 23,000 people -- lacks co-ordination. 
Noting that the Office of the High Representative's proposal for state-level command does not seek to abolish entity interior ministries, he urged Republika Srpska to find a solution as soon as possible.

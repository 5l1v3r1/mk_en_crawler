BUCHAREST, Romania -- An organisation representing the Szekler's ethnic group, which makes up about one-third of the Hungarian minority in Romania, has vowed to hold a referendum on autonomy. 
Csapo Jozsef, president of the National Szeklers' Council, said the unofficial plebiscite would be held to focus the attention of the EU and the Romanian government on the demands of the Hungarian minority. 
The government insists that the Hungarians enjoy full minority rights and rejects all calls for autonomy.
Still unclear is whether two other ethnic Hungarian formations, the junior government partner UDMR and the n Magyar Civic Union, will support the idea.

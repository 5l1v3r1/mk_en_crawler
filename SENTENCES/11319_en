SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EBRD President Jean Lemierre has said he believes the situation in Macedonia has improved over the past two years and that reforms are proceeding.
In an interview with the Macedonian-language programme of Deutsche Welle earlier this week, Lemierre said that during a recent visit to Skopje he received assurances that planned reforms in the banking system and the small- and medium-sized enterprises sector were being implemented.
He noted that investors' interest has increased lately throughout the Western Balkans.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh praised the Turkish government on Monday (3 February) for its efforts to bring the country's human rights situation into line with EU standards. 
"The ambitions of the new government make it much, much easier for Turkey to become a member of the EU," Lindh said after talks with Prime Minister Abdullah Gul and Justice and Development Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Turkey has recently abolished the death penalty, granted cultural rights to the Kurdish population and moved to stop torture.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin announced, meanwhile, that Erdogan will run in the by-elections in Siirt on 9 March. 
This could open the way for the leader of Turkey's ruling party to take a seat in parliament and then move into the prime minister's post, which is currently held by his close associate Gul.

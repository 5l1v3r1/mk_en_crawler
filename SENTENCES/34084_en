BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said Tuesday (22 July) that political factions within Serbia-Montenegro should stop bickering and move together to join the EU. 
Solana, who met with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic in Brussels, said "Serbia and Montenegro will undoubtedly enter EU structures faster together than as separate entities."
In other news Tuesday, Serbia-Montenegro offered to help NATO track down top Bosnian war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic, a move diplomats said was aimed at removing a major obstacle to closer ties with the Alliance. 
President Marovic also signaled a readiness to discuss Belgrade's lawsuit against NATO nations for the 1999 Kosovo air campaign. 
The Alliance insists the case must be dropped before the country can join its Partnership for Peace programme.

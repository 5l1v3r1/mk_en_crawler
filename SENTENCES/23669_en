NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government has demanded a full investigation after a Turkish TV star said he killed Greek Cypriots during Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus, local media reported on Saturday (January 24th).
Actor Attila Olgac, who served in Cyprus during the 1974 intervention, told a TV show in Turkey that he killed ten Greek Cypriots in cold blood.
On Friday, Cypriot government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou said the government will take "all necessary steps" regarding the issue.
The confession stunned the Cypriot public.
Olgac said he first shot a 19-year-old prisoner of war dead and then nine others.
Later, however, Olgac retracted his statement, saying it was false and aimed at attracting attention to the brutality of war.

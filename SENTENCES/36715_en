BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jocic said Monday (26 July) that police are searching for Goran Hadzic, the war crimes indictee photographed leaving his home only hours after a Hague indictment was secretly handed over to local authorities. 
The war crimes tribunal has harshly criticised Belgrade for leaking information about the indictment. 
Jocic denies it was a government leak.

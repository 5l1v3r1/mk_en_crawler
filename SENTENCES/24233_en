PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- The EU agreed on Thursday (March 12th) to delay modifying the role of its military force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
At a meeting in Prague, the EU defence ministers concluded that while the security situation was stable and the peacekeeping forces had fulfilled its military goals, political reforms were incomplete, said Czech Defence Minister Vlasta Parkanova, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency.
"For the time being, there has been no decision" as to when the role of the force in BiH will change, Parkanova told a press conference.
Meanwhile, the Dnevni Avaz newspaper reported on Thursday that EU security chief Javier Solana would tell the UN Security Council that recent constitutional reform talks in BiH have failed again.
According to the newspaper, which cites leaks from Solana's regular quarterly report, the document concedes political tension in the country is high but downplays concerns regarding possible destabilisation.

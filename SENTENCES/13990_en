PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen warned on Monday (15 August) that the Serb side, rather than Kosovo institutions, would be blamed for any failure in the decentralisation process if Kosovo Serbs continue boycotting the provincial institutions.
Returning from a trip abroad, Jessen-Petersen said the cabinet's revised decentralisation concept, dubbed Plan B, is a significant opportunity for progress.
He added that the coming weeks would be crucial to the province's future status.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The chances of joining the EU are slim for most Western Balkan countries, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday (October 31st), quoting from a report on the region drafted by the European Commission.
According to the leaked document, corruption, organised crime and international tension are slowing reforms in the Western Balkans.
The report says establishing the rule of law through reforms in the judicial system, coupled with fighting corruption and organised crime would lead many of the countries to EU accession.
The report says corruption is widespread and deeply rooted in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo and Turkey.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The parliament on Friday (July 10th) approved a proposed reshuffle of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's cabinet, media reported.
Gruevski said the reshuffle is designed to address the impact of the global financial crisis amid fears of upcoming recession.
The opposition, however, asked for the entire cabinet's resignation over its failure to fulfil its promises and bring Macedonia closer to the EU and NATO.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte plans to visit Serbia one more time early next month before her mandate expires.
She hammered out the date during a meeting Friday (November 16th) with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic at The Hague.
Afterwards, Jeremic stressed the need for full co-operation with The Hague tribunal, in terms of both Serbia's EU prospects and regional reconciliation.
On Sunday, Serbian Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic, who also heads the national council for war crimes co-operation, announced that four raids were conducted last week in search of fugitive indictees.
One, he said, resulted in a sizeable amount of weapons, enough "to arm a platoon".

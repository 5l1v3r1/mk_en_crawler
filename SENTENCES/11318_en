TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the OSCE Presence in Albania, Ambassador Pavel Vacek, has expressed concern over the behaviour of local politicians and candidates ahead of the 3 July parliamentary elections.
In an interview with Radio Free Europe cited on Thursday (23 June) by local media, Vacek warned that some candidates were not fully complying with the Code of Conduct, which was adopted by parties to ensure the highest democratic standards.
He reiterated that the elections would be a crucial test of Albania's political maturity.
Also Thursday, President Alfred Moisiu urged all parties to respect the Code of Conduct.
Moisiu said his recent meetings with leaders of the main parties were aimed at ensuring a calm and democratic atmosphere ahead of the elections.

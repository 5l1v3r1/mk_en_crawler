PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Police and KFOR have stepped up security measures in Mitrovica, after two explosions hit the northern, Serb-dominated part of the divided town Saturday (January 24th). 
Police spokesperson Besim Hoti said on Sunday that initial investigations suggest hand grenades were the weapons but noted that KFOR is investigating in more detail. 
The blasts caused damage but no injuries.
In other news, the government is promising to correct all irregularities that may have occurred during the selection process of Kosovo Security Force (KSF) staff, in response to complaints by members of the defunct Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC). 
About 1,400 KPC members joined the new force on January 20th, while hundreds of others protested on Friday against what they described as unfair entry tests and manipulated results. 
The KSF is accepting applications from civilians to join the new force, which will total 2,500 members.
Separately Friday, the government decided to increase the salaries of public sector employees. 
More than 70,000 workers will benefit from the 10% salary increase and pension hikes of 12%.

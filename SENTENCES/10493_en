SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The leader of the Union of Free Democrats -- Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski -- said Monday (18 October) that his party would back a potential right-centre coalition headed by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg.
According to Sofianski, such a scenario would ensure consistency with policies followed so far and at the same time refresh the ruling NMS-II-led coalition, whose image has been suffering.
Also Monday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy started a four-day trip to Western Balkan countries.
In his capacity as OSCE's current chairman-in-office, Passy will visit Macedonia, Serbia-Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania.

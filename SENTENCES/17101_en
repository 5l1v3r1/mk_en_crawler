PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The leader of the opposition Socialist People's Party (SNP), Predrag Bulatovic, resigned at the weekend, following a meeting of the SNP's main board on Saturday (September 30th).
The party plans to hold a congress on November 25th, to elect a new chairman, as well as executive board members.
Last month, Bulatovic announced that he would step down in light of SNP's poor performance in the parliamentary elections.

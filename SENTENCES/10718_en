SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The foreign ministers of BiH and Montenegro agreed on Tuesday (9 November) to boost co-operation between the two countries in the search for war crimes suspects. 
Mladen Ivanic and visiting Montenegrin counterpart Miodrag Vlahovic say they decided to work closely with the UN tribunal in The Hague. 
Vlahovic also became the highest-ranking Serbia-Montenegro official to visit the memorial to victims of the Srebrenica massacre.
In other news, the UN tribunal is hearing a request by the lawyers of Slobodan Milosevic who want to leave the case because of lack of co-operation from the defendant. 
No date has been set for the ruling.

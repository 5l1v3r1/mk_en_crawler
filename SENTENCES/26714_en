TIRANA, Albania -- People whose homes were damages in an earthquake that rocked the Dibra region late Sunday (September 6th) spent Monday night out in the open, rather than sleeping inside unstable houses. 
The quake in northeast Albania measured 5.4 on the Richter scale. 
Head of Dibra municipality Xhaferr Seiti said nine houses in the region were completely destroyed. 
Lesser damage is still being assessed. 
The government says it will establish a fund to rebuild the houses and provide shelter for the homeless.

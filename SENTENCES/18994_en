SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Popular Sofia Mayor Boyko Borissov officially changed his political movement, GERB, into a political party on Sunday (December 3rd).
During the founding meeting in Sofia, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, a former deputy mayor of Sofia for security, was elected leader.
By law, Borissov cannot hold a party leadership while also serving as mayor.
GERB describes itself as centre-right and cites as priorities the fight against crime and corruption, preserving the family as the foundation of society, and achieving energy independence.

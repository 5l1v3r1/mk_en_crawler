TIRANA, Albania -- The National Guard has played down claims that its members fired on demonstrators during the January 21st opposition rally in Tirana that ended with three protesters dead.
On Thursday (February 3rd), the head of the service, Ndrea Prendi, testified before the parliamentary panel investigating the events, saying his personnel fired only into the air.
"The Guard will open fire on demonstrators only when protection rings are broken, a situation which was avoided," Prendi testified.
He confirmed that the National Guard used every means to protect the buildings, which demonstrators attacked for hours.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Recognition of Macedonia's constitutional name by the United States has been widely celebrated in the Balkan country. 
President Branko Crvenkovski hailed the decision on Friday (5 November), describing it as the most significant diplomatic victory since Macedonia gained independence in 1991. 
A rally was held in Skopje under the slogan "Farewell Former, Farewell Yugoslav, Hello Republic of Macedonia".
Greece, meanwhile, warned on Friday that it would block Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO if an agreement were not reached on the name issue. 
Greece objects to calling its neighbour Macedonia for historical reasons.

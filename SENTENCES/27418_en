PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Working groups from Kosovo and Serbia met on Wednesday (May 26th) in Pristina to discuss technical details ahead of the exhumation of a mass grave discovered in Raska, southern Serbia, earlier this month.
"We expect the work to begin intensively in two to three weeks at the latest," the AFP quotes Pajazit Nushi, head of the Kosovo delegation, as saying.
Serb officials promised last week to start a thorough investigation.
The grave is believed to contain the remains of 250 Kosovo Albanians killed during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.

Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and his Albanian counterpart, Lulzim Basha, signed a visa liberalisation agreement Tuesday (February 19th), allowing citizens of the countries to travel freely.
The prime ministers of the two countries, Macedonia's Nikola Gruevski and Albania's Sali Berisha, who also attended the agreement signing ceremony in Tirana, said it was a major step in the region's European and Euro-Atlantic future.
The decision to open borders between the countries comes only few weeks after controversy erupted regarding Macedonia's announcement that it would implement a stricter visa regime.
"This agreement will help businesses and citizens to move more freely," Gruevski told reporters, explaining that this will negate the previous Macedonian government announcement that it would provide visas to foreigners only in diplomatic offices of the respective countries.
The new visa regime will allow citizens to reside in the neighbouring country for 90 days without a visa, within a time frame of six months.
The free visa regime will be active once the agreement is ratified by both countries' parliaments.
This agreement will help tourists and members of Albania's business community.
The free movement will facilitate reaching Kosova and other countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey by using Macedonia as a transit point.
Additionally, Macedonia launched visa liberalisation talks with the EU on Wednesday.
EU Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini is scheduled to meet with President Branko Crvenkovski, Gruevski, Milososki and Interior Minister Gordana Jankuloska in Skopje.
From there, the EU commissioner is expected to travel to Podgorica on Thursday to start visa liberalisation talks with Montenegro.

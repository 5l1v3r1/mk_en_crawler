SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik cancelled a referendum aimed to contest the legitimacy of the state-level judiciary on Friday (May 13th). 
Dodik said the decision followed his meeting with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who gave him enough guarantees that the work of BiH's judiciary would be reviewed and that appropriate reforms could be made. 
Bosnian Serbs accuse the state-level judiciary of being biased. 
Ashton said the European Commission would launch a "structured dialogue" on the work of BiH's judiciary as part of the country's efforts to join the EU.

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The government reportedly has set three conditions that must be met before any international arbitration can begin with Croatia to resolve disputes over the common border. 
Foreign ministry sources quoted on Wednesday (August 22nd) say Slovenia wants the procedure to encompass all borders, maritime and landline. 
Officials also insist that talks should include neighbouring vicinities, and that the status quo as of June 26th, 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia left Yugoslavia, should be taken into account.
So far, only informal talks have been held between the Slovenian and Croatian governments. 
No official confirmation has been made that arbitration will actually occur.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors have questioned four Romanian journalists as part of an investigation into the leak of classified information from the defence ministry a few months ago, according to media reports Friday (17 February).
Romania Libera correspondent Marian Garleanu reportedly was arrested Thursday for suspected possession of secret documents, including details about coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Garleanu denies any wrongdoing, and says he is being targeted for writing about corruption at the defence ministry.

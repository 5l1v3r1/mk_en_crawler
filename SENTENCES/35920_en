BRUSSELS, Belgium -- UN Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said in an interview published by a Belgian newspaper on Saturday (17 January) that the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic may have foiled the arrest of Ratko Mladic, the UN tribunal's most wanted war crimes suspect. 
"Two weeks before his death, [Djindjic] told me that reforms of the army and the police were almost complete and he promised that I would have Mladic in the spring," del Ponte told the <I>La Libre Belgique</I> daily, adding that last year's assassination "threw everything into disarray".
In the same interview, del Ponte renewed her criticism of Croatian authorities. 
She accused "part of the Croatian government" of supporting fugitive general Ante Gotovina who is charged with the deaths of more than 150 Serb civilians.

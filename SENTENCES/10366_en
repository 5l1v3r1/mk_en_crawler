ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE Mission to Croatia issued a report Monday (22 November) that urges authorities to launch more efforts to sustain the momentum of reforms. 
Mission chief Ambassador Peter Semneby said that while the country has made progress in refugee returns and judicial reform, the pace has slowed in other areas.
In other news, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Serbian counterpart Vojislav Kostunica agreed in a phone conversation Monday that bilateral co-operation is of major importance to regional stability. 
The call followed the well-publicised weekend arrest of three Serbian students in Zagreb. 
They were detained for disturbing public order.

VIENNA, Austria -- The OSCE on Tuesday (June 22nd) urged Turkey to lift its blockade of the popular video exchange website YouTube and respect international standards of freedom of expression.
More than 5,000 websites have been blocked in Turkey since 2007, when an internet law was introduced to prevent access to child pornography and other harmful contents.
"I ask the Turkish authorities to revoke the blocking provisions that prevent citizens from being part of today's global information society," OSCE media freedoms chief Dunja Mijatovic said in a statement.
Turkey first blocked YouTube in 2008, citing contents offensive to the founder of the Turkish republic, Kemal Ataturk.

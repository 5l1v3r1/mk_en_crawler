SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria and Russia agreed on Friday (September 18th) to speed up implementation of the South Stream project, during a meeting in Sofia between Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and Russian Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko.
Borisov reiterated Bulgaria's commitment to the project but at the same time expressed doubts regarding another large-scale joint venture -- construction of the Belene nuclear power plant.
He said it could only start after an audit proves that Bulgaria's national interests are protected.
Sofia insists that the 10 billion-euro price tag is too high, given the global economic crisis, especially as Bulgaria is the poorest EU member.
If the project is launched at all, Bulgaria may decide to reduce its 51% stake in order to attract more investors, Energy Minister Traycho Traykov said.
Russia's Shmatko expressed readiness for a similar deal.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Former Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana lost the leadership post of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) at a party congress that ended early Sunday (February 21st). 
Geoana will be replaced by lawmaker Victor Ponta. 
The PSD has a new chance to show that it can change and accept a young leader, Ponta, 37, said after the results were announced. 
He called for unity inside the party, plagued by endured deep divisions since Geoana lost a tight race for president against incumbent Traian Basescu in December. 
Ion Iliescu, a former president of Romania, announced officially at the congress that he is withdrawing as honourary PSD chairman, but said he would remain a member.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The Republic Election Commission said on Tuesday (February 5th) that it will not announce the official results of the presidential elections as planned on Thursday (February 7th), but rather ten days later. 
The delay follows a decision to repeat the second round of voting at one polling station in the Boljevac municipality on February 12th. 
The results will not change the outcome, however. 
Incumbent President Boris Tadic won 50.5% of the votes, according to preliminary results.

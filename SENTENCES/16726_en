SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In several separate statements Thursday (6 July), the international community described Wednesday's parliamentary elections in Macedonia as free, fair and in accordance with all democratic standards.
ODIHR chief Audrey Glover said there were only isolated examples of irregularities, while the head of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's monitoring mission, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said the vote generally met democratic standards.
The two international organisations had some 380 observers at the polls.
The head of the European Commission delegation to Macedonia, Erwan Fouere, US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic and EU Security Chief Javier Solana welcomed the manner in which elections were conducted.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged the quick formation of the next government so the country loses no time in preparing for Euro-Atlantic integration.
The newly elected parliament is to meet for the first time on 25 July at the latest.
Nikola Gruevski began on Thursday to build a ruling coalition after his VMRO-DPMNE won the vote.
There are reports that he will try to form an alliance with the main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration.

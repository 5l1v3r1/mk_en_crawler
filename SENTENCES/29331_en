SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Zeljko Komsic and Nebojsa Radmanovic are likely to win re-election as BiH tripartite presidency members, the State Election Commission (CEC) announced in the early hours of Monday (October 4th) based on early results.
Bakir Izetbegovic, deputy leader of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and son of the late President Alija Izetbegovic, is set to become the new representative of the Bosniak community.
Komsic, representing the Social Democratic Party (SDP), scored the most convincing victory, with 59% of the votes for the Croat seat on the presidency, defeating the candidate of the Croat Democratic Union of BiH (HDZ BiH), Borjana Kristo.
Radmanovic is the frontrunner for the Serb seat, with 49.84%, but his lead over Mladen Ivanic is a slim 3% and the outcome could change as more votes are counted.
In the Federation of BiH (FBiH), Izetbegovic has won around 34.65% of the vote for Bosniak presidency member, while media mogul Fahrudin Radoncic is second with 30.26%.
The latest data suggested turnout was 56.3%.

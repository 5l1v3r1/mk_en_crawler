ANKARA, Turkey -- State Minister Kursad Tuzmen has cancelled a trip to New York, where he was supposed to attend a Turkish-US investment conference Sunday (October 14th).
His decision was prompted by a Congressional committee's decision to approve a resolution terming the World War I-era mass killings of Armenians a genocide.
Turkish Navy Commander Admiral Metin Atac also scrapped plans for a US visit.
Two US officials have been dispatched to Turkey to try to ease strained relations.
Undersecretary of Defence Eric Edelman and Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Daniel Fried arrived in Ankara to meet with the deputy chief of the Turkish General Staff, Ergin Saygun, and Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ertugrul Apakan.

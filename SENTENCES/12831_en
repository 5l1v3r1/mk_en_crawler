TIRANA, Albania -- Wrapping up a two-day meeting in Tirana on Tuesday (3 May), the Adriatic Charter signatory countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- reiterated their hopes for an invitation to join NATO during the Pact's next summit in 2006. 
In statements issued after the session, the foreign ministers of the three states reaffirmed their commitment to co-operation and maintaining security in the region. 
They also said the expansion of the Adriatic Charter communication process to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro illustrates the determination of Western Balkan countries to implement reforms and join Euro-Atlantic structures. 
On Wednesday, the defence ministers of the Charter states meet with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in Brussels.

ANKARA, Turkey -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrives in Ankara on Monday (17 May) for talks with Turkish leaders expected to focus on Turkey's bid for EU membership. 
He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer during his daylong visit. 
London has been a staunch supporter of Turkey's efforts to join the EU. 
Blair said during a recent visit to Paris that Turkey's EU accession should follow the same rules that were in place for all other candidates for membership. 
According to local media, the situation in the Middle East, Iraq, and Cyprus, and next month's NATO summit in Istanbul are also on the agenda. 
The Turkish leaders are expected to ask Britain to lift its sanctions against the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus".

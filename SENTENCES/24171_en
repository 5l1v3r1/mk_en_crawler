PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A fast train travelled from Belgrade to Zvecan on Sunday (December 14th) morning, using 38km of tracks in Kosovo without informing local or international authorities in Pristina. 
It was not the first to enter Kosovo from Belgrade, media reported on Tuesday. 
Newspapers reported that Serbian state-operated railways "conquered" a part of the Kosovo railways by activating a morning line between Kralevo and Zvecan in March, followed by afternoon service along the same line in September. 
"This is a classic occupation", said Sabit Thaci, deputy head of the Kosovo Railways trade union.

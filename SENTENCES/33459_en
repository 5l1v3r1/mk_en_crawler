WASHINGTON, United States -- The State Department has praised the Greek government's successful efforts in fighting terrorism during 2002. 
In its annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report, the US government notes the dismantling of the 17 November network, blamed for the killings of 23 Greek and foreign officials. 
Cofer Black, the department's counterterrorism co-ordinator, called Greece's progress in fighting terrorism "historical". 
He also praised Athens for its approach to security for the 2004 Olympics. 
The State Department, however, noted an increase in the number of low-level acts of violence committed by anarchists and other extremists in Greece. 
Washington also called on Athens to close the offices of several organisations it considers terrorist groups.

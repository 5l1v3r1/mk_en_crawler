TIRANA, Albania -- The Council of Europe's Congress of Local and Regional Authorities sent a letter to Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Thursday (11 May), expressing concerns with the implementation of the European Charter for Local Self-Government. 
The letter follows a last month's visit by a delegation from Brussels, which observed the level of wrangling between the central and local authorities -- especially in Tirana, where the mayor is also the leader of the largest opposition party. 
The head of the congress, Giovanni di Stasi, asked the government to clarify a legislative amendment regarding local governance, as well as reforms related to the process of decentralisation.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A court has charged three more suspects in connection with a car bomb attack in Diyarbakir earlier this month that killed seven people and injured more than 60, including schoolchildren and army personnel.
The suspected bomber purportedly has confessed to carrying out the attack on orders from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in retaliation for the Turkish Army's attacks on its bases in northern Iraq.
The PKK says the bombing was the work of Kurdish militants outside its control.
In other news, the health ministry confirms that the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been discovered on a poultry farm in northern Turkey.
The farm, in the village of Saz, is under quarantine.
Two years ago, bird flu killed four children in a small village in eastern Turkey.

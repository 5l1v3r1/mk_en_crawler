PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The government of Kosovo completed repairs on an apartment building in Pristina that housed most of the city's Serbs.
Rioting ethnic Albanians set the units on fire in March.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi handed the keys of the renovated apartments to Charles Brayshaw, the deputy head of UNMIK.
Brayshaw said he was pleased that the government had acted quickly to restore the Serb homes, but warned that the psychological damage would have to be repaired as well.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Political directors of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board concluded on Wednesday (June 30th) that conditions have not been met to close down the Office of High Representative. 
Wrapping up a two-day meeting, they urged leaders to resolve the issue of defence property allocation and to begin destroying surplus weapons and ammunition immediately. 
The PIC Steering Board also voiced concern over the delay in amending BiH's Constitution, in light of a December ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which concluded that the constitution discriminates against minorities. 
The Board also urged authorities to adopt a law on conducting a census. 
They praised BiH's progress in meeting criteria for EU visa liberalisation and encouraged authorities to fulfil remaining requirements for visa-free travel.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The leaders of the EU decided Friday (12 December) that Bulgaria and Romania could join the Union in January 2007 if they complete their accession talks with the European Commission in time.
The leaders endorsed 2004 as the date for completing the talks, allowing the Accession Treaty to be signed in 2005.
Bulgarian and Romanian politicians welcomed the news and said the decision was a confirmation of the two countries' progress in reforms.

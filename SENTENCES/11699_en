BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a session held in Belgrade on Thursday (19 May), the Serbian government approved amendments to the Serbia-Montenegro constitutional charter.
As agreed with Montenegro, the elections for the state union will now be organised alongside the republic's parliamentary elections.
The term of the current federal deputies has been extended until the next vote takes place.
The amendments also specify that any potential independence referendum should be held based on international democratic principles and in co-operation with the EU.
In other news, the Montenegrin parliament rejected the opposition's motion of no confidence in the government of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, by a vote of 27 to 39.
During the four-day discussion preceding the vote, the opposition accused the cabinet of being anti-European and anti-democratic.

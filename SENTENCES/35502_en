DUBLIN, Ireland -- Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said Tuesday (10 February) that his government would facilitate a decision on the possible start of accession talks with Croatia.
At a joint press briefing with his Croatian counterpart, Miomir Zuzul, Cowen said he hoped the EU would decide whether to launch membership negotiations with Zagreb at its summit in June.
Croatia wants to start the talks this year, in hopes of entering the Union in 2007 with Bulgaria and Romania.
In other news, Croatian EU Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar traveled to Brussels this week to describe to the European Commission progress in implementing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The talks are expected to play a crucial role in determining a start date for EU accession talks.

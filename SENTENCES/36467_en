ATHENS, Greece -- The Queen Mary 2, the world's largest luxury liner, arrived in the Athens port of Piraeus early Wednesday (11 August). 
The 150,000-tonne ocean ship will be home to at least two heads of state and several hundred other high-ranking guests during the Olympics.
The little-known Greek baseball team has caught the eye of international media with the fact that just one of its players was born in Greece. 
Most of the other players are North American and had never even visited Greece before the Olympics. 
They joined the squad because they had Greek grandparents or great-grandparents.
The Greek and Serbia-Montenegro soccer teams have an early start in the Olympics. 
The two teams are set to play South Korea and Argentina, respectively, in their opening games on Wednesday. 
The soccer tournament starts before the official opening ceremony.

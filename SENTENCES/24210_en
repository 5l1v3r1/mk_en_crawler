ANKARA, Turkey -- The country's new chief negotiator with the EU, Egemen Bagis, said on Tuesday (January 13th) that his country is ready to join the bloc but urged Brussels to value this determination and treat Turkey the way it treats other candidates. 
Bagis will accompany Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his visit to Brussels next week. 
"The road ahead of us is steep, but we are determined to complete negotiations; nobody should have any doubt about that," Bagis told a press conference in Istanbul. 
Establishing a ministry in charge of EU relations, a new Kurdish-language channel on Turkish national television and a programme of national reform all demonstrate Turkey's determination to fulfil Brussels' requirements, Bagis said.

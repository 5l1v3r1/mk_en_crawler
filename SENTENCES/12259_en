BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Vinko Pandurevic, a former Bosnian Serb general, has contacted authorities in Republika Srpska to negotiate his surrender, an adviser to Serbian President Boris Tadic said Saturday (11 December). 
The talks are apparently taking place in Serbia. 
The UN tribunal indicted Pandurevic in 1999 for his alleged role in the Srebrenica massacre. 
In 1995, he commanded the Zvornik brigade as a lieutenant colonel and was promoted to the rank of general in 1997, a year before he retired from the Bosnian Serb army.

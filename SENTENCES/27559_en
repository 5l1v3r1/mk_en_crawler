BELGRADE, Serbia -- Relatives of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic have been consulting with lawyers who are expected to file a motion to declare Mladic dead, Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti reported on Tuesday (May 25th).
Lawyer Milos Saljic explained that Mladic's family has decided to initiate the procedure for two reasons:
they want access to his frozen assets and pensions and they want to end all "pressure" exerted on them.
By law, the procedure can be initiated if the subject is older than 70 and there has been no reliable data on him for more than five years.
Mladic, however, is 68 and lawyers would need to prove that there are circumstances indicating he is dead.
Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's national council for co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal, called the request a mockery of the state.
Mladic disappeared shortly after the tribunal charged him in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.

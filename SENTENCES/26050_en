BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso sent a letter to the European Parliament (EP) on Friday (January 15th) stating that Bulgaria's Rumiana Jeleva has the necessary level of general competence in the field of humanitarian aid to become a member of the new commission. 
Jeleva, tapped to become commissioner of international co-operation, humanitarian aid and crisis response, has become a magnet of criticism for allegedly failing to declare a possible conflict of interest and giving unconvincing answers during hearings on her nomination.
In a letter to Barroso, Jeleva reiterated that the declaration of interests she filed after her nomination was totally correct. 
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov also reiterated his support for the Bulgarian candidate and stated that he will not withdraw her nomination.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The public prosecutor's office in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir launched an investigation Thursday (April 16th) of pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party leader Ahmet Turk over some controversial remarks, media reported. 
In a speech in Diyarbakir last month, Turk compared the imprisoned leader of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, to former South African President Nelson Mandela. 
He said the racial conflict in South Africa ended with Mandela's release from prison and that the Kurdish issue in Turkey could end too with Ocalan's release. 
Prosecutors have requested a transcript of Turk's speech from Diyarbakir police to determine if his comment amounted to PKK propaganda. 
Prosecutors may also ask parliament to lift Turk's legislative immunity.

TIRANA, Albania -- Christian Democratic Party (CDP) leader Nikolle Lesi confirmed on Wednesday (24 August) that his party will join Albania's new coalition government.
So far, it is comprised of the Democratic Party (DP), the Republican Party, the New Democratic Party, the Agrarian Environmentalist Party (AAP) and the ethnic minority Union for Human Rights Party (UHPR).
Previously CDP skirted coalition talks with the DP, alarmed over the participation of the two former Socialist allies -- the AAP and the UHPR -- in the government.

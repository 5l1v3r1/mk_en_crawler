NEW YORK, United States -- The top UN negotiator of a unification blueprint for Cyprus will brief the Security Council on the plan's fine print Friday (2 April) but will not ask the council to endorse it, diplomats and UN officials said.
Special envoy Alvaro de Soto is to present the 9,000-page document in a public meeting of the 15-nation council, which is then expected to issue a statement urging the divided Mediterranean island's Turkish north and Greek south to approve it in twin referendums on 24 April.
The White House on Thursday lobbied the island's two communities, describing the plan as a compromise that "meets the core interest of all parties".
Echoing that sentiment, European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen urged the Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders to convince their constituents that the plan represents "the best and most balanced solution that can possibly be achieved".

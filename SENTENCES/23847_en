SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Top international envoy to BiH Miroslav Lajcak announced Friday (January 23rd) that he will be leaving his position as of Monday. 
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico nominated Lajcak as their country's new foreign minister, it was announced on Friday. 
Lajcak will assume his new position on Monday, but will return to BiH to oversee the high representative responsibilities until his successor is named, according to sources.
Local media has speculated on three candidates for the position -- Austrian MEP Hannes Swoboda, former European external-affairs commissioner Chris Patten and former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
Lajcak serves as both the head of the OHR and as the EU Special Representative (EUSR) and has held both jobs since July 2007.

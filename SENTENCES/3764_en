After Christmas and New Year's festivities end, an estimated 200,000 Croatians are expected to head to the ski slopes in Croatia and neighbouring countries. 
Skiing is becoming the favorite winter sport, though Croatia's generally mild climate limits the number of ski resorts. 
Only a few mountainous areas get enough snow to ski.
Medvednica Mountain, which surrounds Zagreb, is currently one of the most visited weekend resorts. 
On January 6th, however, when the long winter school break begins, Croatian families will travel to resorts in nearby countries.
The second week of January is called "Croatian week" or "Croatian tsunami" in the largest Italian, Austrian and Slovenian resorts because of the large number of Croatian visitors. 
They pack the resorts although nobody is sure if there will be snow.
Tourist agencies say Austrian ski villages are overwhelmed with Croatian guests, while the number of those travelling to France and Italy has slowly been decreasing.
Croatians had not, as a rule, been a ski-loving nation in the past.
In recent years, though, interest in the sport has ballooned, partly due to the popularity of four-time Olympic gold medalist Janica Kostelic, who retired from competition this year.
Kostelic made her decision after ten knee operations and thyroid surgery, fearing she might risk worse injuries in the future. 
The hazards of skiing, however, have not discouraged Croatians from taking up the sport.
Nor has the fact that skiing is an expensive sport that requires travel and purchasing equipment and ski passes.
At the peak of the ski season, all-inclusive trips cost at least 800 to 1,000 euros. 
However, in an effort to make the trips more affordable, agencies will offer to divide the cost into regular monthly installments.

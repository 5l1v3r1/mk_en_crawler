BUCHAREST, Romania --The Supreme Defence Council approved a US proposal Thursday (February 4th) to deploy elements of a planned defence shield in Romania. 
"Terrestrial interceptors will be located inside the national territory," President Traian Basescu said, adding that the facilities should be operational by 2015 and that the new system is not directed against Russia. 
Negotiations between Washington and Bucharest on specifics will start soon. 
Any agreement requires approval by the Romanian parliament. 
Last year, US President Barack Obama cancelled a planned missile shield to be based in Poland and the Czech Republic.

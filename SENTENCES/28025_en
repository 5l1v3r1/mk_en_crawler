BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Rajko Kuzmanovic denied on Wednesday (April 21st) that the entity is attempting to minimise the crimes committed in Srebrenica in July 1995. 
On Tuesday, High Representative Valentin Inzko criticised a recent decision by the RS government to revise a report drafted by the previous government on the number of those killed in the Bosnian enclave. 
Inzko said that Banja Luka's decision is "a despicable attempt to question that genocide took place in Srebrenica by deliberately distorting established historical and legal facts". 
Kuzmanovic insisted RS has no intention of denying the Srebrenica crime, but rather, wants "to fix" some elements for the sake of both history and the future.

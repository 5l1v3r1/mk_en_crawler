ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told business leaders on Saturday (11 September) that his government has drawn up a plan to cut military spending and sell state-owned firms, to curb the country's mounting budget deficit and public debt.
The defence budget would be reduced by 400m euros in 2005 and will be cut further through 2010, he said.
The cabinet's privatisation programme was expected to bring in 1.5 billion euros, the prime minister explained.
Karamanlis mentioned plans to float the Postal Bank on the Athens Stock Exchange and to find a buyer for the debt-ridden Olympic Airlines.
Greece's budget deficit is expected to reach 5.3 per cent in 2004, well over the three-per-cent EU ceiling.
Public debt has climbed to 112 per cent of GDP.

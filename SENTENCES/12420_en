BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO foreign ministers reiterated at their summit in Brussels on Thursday (9 December) that Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia must fulfil their obligation to co-operate with UN war crimes tribunal.
The foreign ministers reaffirmed their support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries in the Western Balkans, while expressing deep concern over the latest report by the UN tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte.
The ministers noted that improved relations with the tribunal is the major condition for joining the Partnership for Peace programme.
While BiH and Serbia-Montenegro have both made some progress in reforming their armies, the ministers said, they continue to be ineligible for participation in the programme because of their poor record of arresting war crimes suspects.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Representatives of the ruling National Liberal Party (PNL), the Hungarian Democratic Union in Romania (UDMR), and the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) and Conservative Party (PC) reached an agreement Tuesday (February 19th) regarding the single vote draft law that is now expected to be passed by parliament in two weeks. 
It would allow voters to back just one candidate, rather than a slate of several seeking office. 
The PNL's Mihai Voicu, the head of parliament's committee for the electoral code, said after the meeting that they managed to reach consensus on nearly all articles of the draft.
In other news, the PSD and the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) issued separate statements Tuesday warning they might initiate a no-confidence vote against the government. 
Their reasons, however, were different. 
The PDL is upset with the government's failure to annul a tax related to car registration. 
The PSD is dissatisfied with ruling coalition member UDMR's position on the independence of Kosova. 
The UDMR, which unites ethnic Hungarians in Romania, has urged the government to recognise independence.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton voiced disappointment Saturday (January 22nd) with the outcome of talks among major world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany -- and Iran. 
At the end of the two-day negotiations in Istanbul over Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, she said no further talks were planned. 
Ashton, who led the so-called P5+1 group, pointed out that Iran's preconditions relating to uranium enrichment and sanctions are unacceptable. 
"The process can go forward if Iran chooses to respond positively," she. 
Iran's chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, said Tehran's demands weren't unreasonable.

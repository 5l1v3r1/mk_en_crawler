ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan on Monday (January 5th) called for the establishment of an international monitoring group to ensure a viable solution to the conflict in Gaza and said Turkey is willing to contribute to such a mission. 
"We think that any solution should be guaranteed by the international community and there is a need for a group of international monitors for any solution to be sustainable,'' Babacan told a joint press conference with visiting Syrian counterpart Walid al-Muallem.
Also Monday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone with his Russian, British and Italian counterparts Vladimir Putin, Gordon Brown and Silvio Berlusconi to discuss Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza. 
They also discussed problems in delivering humanitarian aid to the region. 
Erdogan briefed them on his Middle East tour last week, aimed at ending the violence in Gaza.

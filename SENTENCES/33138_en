THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic told the UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (17 June) that Slobodan Milosevic had allowed the Yugoslav Army to train volunteers for the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He thus confirmed the prosecution's claim that Milosevic, who was president of Serbia at the time, had control over Serb separatists in the former Yugoslav republics.
In other damaging testimony, Lilic confirmed that the Yugoslav leadership planned the formation of a united Serb nation by blocking independence for republics that had Serb minorities on their territories.
However, he also tried to exonerate Milosevic in connection with the Srebrenica massacre, saying Milosevic was "outraged" by the killing of thousands of Muslims because it hurt his stance at the Dayton peace talks.

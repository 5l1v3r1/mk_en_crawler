PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- The six-nation Contact Group for Kosovo strongly condemned recent violence against Serbs in the province, reiterating that the international community would not tolerate such incidents. 
According to a statement issued jointly Tuesday (26 September) by the Contact Group's representatives to Pristina, Kosovo has entered an extremely important period and any violence is harmful to the province's interests.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu also denounced the latest incidents, insisting on Tuesday that authorities find those responsible and punish them. 
After the latest attack -- by a group of Albanians on a Serb in Mitrovica -- UNMIK was forced to close the freshly reopened main bridge in the ethnically divided city.
Meanwhile, US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried visited Belgrade on Tuesday and said that the Serbian minority, history and heritage in Kosovo must be preserved, regardless of what the future decision on the status would be. 
He urged that the status issue be resolved this year.

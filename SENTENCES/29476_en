BELGRADE, Serbia -- The war crimes prosecution office is expected to decide on Monday (August 2nd) whether to lodge an appeal against a London court's decision to free former Bosnia and Herzegovina presidency member Ejup Ganic. 
Last week the court rejected Serbia's extradition request, ruling that charges against Ganic could have been politically motivated. 
War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said that his office will hold a video conference with the UK prosecution office on Monday and will decide on how to further proceed.

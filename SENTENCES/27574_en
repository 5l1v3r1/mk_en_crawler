SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov went on national television Thursday (April 29th) to announce that his government intends to raise the standard VAT increase from 2% to 5%.
That would raise it to 22%-25%.
Borisov says the hike is necessary until the cabinet's anti-crisis measures begin showing more results.
After that, he said, the VAT rate would be returned to 20%.

NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer agreed on Wednesday (May 28th) in New York that there should be no security gap in Kosovo as of June 15th, when Kosovo's constitution is due to come into force.
De Hoop Scheffer called for clarity in the way UNMIK is going to evolve following this date, as NATO has no desire to take on a policing role.
Reportedly, he and Ban agreed that the alliance should continue its peacekeeping mission and that UNMIK will continue to be in charge of policing.
The EU's plans to assume those duties through its EULEX mission face months of delay.

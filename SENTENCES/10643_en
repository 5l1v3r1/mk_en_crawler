SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Hari Kostov and UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen agreed Thursday (9 September) that the border demarcation process is a priority and should be completed before final talks on Kosovo's status.
Jessen-Petersen visited Skopje to discuss initiatives to intensify co-operation between Macedonia and Kosovo.
At a joint news conference afterwards, he said he suggested the signing of a provisional bilateral co-operation agreement and the opening of a free trade office, as well as establishment of a direct air connection between the airports in Skopje and Pristina.
Kostov says the Macedonian government backed the proposals.

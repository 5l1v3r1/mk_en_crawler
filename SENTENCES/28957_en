BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament decided on Tuesday (June 8th) to schedule a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet for June 15th.
Debate ahead of the vote is being held Wednesday.
At issue are two bills covering fiscal austerity measures, containing deep cuts in public sector salaries, pensions and other benefits.
If the cabinet survives the vote, the measures are effectively implemented.
Opponents need to collect 236 votes against the government to bring it down, so both they and the ruling coalition are scrambling for support among the 471 lawmakers.
Analysts say it may well come down to those representing ethnic minorities and the few independents in parliament.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Over 300 coal miners from the Horasti mine, in the Motru mining region, blockaded themselves underground Tuesday (19 November) to protest the planned closure of the mine. 
The miners refused to come out, demanding that management preserve some 600 jobs or offer them the equivalent of five years' pay. 
They held the management's negotiator underground with them for a couple of hours before releasing him due to heart problems.

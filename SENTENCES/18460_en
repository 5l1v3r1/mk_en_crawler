SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) requested on Tuesday (February 13th) that the mandate of the BiH commission checking past citizenship requests be extended beyond Friday, when it is set to expire.
The panel was formed a year ago to review suspected cases of illegally granted citizenship to foreigners.
OHR spokesman Oleg Milisic noted that any extension must be approved by the BiH Parliament.
However, as its upper house has not been constituted yet, BiH institutions must find a legal way to resolve the problem before the end of this week.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided on Monday (November 27th) to permanently assign a defence attorney to Serbia's Vojislav Seselj, after he refused to attend the opening hearing. 
Britain's David Hooper will represent Seselj, who led a paramilitary unit that allegedly committed crimes against non-Serbs in BiH and Croatia during the 1990s. 
Seselj remains the leader of Serbia's powerful Radical Party. 
His trial has been delayed because of what the court describes as his disruptive behaviour during proceedings. 
He refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of the court and insists on defending himself, much as Slobodan Milosevic did during his trial. 
Seselj, 52, began a hunger strike two weeks ago.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou on Thursday (March 10th) urged the EU and euro zone members to take measures against rating agencies, accusing them of "undermining the stability of the countries using the euro". 
His demand came in Brussels, ahead of a meeting of euro zone leaders to discuss ways to strengthen the common European currency. 
On Monday, the rating agency Moody's downgraded Greece's credit rating citing large-scale tax evasion, huge work still ahead for authorities in efforts to implement austerity measures, and a possible decision by the EU to restructure the country's debt after 2013. 
Athens described Moody's decision as "incomprehensible".

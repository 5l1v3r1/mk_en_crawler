BUCHAREST, Romania -- A European Commission (EC) report to be published on Wednesday (July 23rd) will suggest delaying Romania's accession to the Schengen passport-free area and the euro zone if there is no progress in its fight against corruption, Romanian media reported on Monday.
For the first time since accession negotiations began, Romania and Bulgaria may undergo separate evaluation rather than as "a package", media suggest.
According to initial reports, Romania will receive criticism for corruption but its violations will not trigger the safeguard clause.
Bulgaria, however, will face financial sanctions.

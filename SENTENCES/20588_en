SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who now holds a seat in parliament representing the VMRO-People's Party, has decided to enter Bulgarian politics, according to media reports Thursday (August 9th).
Georgievski has joined a committee backing Kyril Pandev, former head of Balkan Bank Skopje, to become mayor of Blagoevgrad in Bulgaria's October 28th local elections.
In addition, A1 TV says Georgievski might run for the city council himself.
He has been a Bulgarian national for two years, and has a legal residence in Blagoevgrad.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Ibrahim Shabani, head of the Bureau of Statistics, said on Tuesday (April 12th) that around 1.5 million people have been registered during the first ten days of the population census.
This number does not include Serbs living in the north who are boycotting the process despite calls for participation from Kosovo and international institutions.
Minister for Public Administration Mahir Yagcilar said that officials are working on a plan to register all citizens, with help from the European Commission and the UN Office for Project Services.
The census started on April 1st and ends on Friday.

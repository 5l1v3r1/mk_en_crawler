ANKARA, Turkey -- Central Bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz said on Monday (October 27th) the Turkish economy needs no financial support from the IMF for now. 
"At this stage we do not need money from the IMF. 
However, there are uncertainties about what we might face in the coming period. 
Therefore, we see it as beneficial to implement some regulations in order to restore confidence in the global markets," Yilmaz said. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he does not favour a new deal with the IMF. 
"In this crisis period, we will not bury our future by bowing to the demands of the IMF." Turkey's latest $10 billion standby agreement with the IMF expired in May.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament decided on Wednesday (April 13th) to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed laws, particularly on the BiH Court and Prosecutor's Office.
The decision was backed by 66 lawmakers, two voted against and seven abstained.
RS President Milorad Dodik told parliament that BiH's Court and Prosecutor's Office are biased regarding war crime cases involving Serbs, leading to inter-ethnic hatred and intolerance.
The date of the referendum has not been set.
Prior to the vote, High Representative Valentin Inzko voiced concern over discussions in the assembly, warning that an entity's attempts to subvert a state level law violate the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Inzko also recalled that the 2003 laws on the BiH State Court and on the Prosecutor's Office were adopted by the BiH parliament in 2002, backed by all lawmakers from both entities.

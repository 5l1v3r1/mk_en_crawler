ATHENS, Greece -- Health and Social Solidarity Minister Mariliza Xenogiannakopoulou announced on Monday (May 31st) -- World No Smoking Day -- new plans to ban smoking in all public places, "at work, in restaurants, cafes and bars", Xenogiannakopoulou said in a statement. 
The new measures, slated to take effect on September 1st, will tighten an already existing ban, which obliges all establishments over 70 sq m in area to designate special smoking areas, while smaller ones can choose to allow smoking or go entirely smoke-free. 
These regulations are routinely violated, as over 40% of the population are smokers. 
Work is also under way to draft a bill that would ban outdoor tobacco advertising, cigarette advertising in cinemas and the practice of handing out free cigarette samples.

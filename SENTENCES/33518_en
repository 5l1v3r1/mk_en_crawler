SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR commander General William Ward urged local authorities Tuesday (23 September) to accept a defence reform bill aimed at fostering integration into NATO and the EU.
Ward said the planned reform would not change the armies inside the two entities but would help merge them under one flag.
Also Tuesday, it was announced that senior NATO officials would visit Sarajevo on Thursday and Friday to collect information about SFOR's work in BiH.
In other news, the prosecutor's office in BiH confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating a Republika Srpksa-based firm suspected of illegal oil imports.
According to BHTV 1, the probe into the Orea Group concerns false registrations.

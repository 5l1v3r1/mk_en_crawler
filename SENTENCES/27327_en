SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said on Friday (October 30th) that his country will not change its name without a referendum. 
He met informally Thursday with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, on the sidelines of a European Council summit in Brussels. 
In an interview with MIA news agency, Gruevski pointed out that his government backs the idea of a referendum, though some senior EU officials -- including foreign policy chief Javier Solana --have rejected it. 
Gruevski stressed that without a referendum, there is no possibility of resolving the longstanding dispute with neighbouring Greece.

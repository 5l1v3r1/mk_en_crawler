BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro is an inseparable part of Europe and the EU would not be complete if the county is excluded, said the Special Co-Ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, Erhard Busek.
In an interview for the Belgrade-based daily <I>Politika</I> on Sunday (17 August), Busek said EU expansion after 2004 is impossible without Serbia-Montenegro, but added that there is no time to waste in resolving differences between Serbia and Montenegro.
He was adamant that the countries could only enter the Union together.

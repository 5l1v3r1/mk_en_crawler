BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned Russia on Wednesday (March 21st) not to block the adoption of UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo.
"If the UN Security Council fails to agree, there will be instability and even chaos in the region.
As in the early 1990s, Europe will have to pay the price, not Russia, not the United States," he said.
Rehn also noted that Kosovo is "an important litmus test" for the EU's own security policy.
Meanwhile Ahtisaari, who served as UN intermediary in talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, is for the first time openly recommending Kosovo's secession from Serbia.
"Upon careful consideration â¦ I have come to the conclusion that the only viable option for Kosovo is independence, to be supervised by the international community," Ahtisaari wrote in a four-page letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday reiterated his country's opposition to the Ahtisaari plan.
Speaking to the lower house of the Russian Parliament, he appeared to indicate that Moscow could use its veto power to scuttle the blueprint, rather than abstain from voting.

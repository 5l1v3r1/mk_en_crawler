SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A five-judge panel of the Supreme Administrative Court on Monday (February 14th) cleared Ahmed Dogan, leader of the biggest ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), in a major corruption trial. 
The panel upheld an earlier ruling by a panel from the same court -- this decision is not subject to appeal. 
The case opened in September after a parliamentary panel found a possible conflict of interest involving Dogan, who had received about 1m euros for consulting on hydro power projects in 2008 and 2009, when his party was in power as a coalition partner. 
The court found there was neither evidence suggesting Dogan violated the public interest, nor violated conflict of interest legislation, since a law on disclosing such conflicts was adopted after Dogan signed his contract.

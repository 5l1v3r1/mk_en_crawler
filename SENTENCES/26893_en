ANKARA, Turkey -- Envelopes containing eight Kalashnikov rifle bullets were delivered on Tuesday (January 5th) to a judge and a prosecutor involved in the investigation into an alleged assassination plot against Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc. 
Judge Kadir Kayan and Prosecutor Mustafa Bilgili are part of the investigation that began eight days ago. 
On Monday, a court in Ankara rejected a request by the General Staff to terminate the investigation. 
It began when Arinc announced last month that two army officers had been spotted near his home on several occasions. 
A total of eight Turkish soldiers were arrested as part of the investigation but later released.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK on Friday (October 3rd) reopened its court in Kosovska Mitrovica, closed since clashes between Serbs and international security forces in March.
"We are reopening the court in Mitrovica, and you can see that more and more people are returning to their jobs," UNMIK spokesman Georgi Kakuk said on Friday.
He added the court will resume full operations on Monday.

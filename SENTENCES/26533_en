LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- A court in Slovenia on Wednesday (December 9th) sentenced Croatian wartime veteran Josip Zagajski to 11 years in prison for plotting an assassination attempt against Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor. 
Zagajski, 60, was arrested in July aboard a train travelling from Zagreb to Ljubljana. 
Carrying several hand grenades, he tried to activate one of them while detained. 
Although he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, the court ruled he was aware of what he was doing.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- In an interview in Friday's (22 July) Danas newspaper, Florence Hartmann, spokeswoman for UN war crimes tribunal prosecutors in The Hague, described the fact that indictee Ratko Mladic remains a fugitive as "unacceptable". 
She confirmed that prosecutors are confident Mladic is in Serbia, and criticised Belgrade's lack of initiative in meeting obligations. 
She stressed that Hague prosecutors are not police, and that it the responsibility of local authorities to collect information on war criminals. 
She also reiterated chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte's warning that the policy of voluntary surrenders -- favoured by the government of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica -- has its limits.

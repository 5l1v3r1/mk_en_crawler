SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov called for restraint Sunday (9 May) in the case of five Bulgarian medics, sentenced to death last week in Libya for allegedly spreading the HIV virus to hospitalised children. 
On Sunday, Parvanov met with Foreign Minister Solomon Passy and Justice Minister Anton Stankov to discuss the issue. 
Parvanov may visit Libya to appeal for leniency. 
The international community has roundly condemned the verdict and sentences.
In other news, the chief of Bulgaria's National Investigation Office, Angel Alexandrov, says some heads of regional investigative offices would be replaced, due to inefficient work. 
Alexandrov did not mention specific names but said much will depend on the number of completed cases over the past few months.

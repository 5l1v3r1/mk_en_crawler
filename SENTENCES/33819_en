SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Stjepan Pocrnja, a member of the Standing Military Committee, said Thursday (20 November) that the BiH presidency supports the possibility of sending peacekeepers to Iraq on the basis of its own decision, not as a result of obligations to international organisations.
Opposition members, however, accused the presidency of rushing the debate.
Sead Avdic, of the Social Democratic Party, told BHTV 1 that the country should wait for a UN resolution to determine BiH's possible participation.
In other news, the European Commission's resident delegation in BiH says it is dissatisfied with recently approved amendments to the indirect tax act, particularly one that would establish a new regional tax office in Brcko.
The delegation says the move violates the recommendations of the Feasibility Study for BiH, which followed the EU's positive assessment of the country's tax reforms.

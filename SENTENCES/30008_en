ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested about 70 people Thursday (March 24th) who tried to defend representatives of the main pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) during a sit-in protest in the southeast city of Batman. 
Tension rose when police officers began removing a tent set up in mid-March, when the sit-in began. 
Officers said the tent served as a "base in protests that disrupted traffic and led to the injuries of eight police officers". 
They added that an unlicensed gun and documents of an illegal organisation were seized during the raid. 
Four people in the tent were arrested for links to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

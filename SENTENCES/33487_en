SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said in an interview from his hospital bed on Saturday (27 September) that Muslims, Croats and Serbs should move beyond their divisive pasts. 
"People should turn themselves towards the future and not revenge, since revenge initiates a series of evil things," he said. 
The former member of the BiH tripartite presidency is in critical condition following complications from a fall that left him with four broken ribs.

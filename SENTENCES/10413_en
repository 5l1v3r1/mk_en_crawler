WASHINGTON, United States -- During a visit to Washington Saturday (18 September), Montenegro Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic called for continued US presence in the Balkans, saying this was an important guarantee for stability in the region. 
Vlahovic, who was speaking at a bilateral Montenegrin-US forum, said the US presence was especially necessary in the light of the region's future political determination over the next few years.
On Friday, meanwhile, Belgrade media reports said representatives of the Serbian Defence Ministry and the Serbia-Montenegro Army's General Staff have held talks with NATO officials on a new programme of co-operation, aimed at assisting defence reforms and integration into the Partnership for Peace Programme.

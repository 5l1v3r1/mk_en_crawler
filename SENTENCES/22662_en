CAIRO, Egypt -- Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic participated in an Arab League summit on Monday (September 8th), lobbying for Belgrade's initiative to seek the International Court of Justice's opinion on Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. 
Jeremic explained that Serbia's move is "a legal road forward, which guarantees peace and stability in the region and the preservation of international law". 
Jeremic said that Serbia will try to stop the Arab countries that are considering recognising Kosovo. 
After meeting with Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Jeremic said Cairo "is firmly against Kosovo's recognition". 
During his visit, Jeremic also met with Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa and the foreign ministers of other Arab countries. 
Diplomatic sources cited by Serbian media said Saudi Arabia is preparing to recognise Kosovo and may try to convince other Arab states to follow its lead.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A no-confidence vote against the government that was scheduled for Friday (November 28th) has been postponed, Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic said on Thursday.
The opposition Serbian Democratic Party, New Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party filed the motion over the cabinet's alleged negotiations with the EU on an agreement regarding its mission in Kosovo, EULEX.
The parties describe it as the first step towards recognition of Kosovo's independence.
The vote will be held, Djukic-Dejanovic said, but it is not clear when.

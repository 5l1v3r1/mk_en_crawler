BUCHAREST, Romania -- A month ahead of an eagerly anticipated European Commission (EC) report on Romania's progress, prosecutors indicted two former agriculture ministers for corruption Monday (June 9th). 
Allegations surfaced last fall, but Traian Decebal Remes and Ioan Avram Muresan faced official charges this week. 
Remes, who was agriculture minister for six months between April and October 2007, allegedly abused his office and accepted bribes to help a businessman obtain a lucrative government contract. 
He allegedly received the bribes through the efforts of one of his predecessors, Muresan. 
Brussels has warned that Romania lags in the investigation and punishment of high-level corruption.

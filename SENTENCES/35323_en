ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul met with his Dutch counterpart, Atzo Nicolai, on Tuesday (20 April). 
The two ministers discussed the upcoming referendum in Cyprus, Turkey's EU membership bid and the necessary reforms to be made along the way. 
Commenting on Saturday's twin referenda on the UN-sponsored plan to reunify Cyprus, Nicolai said that if Greek Cypriots rejected the plan, the EU would work to prevent northern Cyprus from falling into isolation after the southern part of the island joins the Union next month. 
Asked about Turkey's EU membership prospects, Nikolai said predictions must wait until a date is set for starting accession negotiations, which is expected in December.

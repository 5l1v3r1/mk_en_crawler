ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis urged the government Wednesday (13 November) to take a calm and pragmatic approach in assessing UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan to resolve the Cyprus question, calling it possibly the last chance for a solution.
But Dervis Eroglu, prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, was sceptical, saying that the plan is unclear in regards to the sovereignty of the future states, and that it demands serious compromises on property and territorial issues.
He wants more time to study the document.
Annan had asked the parties to respond by 18 November.

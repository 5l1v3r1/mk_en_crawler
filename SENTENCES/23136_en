ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said on Tuesday (April 1st) that the judicial system needs reforming. 
A day earlier, the Constitutional Court agreed to hear a lawsuit against the ruling Justice and Development Party that aims to close the party down for allegedly threatening secularism.
"We have achieved a lot in the economy, in the process of the country's democratisation, but it is clear that we have a lot of work to do reforming our judiciary," Babacan told an international conference in Istanbul. 
Speaking at the same event, the co-chairman of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, Joost Lagendijk, warned that the lawsuit will impede Turkey's progress on its road to the EU.

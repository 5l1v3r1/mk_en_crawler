SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Washington has no specific plan or proposals for progress in BiH, because decisions regarding the future are in the hands of local political leaders, US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said in Sarajevo on Friday (February 25th).
During his visit, he met with several politicians, including the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union of BiH Dragan Covic, the leader of HDZ 1990 Bozo Ljubic, Party of Democratic Action leader Sulejman Tihic and Social Democratic Party leader Zlatko Lagumdzija.
The officials discussed the slow pace of forming a new government, nearly five months after elections.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The Eastern High Court in Copenhagen acquitted on Monday (March 10th) Elias Ibn Hsain, a 19-year-old Dane of Moroccan origin, of involvement in a terror case in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
This is his second acquittal on terrorism charges.
Prosecutors had re-opened the case after finding what they described as stronger evidence of his involvement with two other suspects, already convicted in BiH of planning a terrorist attack on an unidentified target in Europe.
The two Muslims -- one a Bosnian-Swedish national, the other of Danish-Turkish origin -- were arrested in 2005 when police raided a Sarajevo apartment.

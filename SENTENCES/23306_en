NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The only way towards a settlement is to continue direct talks with the Turkish Cypriot community, despite difficulties faced in the negotiations process, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said on Saturday (December 27th). 
"There is no road to a solution other than negotiations. 
Stagnation and the absence of dialogue favour those seeking division," the president told a student conference in Nicosia. 
He warned a possible withdrawal from the talks would be "destructive", as it would give the impression Greek Cypriots are not interested in finding a solution.
In other news Saturday, Cypriot Parliament Speaker Marios Karoyan said Turkey shows no determination in resolving the matter. 
"So far, the Turkish side has not shown any sign of good will and remained intransigent in seeking a two-state solution instead of the proposed bi-zonnal, bi-communal federation," Karoyan said.

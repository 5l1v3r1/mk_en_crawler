GENEVA, Switzerland -- The 144 members of the WTO voted Tuesday (15 October) to admit Macedonia as a member. 
WTO Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi and Macedonian Economy Minister Besnik Fetai signed an agreement that would enable the Balkan nation to join the international trade body 30 days after the deal is ratified by the parliament in Skopje. 
As a WTO member, Macedonia would enjoy preferential trade status among all fellow member countries. 
Membership is also a requirement for EU integration. 
Panitchpakdi praised the agreement, saying it would create "a more predictable environment for business, trade and investment" in Macedonia. 
Another official described it as Macedonia's most significant step since signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

TIRANA, Albania -- Several NGOs held a rally in Tirana on Friday (April 13th), calling on the government to stop what they described as continued pressure on the media.
The demonstration was organised in part by the MJAFT!
Movement and supported by the left-wing opposition.
In other news, the government has adopted a decision that would result in the distribution of new identity documents to Albanian citizens beginning in January 2008.
The project is aimed at fulfilling the EU requirements for identity documents' security.

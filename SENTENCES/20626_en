THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Vojislav Seselj, leader of Serbia's nationalist Radical Party, challenged the UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (November 8th) to sentence him to life in prison.
In a lengthy opening statement, Seselj said he wished the court had a death sentence, as this would make him even more of a martyr in Serbia.
He said he had created a "new ideology", which would only be enhanced by the severity of any sentence he receives at The Hague.
He also described himself as a victim, targeted for his ideology rather than for actual crimes.
Prosecutors say Seselj was part of a joint criminal enterprise -- together with Slobodan Milosevic and others -- that worked to create a Greater Serbia by expelling members of other ethnic groups form large parts of the former Yugoslavia.
Some call him the father of ethnic cleansing.
He is charged with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes.

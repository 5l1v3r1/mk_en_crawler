SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak offered a new concept for police reform during a meeting Wednesday (August 29th) with four leading politicians -- Haris Silajdzic of the SBiH, Nebojsa Radmanovic of the SNSD, and PDP members Dragan Covic and Mladen Ivanic.
Lajcak reportedly discussed it with each politician separately.
He declined to go public with details, out of concern that media speculation might affect the negotiations.
All four politicians also declined to comment, saying they will need several days to study the five-page draft.
On Thursday, Lajcak will meet with leaders of the SDA, HDZ 1990 and SDP.
Police reform is a prerequisite for initialling a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.

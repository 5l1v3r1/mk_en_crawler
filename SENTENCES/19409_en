BELGRADE, Serbia -- The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) rejected calls by nationalists to boycott foreign banks.
"All banks that operate on the Serbian banking market are local banks regardless of the source of their capital," the NBS said in a statement on Friday (February 22nd).
Several branches of banks with headquarters in counties that recognise Kosovo's independence were vandalised in last week's Belgrade riots.

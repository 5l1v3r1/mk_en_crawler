LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- The country's EU affairs parliamentary committee unanimously backed on Monday (September 28th) lifting the blockade on 11 negotiating chapters at Croatia's EU accession conference, scheduled for Friday. 
The decision concerns the opening of six chapters and the closure of another five. 
The voting, held behind closed doors, came shortly before the start of parliamentary debates on Slovenia's decision to unblock Zagreb's EU accession talks, as well as on the solution to the border dispute between the two countries, requested by the opposition.

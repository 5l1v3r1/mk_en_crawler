SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, the chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia, has rescheduled for Wednesday (23 March) a meeting of main party leaders that failed to materialise Tuesday due to ongoing disputes.
The meeting is aimed at preventing irregularities in Sunday's second round of local elections that cropped up in some municipalities during the first round on 13 March.
In other news, Buckovski visits Bulgaria on Wednesday.
Talks will focus on bilateral issues, as well as Bulgaria's support for Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration bid.

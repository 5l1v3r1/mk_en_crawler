ANKARA, Turkey -- The Turkish Parliament may convene for a session in September to discuss the issue of sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday (7 August). 
Erdogan added, however, that the session would be held only if a political consensus on the issue is reached first.

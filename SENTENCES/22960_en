BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Croatia will not be able to join the EU earlier than 2011, Hannes Swoboda, rapporteur for Croatia in the European Parliament (EP), said on Wednesday (June 4th).
During a discussion in Brussels of Croatia's efforts, Swoboda said that should accession negotiations end in the middle of next year at the earliest, it would coincide with the election of a new EP and a new European Commission.
This would considerably delay the adoption of a position on Croatia's accession and its accession treaty, leaving no time to ratify the treaty.
Thus, he said, ratification would likely occur in 2010, moving membership to 2011 at the earliest.
Zagreb hopes to join by 2010.

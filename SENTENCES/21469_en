NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat met on Friday (May 23rd) in a bid to give renewed impetus to the process of uniting the divided island. 
They reviewed the progress made by working groups tasked to prepare for talks but failed to come up with a timetable for future negotiations. 
Still, a joint statement issued later praised the "genuine and fruitful discussions" between the two sides. 
Christofias and Talat reaffirmed their commitment to a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with political equality, as defined by UN Security Council resolutions.
Christofias' predecessor, Tassos Papadopoulos, reacted harshly to the statement Sunday, describing it as one step back for Greek Cypriots. 
Christofias and Talat first met in March shortly after Christofias' election as president and decided to revive the reunification. 
Cyprus has been divided since 1974.

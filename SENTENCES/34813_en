TIRANA, Albania -- Four high-ranking officers, including a deputy director of customs, were fired by Albania's customs administration, local press reported on Wednesday (6 August). 
The layoffs were prompted by financial misappropriations that have resulted in a $17m deficit in the customs budget. 
The head of the Customs Committee for the Fight Against Smuggling was also laid off.

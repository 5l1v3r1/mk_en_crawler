TEHRAN, Iran -- Iranian gas exports to Turkey resumed on Sunday (September 5th) nearly two weeks after a blast damaged the pipeline connecting the two countries. 
An August 25th explosion, believed to have been caused by members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), damaged the facility and forced it to close for repairs. 
A similar blast on July 21st hit another section of the pipeline by the town of Dogubayazit, near the border with Iran. 
It took ten days to repair the facility and get gas flowing again that time.

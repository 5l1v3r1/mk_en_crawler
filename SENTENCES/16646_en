ATHENS, Greece -- The government is considering whether to enable ethnic Greeks from Albania to obtain Greek citizenship, it became clear after Tuesday's (November 7th) session of the so-called "inner cabinet" commission in Athens.
The panel, chaired by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and including foreign and interior ministers Dora Bakoyannis and Prokopis Pavlopoulos, decided that members of the ethnic Greek minority -- predominantly in southern Albania -- would be able to qualify for Greek citizenship under certain terms.
Bakoyannis and Pavlopoulos noted that the procedure could start immediately, as the Albanian Constitution allows dual citizenship.

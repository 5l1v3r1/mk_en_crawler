THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal will deliver its verdict Thursday (June 10th) against seven Bosnian Serb officers suspected of genocide or crimes against humanity in Srebrenica in 1995.
Vujadin Popovic, Ljubisa Beara, Drago Nikolic, Ljubomir Borovcanin and Vinko Pandurevic are charged with genocide, while Radivoje Miletic and Milan Gvero stand accused of crimes against humanity.
Prosecutors demand life in prison for all defendants, while defence lawyers insist the charges have not been proven.

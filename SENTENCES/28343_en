BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc on Tuesday (July 13th) banned all ministers from speaking publicly about issues that have not been discussed and approved by the government. 
His move was in response to earlier statements by Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu, who said in an interview with Ziarul Financiar that the government should introduce a progressive income tax in 2011, since the flat tax was not generating enough revenue, especially in light of the GDP decline this year and uncertain prospects for 2011. 
Boc says Vladescu was not authorised to publicly discuss the flat tax or the introduction of a progressive tax, adding this important political issue should not be decided in a newspaper.

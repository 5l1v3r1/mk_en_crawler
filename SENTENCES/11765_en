ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament went on summer recess Friday (15 July) after passing a key pension reform law.
It provides for the establishment of pensioners' funds, which would seek to resolve the issue of excessive state debt to pensioners, accumulated in the post-war years.
The legislature convenes again in September.

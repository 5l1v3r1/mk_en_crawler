SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The State Election Commission (SEC) confirmed late Tuesday (15 March) that there would be a 27 March run-off in the race for Skopje mayor between incumbent Risto Penov of the ruling For Macedonia Together coalition and challenger Trifun Kostovski, an independent candidate backed by the opposition. 
SEC chairman Stevo Pendarovski said neither won an outright victory in the first round Sunday. 
The opposition, insisting Kostovski won over 50 per cent in the first round, has threatened to organise protests. 
The ruling coalition meanwhile blamed the opposition for trying to manipulate the election results and the SEC for acting non-transparently and slowly.
In other news, the interior ministry said Wednesday that it had extradited former security official Johan Tarculovski to The Hague. 
He and former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski have been charged with war crimes stemming from the 2001 conflict.

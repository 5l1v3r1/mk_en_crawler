TIRANA, Albania -- Ruling Democratic Party's (DP) deputy leader Edi Paloka asked parliament Thursday (May 15th) to allow the prosecutor general to reopen all corruption cases linked to state officials.
"Immunity should be lifted as a measure against corruption, but we also call for the opening of all corruption files at the prosecutors' office," Paloka said.
The opposition Socialist Party (SP) meanwhile boycotted the session at which the majority discussed two economy-related draft laws.
The Socialists say they will continue their boycott until Prime Minister Sali Berisha reports to parliament on the deadly March 15th Gerdec ammunition blasts, corruption and the assets of public officials.
In other news, effective on July 1st, the government plans to boost salaries above inflation levels.
"We will double salaries over a period of four years;
on July 1st we will increase salaries by much more than the inflation rate in a bid to offer support to consumers," Finance Minister Ridvan Bode said on Thursday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The foreign ministry reported Sunday (7 December) that the country would sign the UN convention for corruption fighting. 
Justice Minister Ingrid Anticevic-Marinovic travels to Mexico on Monday to sign the document.
In other news, Mate Granic, the leader of the Democratic Centre, resigned Sunday due to the party's poor performance in last month's general elections.

Meanwhile, President Stipe Mesic is expected to nominate Croatian Democratic Union leader Ivo Sanader as prime minister designate Monday or Tuesday, with a 30-day mandate for forming the new government.

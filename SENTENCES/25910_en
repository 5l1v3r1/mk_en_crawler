ATHENS, Greece -- Prosecutors filed charges Wednesday (November 18th) against six people for unrest that broke out during protests marking the 1973 anti-junta student revolt in Athens.
Five of the suspects are charged with violating public order, and the sixth is charged with illegal weapons possession.
All have been released pending further proceedings.
One of the suspects is the grandson of Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, an ardent opponent of the junta.
Police used tear gas and arrested over 200 people during Tuesday's riots.

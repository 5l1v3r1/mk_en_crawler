FOCA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- State Investigation and Protection Agency officers on Tuesday (February 12th) arrested a man referred to as "MN" on suspicion of crimes against humanity committed in Foca during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Local media reports identify him as Miodrag Nikacevic, an employee of the Traffic Safety Department at Foca's Public Safety Centre. 
Nikacevic was reportedly a commander of a 50-member unit during the 1990s.
In other news, the BiH Prosecution Office offered a 50,000-euro reward for information about a robbery at the Sarajevo Airport. 
In December, four men in police uniforms made off with 1.3m euros. 
Prosecutors said the reward is being provided by an international insurance company that owned the stolen money.

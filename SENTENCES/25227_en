BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers will begin discussing a draft resolution Tuesday (March 30th) condemning crimes committed in Srebrenica in July 1995. 
The document was submitted by 114 lawmakers from the ruling coalition. 
In addition to condemning the 1995 Srebrenica crimes against Bosniaks -- as confirmed by the International Court of Justice -- it says Belgrade expects other former Yugoslav republics to condemn crimes committed against Serbs. 
The draft does not mention the term "genocide" due to the objections of some coalition members and opposition parties.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged Serbia to maintain a pro-European course and step up progress towards EU membership.
Spokeswoman Christina Gallach said on Monday (January 21st) that the high turnout in Sunday's presidential elections suggests voters recognised the importance of elections.
Tomislav Nikolic, deputy leader of the ultra-nationalistic Serb Radical Party, won the first round and will face incumbent Boris Tadic, Serbia's pro-EU reform-oriented leader of the Democratic Party in a runoff on February 3rd.
Campaigning in Novi Sad, Tadic warned on Monday that Nikolic could lead Serbia back to isolation.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic echoed that sentiment Monday during a visit to Athens.
"The most critical decision that Serbia is going to be making in the next few weeks is which path to take," the minister said.
He also said that Serbia wants to sign a pre-membership agreement with the EU as soon as possible.
As for Kosovo, Jeremic insisted that the UN should determine the mandate of any EU mission deployed to the province.
Brussels is preparing to send a mission of about 1,600 administrators, police, and justice officials to Pristina to take over the job of monitoring Kosovo from the UN.
Jeremic also insisted that there was still room for talks between the leaders of the province's ethnic Albanians and Belgrade.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis agreed, saying "The potential for effective diplomacy has not been exhausted." (Blic, Danas - 22/01/08;

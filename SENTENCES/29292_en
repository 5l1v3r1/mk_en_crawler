ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court decided on Thursday (June 3rd) to continue a review of a constitutional amendments case, resuming its session next Tuesday, according to an official announcement. 
The application was filed by the Republican Peoples' Party (CHP), the largest opposition formation, which has challenged the recently approved constitutional amendments on the basis of both procedure and contents. 
The CHP argues that at least three of the 27 articles violate the spirit of the current constitution. 
If the Constitutional Court decides those arguments holds water, then it will review the case on the grounds of contents. 
However, many lawyers and the ruling Justice and Development Party argue that the Court cannot review the contents of constitutional amendments, only the procedure under which they were approved. 
If the Court decides against the amendments, it might nullify a referendum on the constitutional reform package scheduled for September 12th.

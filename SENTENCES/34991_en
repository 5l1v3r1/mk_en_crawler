ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament decided Wednesday (10 December) to lift a ban on information about the work and personnel of the country's top advisory body, the National Security Council.
The move was seen as a response to EU calls for greater transparency in Turkish politics and for curbing the army's role in the decision-making process.
In other news, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek promised that the government would revise proposed amendments to the Criminal Code.
EU representative to Ankara Hans-Joerg Kretschmer had described the draft as a setback for the entire democratisation process and discredited Turkey's efforts to join the Union.
Also Wednesday, Turkey became one of the first countries to sign the UN Convention Against Corruption.
The ceremony was held in Merida, Mexico.

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived late on Tuesday (March 29th) for a landmark visit to Iraq's northern Kurdish region.
In the regional capital Arbil, he attended the inauguration ceremony of a new airport, which was built by a Turkish company.
Speaking at the event, Erdogan said Turkey has "laid the foundations for a brotherhood among peoples â¦ on the basis of economic development", stressing the country has ended its old policy "which denied the very human nature of people".
Erdogan met with Kurdish regional President Masoud Barzani, who described the visit as an "historic event," adding, "Turkey now has a major position in the region and this is because of your wise policies.
We hope that these developments will continue after the next Turkish [general] elections [in June]." Before arriving in northern Iraq, Erdogan and other Turkish officials met Grad Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's Shiites' spiritual leader.

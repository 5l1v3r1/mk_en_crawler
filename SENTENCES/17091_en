SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The country's special services have smashed a ring that was smuggling cigarettes to Western Europe via Bulgaria, the interior ministry announced on Sunday (October 1st).
Late last week, Bulgarian authorities seized smuggled cigarettes worth a total of 3m euros from two lorries with Russian registration plates.
They had arrived at the Bourgas port by ferry from Russia.
The ministry is trying to determine if the late crime boss Ivan Todorov was involved.
He was gunned down in Sofia in February.

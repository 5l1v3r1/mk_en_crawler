BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Emil Boc officially announced on Thursday (September 2nd) that after discussions with leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), six cabinet ministers will be replaced. 
They are Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu, Agriculture Minister Mihail Dumitru, Transport Minister Radu Berceanu, Communication Minister Gabriel Sandu, Labour Minister Mihai Seitan, and Economy Minister Adriean Videanu. 
The reshuffle was sparked by the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) and National Liberal Party (PNL) announcing plans to file a no-confidence motion against Boc's cabinet by year's end. 
The opposition wants to reverse a 5% hike in the VAT and a 25% cut in public wages. 
The PSD and the PNL control 214 of the 471 seats in parliament. 
The new cabinet appointees will require President Traian Basescu's approval.

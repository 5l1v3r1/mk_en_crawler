TIRANA, Albania -- Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta asked leaders Thursday (December 17th) of the two largest political parties -- the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) -- to start a dialogue and find a solution to the ongoing political stalemate.
Meta, head of the Socialist Movement for Integration, the junior party in the coalition, says rhetoric must be put aside and that co-operation is necessary for the good of EU integration.
The SP insists it will continue its boycott of parliament until its allegations of manipulations in the June general elections are investigated.

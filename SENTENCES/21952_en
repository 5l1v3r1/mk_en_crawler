TIRANA, Albania -- The Legality Movement Party (LMP) has proposed including the Albanian diaspora in future elections, so their representatives can serve in parliament. 
"We suggest that the new Elections Code create a special zone for all Albanians living in diaspora, from where also deputy candidates will derive," Ekrem Spahia, head of LMP said on Sunday (May 18th). 
He added their "right to vote has a special value since our country has high immigration, consisting of more than one million persons." (TopChannel, BalkanWeb - 17/05/08)

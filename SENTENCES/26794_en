BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU foreign ministers begin meeting on Monday (December 7th) to discuss the upcoming European Council and the 27-nation bloc's eventual enlargement.
Serbia hopes to get its interim trade agreement with the EU unblocked, following a positive report by The Hague war crimes tribunal's Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz.
The EU's decision depends on the Netherlands, which has been opposing Belgrade's further integration unless it proves full war crimes co-operation.
The EU foreign ministers will also discuss the EC recommendation for starting membership talks with Macedonia, and will discuss Turkey's EU bid.
On Kosovo, they are expected to urge Pristina to boost co-operation with EULEX and support the mission's efforts in terms of rule of law, and fighting corruption and organised crime.

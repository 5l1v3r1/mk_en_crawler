BUCHAREST, Romania -- Parliament rejected on Wednesday (22 June) a no-confidence motion against the coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu. 
The opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) filed the initiative last week, citing failures in the EU accession process, particularly the government's recent bills on judicial and property reforms.
Also Wednesday, authorities announced the arrest of Francesco Perspicace, the former boss of an Italian mafia group. 
The suspected head of one of Europe's biggest narcotics smuggling rings, Perspicace reportedly entered Romania using a forged passport two months ago. 
He will be extradited to Italy.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Russian power utility company Inter RAO reportedly is interested in building a second nuclear plant in Bulgaria, Mardik Papazyan, CEO of Bulgaria's national electricity company, NEK, announced on Wednesday (May 27th). 
Reportedly, Inter RAO is leading talks with RWE, Germany's largest energy firm, on acquiring a 24.5% stake in the project. 
RWE was chosen as a strategic partner of the Bulgarian government and will receive 49% of the project. 
The state will keep 2%.
In other news, a bus slammed into a crowd of pedestrians in southeastern Bulgaria on Thursday, killing at least 16 people and injuring 20. 
Police say the driver apparently lost control after the vehicle's brakes failed while travelling down a mountain pass near Yambol. 
The victims had been walking up the peak to attend a traditional Ascension Day feast and fair. 
On Friday, the country will observe a day of mourning.

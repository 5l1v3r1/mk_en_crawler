ATHENS, Greece -- A major explosion damaged vehicles near the home of Greek Culture Minister George Voulgarakis, but caused no injuries. 
According to police, Voulgarakis was at home and getting ready to go to work when the bomb went off Tuesday (30 May) morning. 
Authorities believe that he was the target of the attack. 
Voulgarakis was minister of public order, Greece's top security official, before a cabinet reshuffle in February.

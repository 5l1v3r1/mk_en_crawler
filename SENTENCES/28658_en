ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament approved on Tuesday (October 12th) a one-year extension of a cross-border military operation mandate that was due to expire on October 17th. 
The mandate, allowing the army to conduct strikes against Kurdish rebels in neighbouring Iraq, was first granted in 2007 and has been extended twice -- in 2008 and 2009. 
The approval came during a closed-door parliamentary session, at which the government briefed lawmakers on efforts to find a resolution to the decades-long conflict with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
The vast majority of lawmakers supported the extension, though as expected, the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party objected to it.

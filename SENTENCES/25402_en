SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two top officials with the Bosnian soccer federation were sentenced on Monday (November 23rd) to five years in prison for tax evasion and abuse of office between 2001 and 2005. 
Federation Secretary-General Munib Usanovic and Finance and Marketing Secretary Miodrag Kures were found guilty of evading taxes due on products and services, as well as embezzling federation funds. 
"The two evaded a total of [157,536 euros] in taxes and abused office by misappropriating 169,683 euros without a valid reason and proper documentation, and thus obtaining personal gain," the court said.

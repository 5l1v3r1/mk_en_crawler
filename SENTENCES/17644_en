BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister in charge of EU integration Bozidar Djelic said on Wednesday (July 25th) that Serbia may be given EU candidate status by the end of 2008 if it demonstrates the necessary political will. 
As a step in this direction, Serbia hopes to have its name added to the Schengen White List, Djelic said. 
On January 1st, an agreement easing the visa regime with the EU will come into force, allowing certain categories of people â including students, journalists, and experts in various fields -- to receive visas for EU member states amid fewer restrictions.
Djelic also said Serbia's integration process and resolving Kosovo's final status are two separate issues.

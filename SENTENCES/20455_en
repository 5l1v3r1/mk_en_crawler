MUNICH, Germany -- US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said he believes that while Russia opposes independence for Kosovo, it will react with maturity once it is declared.
"My view, and this is only my personal view, is that the Russians will ...
react cautiously," Gates told journalists Saturday (February 9th) on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich.
He added however he does not "expect Moscow to make big noise".
At the same forum, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov warned that Europe could open a "Pandora's box" if it recognised a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo.
Ivanov explained that Kosovo could set an important international precedent.
He insisted that if EU countries recognise Kosovo, they should recognise the independence of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as well.
Also in Munich, EU security chief Javier Solana said on Sunday that a decision regarding the operational plan for an EU mission to Kosovo is expected soon.
He insisted the mission is the only way the EU can fulfil its obligation to help stabilise the region.

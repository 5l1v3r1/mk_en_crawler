BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Banja Luka daily Nezavisne novine published in its Wednesday (10 August) edition a full-page declaration from a local association, urging wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to surrender to The Hague tribunal.
The call -- the first of its kind to be published in the local press -- was signed by an organisation named the Society for Modern Politics.
It echoed the recent appeal by Karadzic's wife, Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic, who urged her husband to surrender, to "save" himself and his family.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Ashraf Ahmad Jum'a, a Palestinian doctor who was released on July 24th along with five Bulgarian nurses after eight years in a Libyan jail, plans to file a complaint against Libya at the UN's Human Rights Council, his lawyer announced on Tuesday (August 7th). 
His suit will charge Libya with torture, delayed proceedings and abuse of evidence. 
The doctor, who is now a Bulgarian citizen, also intends to sue the police officers who allegedly tortured him.
Meanwhile, one of the nurses, Snezhana Dimitrova, went on BTV on Tuesday to deny reports she plans to sue Bulgaria and seek compensation for the years spent in Libyan jails. 
She instead thanked Bulgaria, the EU and France for efforts to win her release.

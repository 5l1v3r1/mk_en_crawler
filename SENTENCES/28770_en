BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers met in Brussels on Saturday (September 11th) to discuss relations with Turkey.
The informal talks aimed to recognise that although Turkey is not a member of the EU family yet, it is "a partner with us in lots of issues around the world", EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said.
She met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu late Friday to discuss relations between Ankara and the bloc.
Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb described Turkey as arguably "more influential in the world than any of our member states together or separately".
He added "It has a great influence in the Middle East, in the African Horn, in the Persian Gulf, in Iran.
It's a truly global player and we need to work together with Turkey right now on foreign and security policy."
After the meeting, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt criticised countries that want to block accession talks with Turkey.
"'It is, of course, fundamentally unacceptable that countries -- for their own political reasons -- block the accession process.
That is contrary to the spirit of Europe," Bildt said.

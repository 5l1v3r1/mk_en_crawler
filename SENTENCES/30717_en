SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU should take the leading role in BiH this year, allowing the Office of the High Representative to withdraw from domestic politics and focus on reviewing past decisions, the International Crisis Group said in its latest report released on Tuesday (January 11th). 
"Today the country needs EU technical assistance and political guidance to become a credible candidate for EU membership, not an international overseer to legislate for it or maintain security," the report said. 
The organisation suggested that member states should step up the EU's presence, even as BiH's political parties struggle to form entity and state-level governments, three months after general elections were held.

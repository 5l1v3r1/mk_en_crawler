WASHINGTON, United States -- The Macedonian people made a courageous choice when they decided to continue on the course set by the Ohrid Peace Accords, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday (8 November). 
A referendum on the country's new decentralisation laws failed Sunday due to low voter turnout. 
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana also praised the result, saying the public voted to move towards EU membership. 
He visits Skopje on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski has called a meeting Wednesday of the leaders of all political parties and ethnic communities. 
He says he wants them to "express the political will" to continue on the path towards EU and NATO integration.
The OSCE on Monday said the referendum generally met international standards. 
The ethnic Albanian bloc in Macedonia said the results suggest voters were unwilling to revisit the past.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- A team of UN doctors is expected in Croatia next week to determine if former Army Chief of Staff Janko Bobetko is fit to stand trial for war crimes, the government announced on Friday (10 January).
The 84-year-old retired general was hospitalized soon after the UN tribunal unsealed his indictment.
Croatian doctors are maintaining that he is in critical condition and cannot attend court proceedings.

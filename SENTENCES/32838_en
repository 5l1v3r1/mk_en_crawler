ALEXANDROUPOLIS, Greece -- The mayor of Bulgaria's southeast town of Kardjali, Rumen Dimitrov, arrived in Alexandroupolis Monday (3 February) to discuss joint projects under the EU's PHARE programme with the prefect of Evros, Nicolaos Zabounidis.
The EU is to grant financing to two projects for the purification of the Arda River for a total of 855,000 euros.
Zabounidis said local governments in both Bulgaria and Greece were interested in environmental protection of border regions.
However, he said in order for Bulgaria to be eligible to apply for EU financing, it would have to convince all border municipalities to enter the project.
The two officials also discussed the establishment of a joint industrial zone at the Greek-Bulgarian border, which would provide tax benefits to the companies that wish to invest in it.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government has approved the declaration on Kosovo and will submit it to parliament for debate, according to Vojislav Kostunica, the leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS).
Kostunica also serves as chairman of the Povratak Coalition, which established the working group that drafted the declaration.
The text incorporated the guidelines on Kosovo-Metohija drafted by Nebojsa Covic, the head of the co-ordinating centre, with proposals by the cabinet and DSS.
In other news, Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi criticised the idea of including Kosovo in the new Serbian Constitution, saying it only hindered dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo went further, and has asked Kosovo authorities to address the subject with the UN Security Council and the European Commission.

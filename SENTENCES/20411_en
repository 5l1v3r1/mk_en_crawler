BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry on Saturday (October 13th) accused Chisinau of a "hostile act" after eight Romanian citizens were barred from entering Moldova the previous day.
They were heading to a religious celebration in the Moldovan capital but were stopped at the border because they did not bring copies of their original invitations.
Romanian citizens normally do not need visas or invitations to enter Moldova.

Foreign Minister Adrian Cioroianu said Moldova should understand its road to European integration should not be built on offences against Romanian citizens.
Two-thirds of Moldova's 4.2 million citizens are Romanians.

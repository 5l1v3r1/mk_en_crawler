SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Parliament on Wednesday (23 February) endorsed the cabinet changes proposed by Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg earlier this week. 
Milko Kovachev, formerly energy minister, is the new economy minister. 
Miroslav Sevlievski, of the new ruling coalition partner New Time, will take over as energy minister. 
Nihat Kabil becomes agriculture minister, while Nina Chilova will head the newly established ministry of culture and tourism. 
The opposition has criticised the changes, saying they are merely the result of political bargaining.

TIRANA, Albania -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso is praising measures the government has undertaken against organised crime that recently resulted in hundreds of arrests.
Local press reports Monday (8 May) cited a statement by Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who said Brussels welcomed the country's determination to crack down on organised crime, a condition of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Berisha says his government has succeeded in cutting the link between politics and organised crime, adding there would be no amnesty for any member of government or parliament with links to criminal circles.

BERN, SWITZERLAND -- Council of Europe (CoE) rapporteur Dick Marty, the author of a report that accuses incumbent Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of involvement in organ trafficking, said on Friday (December 17th) that many countries were aware of facts related to the case. 
"Numerous reports of the intelligence services, the German, British, Italian, and Greek ones, as well as reports of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were sent to various foreign ministries," Marty said in an interview with the Swiss daily Le Temps. 
"They, however, gave priority to diplomatic policy, perhaps because they felt that the past should be left behind."
Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who served as the first head of UNMIK, said he doubted Marty's claims that the international community was aware of the organ trafficking. 
In an interview with the BBC, he called for an international investigation to be headed by EULEX.
Meanwhile, former ICTY prosecutor Carla del Ponte is also urging EULEX to carry out an investigation. 
In an interview published by Swiss media, she called on the EU, the United States and other countries to provide the necessary political and material support for the probe and to "bring to court all those suspected of being involved in these crimes". 
A book by del Ponte published in 2008 raised allegations of organ trafficking in Kosovo and Albania.

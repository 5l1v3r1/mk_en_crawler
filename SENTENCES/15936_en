NEW YORK, United States -- NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer urged Serbia on Tuesday (19 September) to show concrete results in its co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, stressing that an action plan is no substitute for real action.
His comment came during a meeting with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, held within the framework of the UN General Assembly in New York.
In other news Tuesday, the UN tribunal confirmed that chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte will visit Serbia on 2 or 3 October.
She is expected to present a report to the EU regarding Serbia's co-operation in the middle of October.
Brussels will use the findings to determine whether to resume the Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations process, suspended over Serbia's failure to hand over top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic (Blic, Danas - 20/09/06;

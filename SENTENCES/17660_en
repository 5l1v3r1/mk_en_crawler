PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Parliament on Monday (March 26th) began discussing the new draft constitution, necessitated by the country's independence from its union with Serbia last year. 
The deputies are expected to debate some 40 proposed amendments concerning the definitions of state, language, state symbols and religions. 
Assembly Speaker Ranko Krivokapic said on Monday that since about 85% of the draft provisions were co-ordinated, he expects debate to lead to consensus on the rest. 
It would then be subject to public debate.

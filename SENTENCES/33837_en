TIRANA, Albania -- Political tensions stemming from last month's local elections are hurting the Stabilisation and Association Process, according to the head of the OSCE presence in Albania, Osmo Lipponen.
He said Tuesday (18 November) that the political crisis has lasted too long, citing also a slow reform progress, judiciary system problems and an inadequate fight against organised crime.
He will present a report Wednesday to the OSCE Permanent Council in Austria.

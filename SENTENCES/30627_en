BELGRADE, Serbia -- Turbo-folk diva Svetlana Ceca Raznatovic will spend eight months under house arrest after a court in Belgrade approved her plea bargain with prosecutors Monday (May 9th).
According to the deal, Raznatovic must also pay a fine of 1.5m euros, in three instalments.
She agreed to plead guilty to misappropriating millions of euros while trading football players to foreign clubs from the Obilic club she headed.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the BBC on Sunday (23 November) that it was not certain that al-Qaeda was responsible for the recent attacks on British interests and on two synagogues in Istanbul. 
He noted, however, that there were religious motives behind the terrorist acts and called for a broader global war on terror. 
Erdogan also commented that, in view of the latest developments, Turkey's EU membership has become even more significant, as it could serve as a model for co-existence between Islam and democracy. 
At Istanbul's Anglican Christ Church, about 100 Christians and Muslims gathered Sunday to mourn the British and Turkish victims of Thursday's terrorist strikes.
On Monday meanwhile, the <I>Times</I> newspaper reported that Turkish and British investigators have focused on the remote town of Bingol in their search for the terrorist mastermind. 
At least two of the bombers and one other suspect came from that town. 
Turkish police reportedly seized computers and questioned suspects there Sunday. 
In all, 18 people are being held in connection with the blasts.

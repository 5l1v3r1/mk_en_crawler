ANKARA, Turkey -- The European Commission Ambassador to Ankara, Marc Pierini, reiterated on Wednesday (April 4th) that amending or annulling controversial Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code is a key issue in Turkey's EU accession bid. 
He stressed that the Union expects the country to harmonise domestic legislation with EU laws, and to apply those laws. 
The Union repeatedly has called on Ankara to change the article that makes insulting "Turkishness" a crime. 
Brussels says it restricts freedom of speech.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul returned from a trip to Germany on Wednesday and said he hopes talks on three more chapters of the acquis could begin by the end of Germany's EU Presidency in June. 
Talks had been suspended for months over Turkey's failure to implement a customs agreement that includes EU member Cyprus.

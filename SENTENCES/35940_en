PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri on Wednesday (14 January) invited Kosovo Serbs to participate in workgroups designing a plan to implement standards. 
Holkeri said it is in the best interest of Serbs to participate, as their own interests are at stake. 
Past invitations have been refused, but Kosovo Serbs are to make their final decision after discussing it with Belgrade's Co-ordinating Centre for Kosovo and Metohija representatives.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The date for signing an agreement over disbursement of an $8.5 billion loan to Turkey has not been determined, said Turkish State Minister Ali Babacan, who is visiting Washington this week. 
Local press reports, citing US administration officials, say the loan would be disbursed in four equal tranches, after completion of the sixth review of Turkey's stand-by agreement with the IMF. 
That will most likely take place in mid-October. 
Babacan reiterated that the loan is not linked to Turkey's decision on sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq. 
On a different note, he told a news conference Thursday (11 September) that Turkey's fast-growing population is not an obstacle to EU accession aspirations. 
Babacan said that the Union's population is getting older due to negative growth rates and that, within 10 or 15 years, the EU would need Turkey's younger population.

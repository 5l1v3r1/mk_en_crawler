SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The war crimes court in BiH asked Norway on Thursday (April 24th) to sanction two prisoners who refused to testify in a war crimes trial last week.
Vidoje Blagojevic and a protected witness, whose name was not revealed, were summoned to testify via video link in the trial of Bosnian Serb Milos Stupar, charged with war crimes and genocide stemming from the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Blagojevic is serving an 18-year prison sentence in Norway for the same crime.
No details about the second witness were available.
The two could incur fines for refusing to co-operate.

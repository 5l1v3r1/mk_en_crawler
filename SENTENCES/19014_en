BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- If the only issue is whether to retain the name "RS police", while the other police restructuring issues have been resolved, there should be no problem signing an agreement, says Doris Pack, head of the European Parliament's delegation for Southeast Europe. 
Visiting Banja Luka on Monday (April 2nd), she met with Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and said it is time for the various political parties to reconcile their differences and stop arguing over such small details.
In other news Monday, BiH's chief negotiator with the EU, Igor Davidovic, said he is confident the country could sign a Stabilisation and Associations Accord with the EU by July. 
He insisted that BiH is near the very end of the negotiation process.

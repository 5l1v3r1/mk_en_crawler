FAMAGUSTA, Cyprus -- Platform for Peace, a NGO working to reach a final peace settlement in divided Cyprus, organised a press conference Sunday (May 18th), where it issued an appeal to leaders of both communities. 
The event included three political parties and six trade unions, in an attempt to draw attention to the peace process. 
Khalil Pasha, spokesman for Platform for Peace, said any agreement should be decided by Cypriots, rather than political pundits, because the public should have a say about re-unification. 
Pasha also urged the leaders of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to be straightforward in talks about the island's future.

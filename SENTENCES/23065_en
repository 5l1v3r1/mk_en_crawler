SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The State Election Commission (SEC) rejected on Wednesday (July 2nd) lingering complaints related to the recent parliamentary elections.
The Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP) filed them after the second revote in several ethnic Albanian villages last Sunday.
The PDP now has two days to appeal the SEC's decision to the Supreme Court.
Otherwise, the election results will be final.
The interior ministry says it arrested 62 people and pressed charges against 171 over incidents and irregularities that marred the elections.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister-designate Nikola Gruevski is continuing talks on forming a new ruling coalition.
On Thursday, the VMRO-DPMNE leader meets with leaders of the Democratic Union of Integration, the Democratic Party of Albanians and the Party for a European Future.
Observers expect a new government by mid-July.

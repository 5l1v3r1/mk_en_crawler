SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva announced Thursday (11 March) that Macedonia would submit its application for EU membership to Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on 22 March in Dublin.
A ceremony for that purpose was originally scheduled for 26 February, but was postponed upon news of the plane crash that killed President Boris Trajkovski.
Ireland holds the rotating EU presidency.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Following a heated debate, members of parliament gave first-round approval to a constitutional amendment to lift the headscarf ban in universities early Thursday (February 7th). 
The main opposition secular Republican People's Party says the proposal violates Article 2 of the Constitution, which states that the Republic of Turkey is a secular country. 
Members of the ruling Justice and Development Party disagree, saying the move would actually strengthen secularism. 
The government has the backing of the opposition Nationalist Movement Party. 
Together, they have more than the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution.
To ease concerns, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that a loosening of the ban would be limited to universities and would not be expanded to high schools or public offices. 
A second -- and final -- round of voting is scheduled for Saturday.

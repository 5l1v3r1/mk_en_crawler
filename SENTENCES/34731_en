SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The president's adviser on defence security, Gen Miho Mihov, says Bulgaria is prepared to host NATO military bases.
That echoes earlier statements by other military officials that the country could provide the conditions necessary to establish bases for ground forces, the navy and the air force.
Mihov also said the country should take a firm position on NATO bases on its territory, adding that the population is becoming increasingly positive about the prospect.

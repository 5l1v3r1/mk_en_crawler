ANKARA, Turkey -- Government spokesman Cemil Cicek said Wednesday (19 March) that parliament would vote on a government decision to provide limited support to the United States in a military operation against neighbouring Iraq. 
"The motion we will present today will be to allow the transit of US military aircraft and Turkish soldiers to be deployed abroad," Cicek said, signaling the cabinet has sidetracked a request for the deployment of 62,000 US troops on Turkish soil. 
He added that the two countries have also agreed on a Turkish deployment of troops in northern Iraq, to set up a buffer zone and prevent a mass exodus of refugees. 
The announcement followed an unexpected meeting Tuesday between Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and his US counterpart, Donald Rumsfeld.

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said on Wednesday (November 15th) that it has agreed to hear a case filed against two members of the Turkish parliament, charged with hampering efforts to encourage Turks to give up weapons. 
The case was initiated by Turkish lawyer Tuncer Essizhan, who claims MPs Enver Yilmaz and Eyup Fatsa set a poor example by firing guns into the air at a wedding earlier this year. 
The incident was broadcast on television. 
Essizhan began campaigning for gun control after his young grandson was shot and killed three years ago.
In other news, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki began an official visit to Turkey on Thursday. 
The focus is on the fight against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party.

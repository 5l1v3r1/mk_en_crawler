ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan again dismissed the possibility of holding early parliamentary elections, stressing on Wednesday (December 13th) that the next vote would take place in November 2007, as scheduled. 
His remark was in response to media reports that President Ahmet Necdet Sezer recently suggested that the elections be held in April, before the presidential elections in May, due to what was described as the deteriorating political situation in Turkey.
In other news, British Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly plans to visit Turkey on Friday, following the summit of EU leaders in Brussels. 
Talks there will focus on Turkish-EU relations and the Cyprus issue.

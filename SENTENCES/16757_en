SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH's Lower House approved a declaration Wednesday (7 June), asking High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling to sanction Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik for recent comments suggesting the entity could hold an independence referendum similar to that in Montenegro. 
Dodik's remarks are a breach of the Dayton Agreement, the lawmakers said. 
Dodik, in turn, accused them of stifling free speech.
In other news Wednesday, the Office of the High Representative chided Serbia for arranging an official state visit without the full consent of relevant authorities. 
It was responding to Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic's announcement that a government delegation would visit Banja Luka to discuss Dodik's referendum proposal. 
Holding such a vote is out of the question, the OHR also said.

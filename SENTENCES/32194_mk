SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson said Tuesday (8 October) that the alliance has decided to keep its 780-strong force in Macedonia until 15 December. 
The decision is at the request of President Boris Trajkovski, who hinted that an even longer presence might be necessary to ensure a smooth transition to peace. 
The mandate of the current mission was to have expired on 26 October. 
The EU had planned to take over the mission after that date, but efforts were stalled by a dispute between Greece and Turkey.
In separate news, US Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns told Trajkovski that it was the alliance's long-term ambition to integrate his country into the Euro-Atlantic structures. 
He vowed continued support by the alliance if Skopje does not get an invitation to join NATO at the Prague summit in November.

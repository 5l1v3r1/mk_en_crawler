PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Ramush Haradinaj was re-elected leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), a partner in the provincial government, during a weekend AAK congress. 
The vote took place two months after the UN war crimes tribunal, which has indicted the former Kosovo prime minister, agreed to let him participate in politics again. 
Addressing delegates at the congress, Haradinaj said that the process of settling Kosovo's final status must proceed with respect for the will of all people. 
No one must feel like a winner or loser in the process, he added.

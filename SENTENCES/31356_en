BRUSSELS, Belgium/STRASBOURG, France -- High-ranking European officials hailed the adoption of the new federal charter Thursday (30 January) by the Serbian and Montenegrin parliaments. 
EU security chief Javier Solana described the moment as historic, saying that the adoption would pave the way towards making the concept of a joint state a reality. 
He noted that the high support in both parliaments bodes well for people's perception of the new state. 
Council of Europe Secretary General Walter Schwimmer also applauded the adoptions and implied that Yugoslavia would be better positioned to enter the organisation. 
A session of the Yugoslav legislature for voting on the charter and the accompanying law has not been scheduled yet, but adoption is expected within days.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) decided on Thursday (January 29th) to move forward with proposing 58 seats out of 240 in parliament be distributed through a majority vote.
The bill hasn't been officially submitted to parliament yet so no details are available.
President Georgi Parvanov first mentioned introducing a mixed electoral system about a year ago.
The existing system is proportional.

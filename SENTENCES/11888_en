BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana met with Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski in Brussels on Tuesday (15 February) and said reforms in Macedonia must be completed before any dates are set for membership in the Union. 
Macedonian officials repeatedly have voiced expectations that the country would receive official EU candidate status by the end of this year. 
To that end, Skopje officially submitted the answers to the EU questionnaire Monday. 
Local media reports noted that, for the first time, Solana used the constitutional name "Republic of Macedonia" in his statement Tuesday.
In Brussels, Buckovski also met with European Parliament President Josep Borell. 
They discussed establishment of a joint interparliamentary committee, which would work to boost Macedonia' EU bid and liberalise the visa regime for Macedonian citizens.

WASHINGTON, United States -- The US government has agreed to help Albania rid itself of 16 tonnes of chemical agents left over from the Cold War, State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said Friday (22 October). 
The assistance would be provided under the US government's Co-operative Threat Reduction Programme.
Also on Friday, Albanian Integration Minister Ermelinda Meksi announced the completion of the eighth round of technical talks under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Albania and the EU. 
The talks focused on trade liberalisation and electoral reform. 
Speaking to reporters in Tirana, European Commission envoy Reinhard Priebe said Albania's EU integration largely hinges on the latter issue.

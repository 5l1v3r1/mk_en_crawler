ANKARA, Turkey -- Hundreds gathered in Ankara for an unprecedented anti-government protest Tuesday (February 1st), waving flags, chanting slogans, and carrying bottles of beer and champagne. 
The action was spurred by the implementation of strict rules on the sale of alcohol. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he wants to protect young people from harmful habits.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Six people died and nine are missing in Suceava County after a new heavy storm battered northern Romania on Friday (30 June).
Local authorities say some 22 villages remain without electricity and many roads are blocked.
Over 400 people were evacuated from their homes.
Last week, torrential rains and floods claimed at least 12 lives in the same area.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, storms caused power outages and road closures in dozens of villages in the northwest, as well as in the southern Black Sea district of Bourgas.

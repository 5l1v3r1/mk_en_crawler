TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Ilir Meta urged the opposition Monday (December 21st) to contribute to Albania's EU integration process, insisting that their parliamentary boycott is hampering reforms.
"I hope that it is temporary," he added, as the opposition's support is necessary in the visa liberalisation process, in completing the EC questionnaire and all other processes that are part of EU integration.
The opposition Socialist Party has been boycotting parliament sessions since September, demanding an investigation into the June general elections.

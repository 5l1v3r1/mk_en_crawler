ZAGREB, Croatia -- On Wednesday (30 April), a court allowed the government to extradite to The Hague a man wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal. 
Ivica Rajic, 45, commanded a Bosnian Croat unit during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
He is accused of ordering his troops to attack the village of Stupni Do on 23 October 1993. 
At least 16 Muslim civilians were killed in the incident, while about 250 were forced to flee. 
Rajic's lawyers said they would appeal the ruling before the Supreme Court.
Also Wednesday, Croatian state leaders and members of the defence ministry attended a ceremony in Zagreb honouring Gen Janko Bobetko, who died on Tuesday at the age of 84. 
His funeral will be held Friday.

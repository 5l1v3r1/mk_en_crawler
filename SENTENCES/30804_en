STRASBOURG, France -- The EU could "take action" to end the crisis in Albania if the conflicting parties fail to agree to hold democratic elections as scheduled in May.
EU envoy for the political crisis there Miroslav Lajcak indicated on Thursday (February 10th) that the crisis could result in negative developments in Albania's EU integration, including stopping or suspending the integration process.
Lajcak was briefing the European Parliament's (EP) Delegation for Relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo on the situation in Albania.

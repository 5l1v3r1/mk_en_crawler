BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU plans to unveil a package of measures Wednesday (7 July) designed to stimulate economic growth in the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and bring the area out of isolation.
The Union will reportedly provide about 220m euros of financial aid over three years, in a bid to erase the gap between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots and contribute to the reunification of the island.

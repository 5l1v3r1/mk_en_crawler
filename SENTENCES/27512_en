BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU is ready to mobilise 200 border police officers to help Greece deal with illegal immigrants crossing from Turkey, the EU's Belgian presidency announced on Wednesday (October 27th).
The FRONTEX rapid intervention team will be the first deployed since its creation in 2007.
Belgian Interior Minister Annemie Turtelboom told journalists in Brussels that five Belgian border police officers are ready to go to Greece.
Germany says it will send 25 and confirmation from other countries is expected.
On Sunday, Athens asked the EU to deploy teams to guard its border with Turkey amid the growing number of immigrants seeking illegal entry into the EU.

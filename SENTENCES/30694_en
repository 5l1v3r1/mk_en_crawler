TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha signed an order Wednesday (April 6th) banning the use of public administration funds for campaigning, ahead of the May 8th local elections. 
Berisha signed the document at a cabinet meeting, thus marking a change in a practice criticised for years. 
Berisha said authorities should strictly monitor the funds to prevent money coming from central and local institutions from going to finance political rallies. 
Private donations are regulated by law.

BITOLA, Macedonia -- Bulgaria officially opened a consulate in Bitola on Wednesday (December 27th), serving residents there and in nine nearby towns. 
Bulgaria's EU accession next week prompted the move, since as an EU member, Bulgaria will have to introduce visas for its Balkan neighbours. 
Bitola Mayor Vladimir Taleski says that by the end of next year, Serbia, Montenegro and Ukraine will open consulates as well.

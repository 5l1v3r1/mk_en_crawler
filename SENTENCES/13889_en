BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu has unveiled a new set of measures to combat corruption. 
He told reporters on Friday (16 September) that the government plans to tighten requirements for setting up warehouses selling alcohol and oil products, which would reduce their number and make them easier to supervise. 
New rules for the licensing of gambling establishments and security firms would be adopted soon. 
The EU has warned Romania and Bulgaria that it could delay their accession by one year if they fail to accelerate the fight against crime and corruption.
In other news, President Traian Basescu toured several major US cities last week, urging increased investment in Romania.

CHISINAU, Moldova -- Interim Moldovan President Mihai Ghimpu announced on Thursday (September 17th) that he has signed a decree lifting visa requirements for Romanian citizens travelling to the country. 
The visas were introduced following violent demonstrations against the Communist Party's alleged rigging of the Moldovan elections in April. 
Former President Vladimir Voronin accused Romania of inciting the protests; Bucharest, however, denies any involvement.

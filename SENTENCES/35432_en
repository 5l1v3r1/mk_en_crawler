BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Romano Prodi reassured visiting Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov that his country would be judged on merit when it comes to deciding whether it will join the EU in 2007.
After a meeting Thursday (12 February), Prodi tried to allay fears that Bulgaria's accession might be delayed by Romania's current problems.
Sofia has so far closed 26 of 31 negotiation chapters with the European Commission, compared to 22 for Bucharest.
Emma Nicholson, the European Parliament rapporteur for Romania, has called on the Commission to suspend negotiations with Bucharest because of two recent scandals:
one involving adoptions abroad, the second involving public contracts.

MITROVICA, Kosovo -- An explosion shattered windows and damaged cars in the divided town of Mitrovica early Thursday (September 9th) but no injuries are reported, according to Belgrade-based RTS. 
The blast, near student dorms in the Serb-dominated north, reportedly targeted Kosovo police vehicles. 
It happened two days after a Kosovo Albanian was shot dead outside his house in northern Mitrovica.

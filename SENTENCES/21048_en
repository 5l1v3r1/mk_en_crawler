BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said on Thursday (August 2nd) that the country has made enormous efforts to restructure and build a state-level army, making the armed forces fully prepared for NATO membership.
After watching a joint military exercise between BiH and US forces at the Mahovljani airfield near Banja Luka, he praised defence sector reforms, saying just a year ago, organising such a drill would have been deemed absurd.
Yet McElhaney noted that BiH must fulfil all requirements for war crimes co-operation before being offered an invitation to join NATO.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UK Deputy Permanent Representative and Ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce said on Wednesday (August 13th) that the EU and the UN are working on a formula for EULEX's deployment in Kosovo, where it will assume many of UNMIK's duties.
UNMIK announced staff cuts of 70% earlier this week.
In Pristina, UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko says some of those cuts will extend to staff in northern Kosovo.
Earlier statements suggested that the reconfiguration would not affect the mainly Serb-inhabited area.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Wednesday (November 22nd) approved a request by Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu to seek the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur.
Tariceaunu says Flutur can no longer serve as a representative of the ruling National Liberal Party (PNL), now that he has announced plans to affiliate himself with the Liberal Platform, a bloc founded by former PNL chairman Theodor Stolojan.
The latter was expelled from the party a few weeks ago, after a dispute with the current leadership.
Local analysts say sacking Flutur could threaten the PNL's parliamentary majority.
Nearly 30 PNL members of the Senate announced on Wednesday that they have withdrawn support for Tariceanu.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested a Serb suspected of war crimes in Kosovo on Tuesday (March 10th) in Norway, they confirmed.
According to local newspaper Verdens Gang, the name of the 39-year-old Serb national appeared on a list of suspects prepared by UNMIK, which informed police in Norway about his presence in the country.
The suspect arrived there in 2007 using his real ID.
Verdens Gang says he faces charges of violence and persecution of Kosovo Albanians, without mentioning when he allegedly committed the crimes.
The report also suggested Kosovo had requested his extradition.
In other news, the Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC) warned on Tuesday that tens of thousands of civilians in Serbia still face the threat of unexploded cluster bombs dropped by NATO a decade ago.
The CMC is urging the Serbian government to ratify last year's Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions, which would ban this type of weapon.
In Belgrade meanwhile, the Serbian Progressive Party launched a campaign for early elections Tuesday.
Leader Tomislav Nikolic told the newspaper Press that he was certain elections would take place this year.
He added his party wanted to co-operate with all who seek to topple the "regime of President Boris Tadic", adding the only condition demanded of future allies would be opposition to Kosovo's independence.

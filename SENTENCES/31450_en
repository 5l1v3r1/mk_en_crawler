BUCHAREST, Romania -- Alba County launched a project called "Together for Community" on Tuesday (22 April), aiming to expand relations between Roma communities and public institutions. 
Pre-accession funds of the EU will support the initiative, under a special programme aimed at improving the living conditions of the Roma population.
In other news, Minister of Water and Environment Protection Petru Lificiu and a delegation from the European Commission signed a memorandum of understanding Tuesday on Romania's contribution to EU environmental programmes. 
The document earmarks budget transfers of 1.4m euros to co-finance environmental protection projects until the country enters the EU. 
That is expected to happen in 2007.

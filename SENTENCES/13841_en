ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The country's Kurdish community celebrated its new year Sunday (19 March) in several cities, amid tight security.
In Istanbul, tens of thousands of people rallied, lighting bonfires to signal springtime in the New Year ceremony known as Newroz.
The celebrations there were mainly peaceful.
However, stones were hurled sporadically at police as some members of the crowd waved separatist flags.
In the southeastern town of Sanliurfa, 27 demonstrators were detained for questioning after clashes with police.
In the Aegean port of Izmir, where some 5,000 people gathered, police reportedly stepped in when demonstrators displayed placards of jailed terrorist leader Abdullah Ocalan.

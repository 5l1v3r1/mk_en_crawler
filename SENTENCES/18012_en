BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (December 15th) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) must implement key reforms -- especially restructuring of the police sector -- before Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations with the EU can be formally concluded.
Rehn's statement was delivered by the European Commission (EC) Delegation in Sarajevo a day after the fifth, final round of technical talks on the SAA was held in the BiH capital.
Rehn praised the "professional and constructive" work of the BiH team during the technical negotiations, but said the EC would ratify the SAA only when the reform requirements are met.

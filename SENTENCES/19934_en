SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The first referendum in Bulgaria since the collapse of the communist regime failed on Sunday (February 17th) due to low voter turnout.
Participants were to respond "yes" or "no" to whether to approve the building of the Burgas- Alexandroupolis oil pipeline through the territory of the Burgas municipality.
Turnout was 27% in the Black Sea coastal municipality.
By law, a referendum is only valid if more than half of those entitled to vote cast ballots.
Among those who did vote, 3.25% supported the construction, compared to 96.77%, who opposed it.

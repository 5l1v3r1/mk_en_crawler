BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Government representatives of five Western Balkan states -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro -- adopted a new strategy for asylum, migration and visa policies during a conference organised by the European Commission in Brussels Wednesday (14 December).
The meeting was held under the framework of the EU Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme.
BiH Deputy Security Minister Dragan Mektic says the new strategy is aimed at harmonising relevant legal frameworks in the five countries to comply with EU standards, which in turn should lead to the liberalisation of the visa regime in the future.
In other news, the presidents of Bulgaria, Serbia and Macedonia began a two-day meeting in Ohrid on Thursday.
They are discussing issues related to regional co-operation, infrastructure projects in border regions and the Kosovo status talks.

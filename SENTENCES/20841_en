TIRANA, Albania -- The country must curb illegal migration, introduce new personal identification documents, strengthen public order and boost foreign relations before it will be entitled to eased visa regulations, European Commission delegation in Tirana head Helmut Lohan said on Thursday (March 6th).
During a meeting with Albanian Minister of Integration Majlinda Bregu, Lohan declined to offer a precise deadline for a lifting of visa requirements.
He reiterated, however, that visa liberalisation fully depends on Albanian authorities and their ability to meet the EU's criteria.

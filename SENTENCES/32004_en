BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- On Sunday (20 October), the Serbian Supreme Court rejected a complaint filed by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica regarding the electoral commission's decision to annul the presidential election because of low turnout. 
Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia claims there were as many as 600,000 non-existent names on the voter lists and that actual turnout had exceeded the 50 per cent required by law. 
The Supreme Court judges ruled that Kostunica's camp should have disputed the voter lists before the election.

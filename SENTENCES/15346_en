BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu announced the establishment of a national centre to fight bird flu on Saturday (28 May).
The new agency will be run by experts from the finance, interior, environment, health and transportation ministries.
On Sunday, the reported number of cases among birds climbed to 89, most of them in the counties of Brasov and Prahova.
The government has also vowed to prosecute farmers who sell infected poultry or hide evidence of epidemic in their flocks.
Nearly 400 such cases are suspected.
The World Health Organisation representative in Romania, Victor Olsavszky, said on Saturday that that the way in which the epidemic has spread in Romania is unlike any other in the last few years.
The main opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, issued a blunt statement Friday, claiming Romanian authorities are completely overwhelmed.

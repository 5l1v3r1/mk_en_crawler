PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The country's special prosecutor for organised crime, Stojanka Radovic, filed charges Tuesday (15 August) against a ten-member gang accused of detonating three bombs last summer and then murdering top police officer Slavoljub Scekic.
Prosecutors say Scekic was killed last August due to his investigation of the three bombings -- supposedly a racketeering attempt -- on the Splendid hotel in Becici.
Eight of the suspects have been in custody for months, while two remain at large.

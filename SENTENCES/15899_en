BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The UN envoy for Kosovo status talks, Martti Ahtisaari, met on Monday (22 May) with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica in Belgrade. 
Kostunica voiced dissatisfaction with the lack of progress in the decentralisation talks and called on the international community to take steps to boost their efficency. 
The next round of the Vienna talks is scheduled for Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the US envoy for the Kosovo status process, Frank Wisner, was in Pristina for meetings with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and members of the Pristina negotiation team. 
He again suggested that the future status of Kosovo must be settled by the end of the year. 
However, he said, the Kosovo Albanian team must resolve all issues related to minority rights.

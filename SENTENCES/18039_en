SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Two men that were wounded along with a woman and her six-month baby in a mob shooting in Sofia last week are Serbs wanted by Interpol. 
Bulgarian National Police Commissioner Valentin Petrov said on Monday (July 16th) said the pair, Jovica Lukic and Zarko Momcilov, managed to live in Bulgaria with false documents issued by Sofia police. 
Both are linked to Serbia's notorious Zemun clan.

ANKARA, Turkey -- A Kurdish radical group, the Kurdistan Liberation Hawks, threatened on Wednesday (February 20th) to stage a new wave of terrorist attacks to avenge air strikes Turkey has waged against terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq.
"We are starting the days of the apocalypse," the organisation said in a statement on its website.
The Hawks had kept a low-profile for almost two years.
Before that, it had assumed responsibility for a number of explosions in resorts in western and southern Turkey, as well as for a number of terrorist attacks in Istanbul.

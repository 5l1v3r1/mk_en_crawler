BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic strongly denounced on Friday (18 August) recent remarks by Kosovo Albanian leaders suggesting the formation of a Kosovo Army.
President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Ceku have referenced such a move on separate occasions over the past couple of weeks.
Tadic says it would be unacceptable and very dangerous.
He called on the international community to prevent such a development, warning that it could destabilise the region.
On Sunday, Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic said he does not believe an army would be established.
More likely, he said, was the formation of a small unit such as an honour guard, with 100-200 members.

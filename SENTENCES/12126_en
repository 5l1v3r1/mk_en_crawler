BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU said in a press release Tuesday (14 December) that completion of the Stabilisation and Association process with Albania hinges on progress in reforms.
EU officials met with an Albanian parliament delegation in early December.
Both sides agreed that the capacity for reform implementation should be improved and there must be a clear political will to apply necessary measures.
In other news, WHO regional director Marc Danzon said Tuesday the organisation would continue supporting projects in Albania.
He said WHO had allocated 1m euros for healthcare projects in the country during 2004-2005.
Health Minister Leonard Solis has said that the unstable economic situation is one of the main obstacles to resolving healthcare problems.

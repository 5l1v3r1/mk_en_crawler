ATHENS, Greece -- About 100 protestors heckled Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos on Tuesday (May 25th) as he toured just-completed restorations at the Acropolis.
The protestors, with bullhorns and banners, demanded back pay from the government -- in some cases up to 16 months worth -- and that contracts that are about to expire be renewed.
The protest ended peacefully after Geroulanos acknowledged that many of the demands are legitimate and pledged to work for solutions.

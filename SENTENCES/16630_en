SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling lifted on Friday (7 July) the bans on officials sanctioned by his predecessors, allowing them to hold office in political parties again.
The decision applies to some 60 people, though not to those who were sanctioned for lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The campaign for the November 25th elections for European Parliament (EP) members officially begins on Friday (October 26th), with 551 candidates running for the 35 seats Romania is entitled to in the EP.
A news poll by the Sociological Research and Branding Company finds the majority of Romanians view the EP elections as more important than national parliamentary ones.
More than a third -- 37% -- say they back the Democratic Party of President Traian Basescu.
The main opposition Social Democratic Party came in second with 21.5%, followed by the ruling National Liberal Party with 12.6% of the votes.

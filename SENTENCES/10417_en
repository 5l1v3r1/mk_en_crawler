SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The BiH government decided on Friday (19 November) to take measures to prevent fugitive war crimes indictees from accessing and using their property in the country.
Prime Minister Adnan Terzic said the decision involved 21 UN war crimes tribunal indictees whose assets have been frozen by the EU.
The list includes Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, Croatian General Ante Gotovina, four Serbian generals and 14 Bosnian Serbs.

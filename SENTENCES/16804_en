TIRANA, Albania -- The government decided on Friday (5 May) to grant an operating licence to a private Greek school in the Albanian town of Himara, populated mainly by ethnic Greeks. 
The institution, financed by Greece, opened in February but had not been officially licensed. 
It is expected to offer curricula in both Albanian and Greek for some 120 pupils.

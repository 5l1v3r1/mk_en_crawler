ANKARA, Turkey -- On Wednesday (7 May), officials played down criticism from US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz concerning Ankara's refusal to let the United States use its territory for the operation against Saddam Hussein's regime.
"From the very beginning, Turkey has never made a mistake on this issue and has taken the necessary steps with its utmost sincerity," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell acknowledged that, while the US administration was disappointed with Turkey's decision, partnership between the two countries has improved since last month.

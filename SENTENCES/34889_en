KURSUMLIJA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Stanko Pevac, spokesman for Serbia's Refugee Commissariat, said Friday (19 December) the country might close 100 refugee camps next year due to lack of financial resources. 
He called on international organisations to secure more financing and complained of decreasing foreign support to refugees living in the country. 
"Almost 90 per cent of our budget has gone while most of the international humanitarian organisations have pulled out from the country," Pevac stressed. 
This year, financial problems forced Serbia to close 130 centres housing 8,000 refugees.

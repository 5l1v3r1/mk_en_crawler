ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey may cut its ties with Israel if it does not receive an apology for a raid on a Turkish-led aid flotilla to Gaza that left nine people dead on May 31st, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Monday (July 5th). 
Israel "will either apologise or acknowledge an international, impartial inquiry and its conclusion. 
Otherwise, our diplomatic ties will be cut off," Davutoglu said in an interview with Hurriyet.
Unlike in previous statements, Davutoglu did not reject the establishment of an Israeli commission to look into the case. 
"If this commission concludes that the attack was unjust and apologises, then this would be sufficient," Davutoglu said. 
He said Ankara also insists on receiving compensation for damages suffered from the raid.

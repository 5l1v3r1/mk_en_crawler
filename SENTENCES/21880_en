SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Georgia views Bulgaria's proposal to host future peace talks with Russia on the situation in South Ossetia as a positive one, Deputy Foreign Minister Milen Keremedchiev told Bulgarian National Radio on Sunday (August 17th) upon his return from Tbilisi. 
However, the idea is in its early stages, and there is no agreement from Moscow yet. 
The other initiative by Bulgarian authorities is to make Bourgas a co-ordinating port for sending aid to Georgia. 
Authorities have approved more than 40 tonnes of aid for Georgia, an amount second only to that announced by the United States. 
Bulgaria has not taken a clear stance on the conflict so far, apart from calling for an end to violence.

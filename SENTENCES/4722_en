Former Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and former Army Chief of General Staff Metodi Stamboliski were each sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Tuesday (December 9th) after being found guilty of abuse of power and corruption. 
The case stemmed from a 2.4m-euro purchase of spare parts for army tanks.
Also charged were defence ministry logistics head Nelko Menkinovski, defence ministry adviser Aco Gjurceski and Mitre Petkovski, director of the metal company MZT-FOP. 
They received three-year sentences.
According to the indictment, the defendants inflicted damage to the state budget by buying four times the amount of parts needed to equip army tanks.
Buckovski, who headed the defence ministry at the time, has denied any wrongdoing and said the purchases were justified.
He and Stamboliski were convicted of approving an unplanned supply of spare parts for T-55 army tanks in late 2001, only a few months after a formal ceasefire had been negotiated between ethnic Albanian rebels and Macedonian security forces under the Ohrid Agreement. 
The Army General Staff proposed overhauling the tanks after intelligence was received about plans for the renewal of the conflict in a so-called National Liberation Army spring offensive.
The order was supplied by MZT-FOP, a company based in Skopje.
"Mitre Petkovski cannot be put on trial for managing to sell spare parts to the defence ministry. 
This is about an anachronistic ruling," said Stevan Pavleski, an attorney for the MZT-FOP head.
"The verdict is scandalous. 
In the past 13 months, I and the other defendants have provided complete evidence of our innocence," Buckovski said.
Political interference had skewed the verdict, he added. 
"What has happened between Friday and today is probably only known to Judge Vangelija Markulova," he said.

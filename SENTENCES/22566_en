SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The European Commission (EC) has assured Macedonia that its citizens will be able to travel to EU member states and inside the Schengen zone without visas next year, Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski said at a cabinet meeting Sunday (October 12th).
"Macedonia is close to the finish line in its visa liberalisation process," Bocevski said, adding it is ahead of all other countries in this process.
"We are currently the only country that has a national visa centre, biometric passports and national centre for integrated border management," Bocevski stressed.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The country's ombudsman, Ixhet Memeti, presented his annual report for 2006 on Wednesday (March 14th).
It noted persistent weaknesses and inefficiency in public administration and the judiciary, and stressed the need to strengthen mechanisms that protect human rights and freedoms.
Of the nearly 4,300 cases filed with the ombudsman's office last year, most involved citizen complaints regarding the judiciary's work, particularly prolonged court procedures and non-compliance with decisions by the European Court of Human Rights.

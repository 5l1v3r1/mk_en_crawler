ATHENS, Greece -- A council of judges dropped charges Tuesday (February 8th) against three former ministers accused in relation to land swap deals involving a local monastery. 
Former Agricultural Development and Foods Minister Evangelos Basiakos, former Rural Development Minister Alexandros Kontos and former Finance Minister Petros Doukas were indicted late last year on several charges, including breach of duty, fraud, and violating the public interest. 
All of them served in the previous government led by New Democracy. 
Investigators say the deals, benefitting the Vatopedi monastery in northern Greece, cost taxpayers over 100m euros.

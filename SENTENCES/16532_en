SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia's armed forces will gradually take over regional logistics operations for NATO forces beginning next year, working out of a new co-ordination centre that opened on Thursday (11 May) at the Petrovec military base. 
Defence Minister Jovan Manasievski and NATO Skopje Commander Brigadier General John Durance attended an opening ceremony at NATO Headquarters in Skopje. 
The move complies with a plan to reduce the staff there.

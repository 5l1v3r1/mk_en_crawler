SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The anti-corruption commission met for the first time Monday (18 November), and began work on a draft property statement that would be required of all future members of government. 
The panel is amending a draft endorsed by the previous administration, which requires officials to provide more information about personal property and sources of finance. 
It would be kept on file to track financial irregularities. 
Fighting corruption was a key campaign promise of the ruling coalition, For Macedonia Together.

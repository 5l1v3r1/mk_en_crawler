BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors announced on Wednesday (April 6th) they have filed a charge at the High Court against European Parliament (EP) member Corneliu Vadim Tudor, for disobeying a court ruling and disturbing public order. 
The investigation against Tudor, leader of the nationalist Greater Romania party, began in January after he allegedly insulted and threw a glass of water at an official who was trying to deliver an eviction order. 
He allegedly also threatened police officers. 
The party was being asked to vacate a building that is being returned to its pre-communist era owners. 
Tudor says he acted in self-defence.

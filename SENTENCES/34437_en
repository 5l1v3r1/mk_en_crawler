BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said Wednesday (15 October) that he has asked the National Control Authority and prosecutors to investigate corruption allegations against government Secretary General Serban Mihailescu.
A Swiss businessman of Romanian origin, Octavian Ionescu, says he bribed Mihailescu and another official, Virgil Teodorescu, to win a tourism investment project in the mountain resort of Busteni.
He says the two demanded more money for further help.
Mihailescu denied the accusations, calling them a "fabrication".
The new scandal follows ones involving EU Integration Minister Hildegard Puwak and Healthcare Minister Mircea Beuran.

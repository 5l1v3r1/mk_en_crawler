SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The allocation of 115m euros in public revenues collected by the BiH Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA) has been unblocked after the central and entity governments reached a provisional agreement on distributing funds, ITA head Kemal Causevic announced on Wednesday (26 April).
Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the National Fiscal Council, he said that BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and his counterparts from the Federation of BiH, Ahmet Hadzipasic, and Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, struck a deal on the allocation ratios, under which funds collected in April and May would be divided among the entities and Brcko District.
They also agreed to draft and endorse by 20 June a new allocation regimen, which is expected to be based on entities' performance in collecting VAT revenues.

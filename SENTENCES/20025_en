ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erodogan described as "nonsense" Tuesday (March 18th) suggestions that his government will call an early general election to thwart a court case that threatens his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Speaking at a press conference, Erdogan ruled out holding an early general election to coincide with municipal polls later this year.
However, he warned that the case, brought last week by the chief prosecutor of the Court of Appeals, is harming both the economy and democracy.
The prosecutor, claiming that the AKP is a hotbed of anti-secular activity, wants the party banned.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Friday (3 October) that Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic was still hiding in Serbia. 
She promised to share her information about his whereabouts with Serbia-Montenegro authorities. 
The government in Belgrade has claimed that it lost track of the former general more than one year ago when the army stopped supporting him. 
On the broader issue of Serbia-Montenegro's co-operation with the UN tribunal, del Ponte noted that there had been some improvement, but said that more needs to be done. 
She complained that Belgrade has not given prosecutors enough access to government and military archives.

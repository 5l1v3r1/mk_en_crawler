ANKARA, Turkey -- A court has released a man accused of planning to kill Jewish rabbis and Patriarch Bartholomew, the leader of the world's Orthodox leaders, local media reported on Wednesday (December 22nd).
After the first hearing Wednesday, Ismet Recber was released pending the outcome of the trial.
If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
He denies all charges.
Recber, a carpenter, was arrested after an anonymous letter claimed that a suspect in another trial had tapped him to do the killing, as part of an alleged larger plot to topple the Islam-rooted government.

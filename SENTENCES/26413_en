BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government announced on Thursday (February 11th) it has decided to delay by six months the introduction of mandatory cash register devices for taxi drivers and lawyers. 
The measure will take effect August 31st, instead of next month. 
Trade Minister Slobodan Milosavljevic said the government needs more time to "study the effects" of the change. 
It is the second time the measure has been delayed. 
Lawyers say cash registers could jeopardise client privacy. 
Taxi drivers say it will be an unwelcome hassle.

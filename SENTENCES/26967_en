PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The interior ministry presented a strategy Wednesday (November 4th) against illegal immigration. 
Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti said the government has approved the plan, as despite efforts to fight the phenomenon, there are still a lot of cases, including some that end in fatalities. 
Just last month, a group of Kosovo Albanians attempted to enter Hungary illegally from Serbia. 
Their boat capsized and sank in the Tisza River, killing an estimated 15 people, including young children.

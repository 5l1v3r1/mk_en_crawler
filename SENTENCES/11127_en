ANKARA, Turkey -- Government spokesman and Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told journalists on Monday (27 December) that Turkey wants to revive UN-mediated talks on the reunification of Cyprus. 
He also expressed hope that the negotiations would be based on the UN plan for the island and would be completed by 3 October, when Turkey is due to start its accession talks with the EU. 
Greek Cypriots rejected the UN plan during a referendum in April.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The supply of Russian gas to Greece was restored early Thursday (August 9th), according to the Bulgarian gas company Bulgargaz.
An explosion Monday at the pipeline near Blagoevgrad had disrupted service.
The pipeline provides 80% of Greece's needs for natural gas.
Consumers were not affected, however, because they were supplied by a local liquefied gas storage facility.
An investigation into the cause of the blast continues.

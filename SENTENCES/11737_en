ZAGREB, Croatia -- Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged the EU on Monday (20 December) to encourage Croatia to demonstrate progress in its war crimes trials. 
The organisation noted that while the EU conditioned the start of accession talks on full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, no such condition was set regarding domestic war crimes trials. 
According to HRW, these have been marked by bias, lack of professionalism and inadequate police co-operation.

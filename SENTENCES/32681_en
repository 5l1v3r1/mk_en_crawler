SKOPJE, Macedonia -- NATO Ambassador to Macedonia Nicolaas Biegman has warned the opposition VMRO-DPMNE that its decision to boycott a meeting on the Ohrid peace accord would result in complete international isolation.
Last week, VMRO-DPMNE said its leader Ljubco Georgievski - one of the four signatories of the agreement - would not attend the 26 December session organised by President Boris Trajkovski.
The move is in protest of what Georgievski claims is a political purge initiated by the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia.
In an interview with Radio Free Europe, Biegman implied that political squabbling should not be linked to implementation of the peace agreement.
No one in the West - including NATO and the EU - would understand such a protest, he said.
In other news, Macedonia is rotating its peacekeepers serving with the Turkish contingent in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.
It plans to deploy more there in the new year.

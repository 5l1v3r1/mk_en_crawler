SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska's (RS) ruling SNSD said that its priority in upcoming talks on constitutional reform in BiH would be the establishment of a federal structure.
After a meeting of the SNSD main board on Thursday (May 10th), the party said a federal structure could provide an easier solution to long-elusive police reform and for a police structure that meets both EU standards and domestic constitutional principles.
SNSD also denied reports that Sulejman Tihic, the leader of the main Bosniak party SDA, has sent a letter to RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, proposing a political agreement aimed at resolving the constitutional and police reform issues, as well as Srebrenica's status.
On Wednesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn sent a warning letter to BiH authorities, in which he seriously criticized the ongoing delay in reforms.
He expressed regret over the deteriorating political climate and the return of nationalistic rhetoric, adding that this had brought increased risks to security and stability.
If BiH wants to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, it should make major changes, the commissioner said.

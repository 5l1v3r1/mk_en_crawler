BELGRADE, Serbia -- Zeljko Mitrovic, owner of the Balkans' biggest TV station, Pink, said on Thursday (January 27th) that he has been deliberately poisoned. 
Mitrovic, 44, a former ally of the late Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic, has been in a German hospital for four weeks, and before that, in a Belgrade hospital. 
Pink TV reported on Thursday that arsenic, lead and benzene had been found in the mogul's blood and he is suffering from aplastic anemia, a potentially fatal blood disease.
"I suspect everyone except my wife and children," Mitrovic told B92 radio, adding that "someone had poured" poisonous substances into his food and drink.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia's Democratic Party (DS), the backbone of the now defunct ruling coalition Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), has sealed a partnership with two other parties, weeks before the 28 December general elections. 
DS will run a joint ticket with federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic's Civic Alliance Party and Dragoljub Micunovic's Democratic Centre. 
Also, DS agreed to have Federal Defence Minister Boris Tadic lead the DS ticket, while Zoran Zivkovic will run as its candidate for prime minister.
In other news, the commission working to draft a new Serbian Constitution reportedly has dropped its efforts. 
Radio B92 says several members have left the panel, leaving it up to the new parliament elected next month to complete the draft.

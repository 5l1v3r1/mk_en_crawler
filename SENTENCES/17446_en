BELGRADE, Serbia -- KFOR Commander Lieutenant General Roland Kather says his personnel have worked hard to stabilise the security situation in Kosovo and would not allow any form of violence there.
In an interview in the latest edition of the Serbian magazine Euro-Atlantic Review, Kather described the current situation in Kosovo as calm and noted that there has been a decline of ethnically motivated violence.
In the same magazine, the head of the KFOR's Multinational Task Force East and commander of the US troops in Kosovo, Brigadier General Douglas B. Earhart, suggested that ethnic extremists represent the biggest challenge to security.

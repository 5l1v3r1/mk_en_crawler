BAGHDAD, Iraq -- During a visit to the city of Sulaimaniya on Friday (September 7th), Iraqi President Jalal Talabani officially called on Kurdish militants to stop using northern Iraq to launch attacks against Turkey and Iran.
Talabani said he was not threatening the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas, but was making an appeal to them.
He urged the PKK to stop using Iraq as a base for at least a year or two, in order to avoid the possibility of a foreign invasion.
Several thousand PKK fighters are believed to be based in mountains inside Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region near the Turkish border.
In related news, the Turkish Army said it has decided to maintain three high-security zones in the country's southeast -- in the provinces of Siirt, Sirnak and Hakkari -- for three more months.
The zones were established on June 10th and will now be valid until December 10th.

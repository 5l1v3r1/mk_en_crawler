THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Vojislav Seselj, asked The Hague war crimes tribunal Tuesday (August 18th) to resume the trial against him.
The proceedings were suspended in February after a witness claimed he received threats from Seselj.
At a status conference Tuesday, Seselj said three foreign intelligence services are trying to destroy the SRS and are working to ensure he remains at The Hague for as long as possible.
He is charged with war crimes against non-Serbs committed in Croatia, Vojvodina and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1991 and 1993.
In other news, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic says his conscience is clear, despite genocide charges he faces stemming from the Bosnian conflict.
"I do not regret my own role," Karadzic wrote in a letter to Reuters on Tuesday, from a detention centre in The Hague.

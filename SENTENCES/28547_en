BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu said on Saturday (July 10th) that the VAT rate should be reduced to its previous level and pensions should be taxed instead. 
In response, Prime Minister Emil Boc said the VAT rate would only be reduced if the government finds alternative revenue-makers. 
The government recently hiked the rate from 19% to 24%. 
Boc said that taxing pensions could not produce that kind of revenue.

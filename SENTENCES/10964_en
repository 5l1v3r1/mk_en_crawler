SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Authorities reacted Monday (30 May) to a recent move by the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC), concerning the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC), whose independence is not recognised by Belgrade's religious leaders. 
Late last week, the SOC decided to officially declare as autocephalous the so-called Ohrid Orthodox Archbishopric, led by a controversial Macedonian bishop, Jovan, who was accused of separatism and defrocked by the MOC last year. 
In separate statements Monday, Macedonia's President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski called on Belgrade authorities to resolve the problem and prevent it from harming bilateral ties.
Also Monday, Crvenkovski voiced concern about the pace of implementing internationally set standards in Kosovo. 
In an interview with the Belgrade-based English language magazine CorD, Crvenkovski suggested that the current pace makes efforts to resolve the province's status considerably harder.

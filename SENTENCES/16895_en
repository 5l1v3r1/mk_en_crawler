TIRANA, Albania -- Political tensions are high again following a heated exchange Tuesday (4 April) between Prime Minister Sali Berisha of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and senior DP lawmaker Spartak Ngjela.
According to local media reports, Berisha blamed Ngjela, chairman of parliament's law commission, for the continued failure to adopt crucial draft laws submitted by the government.
Berisha reportedly asked Ngjela to resign from his post on the commission.
Ngjela refused, saying Berisha repeatedly neglected his warnings that the measures violated the constitution.
This latest fray follows protracted squabbles between the DP and the opposition Socialist Party that have hampered parliament's work for months.

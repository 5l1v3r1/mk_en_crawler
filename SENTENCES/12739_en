ANKARA, Turkey -- European Parliament President Josep Borrell Fontelles visited Ankara on Friday (3 December) and said Turkey's recognition of Cyprus is part of the EU accession process.
Speaking to reporters after a conference on EU-Turkish relations, Fontelles said that recognising the Greek Cypriot administration is not a new condition for Turkey.
He reminded that Cyprus is one of the 25 EU member states, with which Turkey must negotiate its entry in the Union.
"It is not possible to negotiate with someone you do not recognise," stressed Fontelles.

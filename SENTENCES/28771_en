BELGRADE, Serbia -- War crimes prosecutors announced on Saturday (September 11th) they have issued orders not to flood an artificial lake, instead giving investigators more time to search for the remains of war crimes victims. 
The remains of up to 250 people believed to be Bosnian Muslim victims of the 1992-95 conflict have been recovered so far from the Perucac Lake, on the border between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
The lake was partially drained in June to rebuild the Bajina Basta hydro power plant. 
It was due to be flooded again soon. 
The international community requested a delay, as did the Institute for Missing Persons in BiH.

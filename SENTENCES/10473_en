BERLIN, Germany -- Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on Monday (18 October) assured Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul that Germany fully backed Turkey's EU membership bid and would exert every effort to persuade fellow EU members to support the launch of accession talks with Ankara.
Meeting with Gul in Berlin, Fischer cautioned that it might be more than a decade before Turkey was ready for entry into the Union.
Gul, in turn, again called for openness and objectiveness regarding Turkey's bid.

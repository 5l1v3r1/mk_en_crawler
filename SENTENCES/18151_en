BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) officially joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) Programme Thursday (December 14th), on the 11th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the war in BiH.
Serbian President Boris Tadic, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic, and BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic signed the framework document at a ceremony at NATO headquarters.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer reminded them that while the countries were invited to join with no conditions applied, Serbia and BiH would be expected to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal and their efforts would be monitored closely.
In other news Thursday, the Serbian Foreign Ministry announced that NATO would open an office in Belgrade to assist in the movement of Alliance troops across Serbia.
The move is part of an agreement signed in July of last year.

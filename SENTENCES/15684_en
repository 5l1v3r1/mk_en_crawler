PODGORICA, Montenegro -- The Montenegrin Army's chief of general staff, General Jovan Lakcevic, met on Thursday (November 23rd) with his Croatian counterpart, Josip Lucic. 
They discussed collaboration between the armies and agreed to sign a military co-operation accord soon. 
It would include patrolling the Adriatic Sea, co-ordinating responses to emergencies in the Adriatic, joint training of officers, and other changes required for eventual NATO membership. 
Montenegro is hoping to be accepted into NATO's Partnership for Peace Programme at the Alliance's summit in Riga next week.

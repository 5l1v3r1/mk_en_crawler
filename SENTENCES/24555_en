SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik repudiated criticism by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak as "incorrect and general" Monday (December 8th).
Lajcak told the UN Security Council last Friday that the political situation in RS remains difficult and reforms have virtually stalled since the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in June.
Dodik said Lajcak sought through his criticism to extend the mandate of the Office of the High Representative.
In other news Monday, an unknown arsonist or arsonists set fire to a mosque in the RS village of Fazlagica Kula.
The fire coincided with the Muslim celebration of Kurban Bayram.
Nobody suffered injury, though property damage was significant.
Dodik said his government will punish those responsible.

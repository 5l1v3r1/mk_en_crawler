SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The cabinet's massive replacement of public administration officials has delayed the adoption of a key police bill, according to EU officials attending the Macedonia-European Commission (EC) Stabilisation and Association Committee meeting, under way in Skopje.
The head of the EC expert team, Pierre Mirel, urged parliament Tuesday (19 September) to be responsible and consistent in adopting EU-related legislation.
He added the EC is satisfied generally with the course of economic reforms as well as with progress in the judiciary sector, the fight against corruption and the implementation of the Ohrid agreement.

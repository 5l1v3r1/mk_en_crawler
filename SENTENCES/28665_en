NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The UN plans no international conference on Cyprus, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special adviser on Cyprus, Alexander Downer, said on Tuesday (October 12th) after meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias. 
He said that he and Christofias reviewed progress in the ongoing talks to reunify the divided island, and he urged both sides to reach an agreement on the complex property issue. 
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu are to resume talks Wednesday. 
Their last meeting was more than a month ago, due to Christofias' participation in the 65th session of UN General Assembly in New York.

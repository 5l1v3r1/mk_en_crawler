BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament adopted a document Wednesday (10 May) regarding the future structure of BiH police forces that, in part, includes a recommendation for changes in the BiH police reform directorate. 
The document suggests that the panel must be transformed because its current composition does not comply with a political agreement reached last year. 
Parliament's move came several weeks after RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik first questioned the legitimacy of the directorate.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Tests conducted by a laboratory in Istanbul have ruled out alleged attempts to poison jailed Kurdistan Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
According to an official announcement Monday (12 March), the Istanbul Criminal Medical Laboratory conducted tests of hair, blood and urine samples taken from Ocalan, and found no evidence to support the claims. 
His lawyers had claimed that earlier hair samples contained traces of toxic metals. 
Ocalan is currently the sole inmate at a prison in Imrali.

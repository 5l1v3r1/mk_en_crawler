TIRANA, Albania -- Opposition parties say they plan to stage new protests next month in response to what they have described as negligence by the government in addressing issues stemming from the June 2009 general elections. 
Representatives of the Socialist Party (SP) and smaller parties met on Thursday (September 23rd) to unify their positions. 
The head of the Social Democracy Party, Paskal Milo, said the opposition is looking for transparency in the electoral process, adding the government continues to ignore all initiatives to find a solution. 
The SP has claimed for well over a year now that the elections were manipulated.

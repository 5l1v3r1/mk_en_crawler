SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb police said Tuesday (5 July) that explosive devices were found planted at Srebrenica's memorial centre ahead of the 10th anniversary of the wartime massacre. 
Some 50,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony on 11 July. 
Radovan Pejic, spokesman for the Bosnian Serb police, said police learned of the explosives from EUFOR and that mine-clearing experts were sent to the site. 
During the commemoration, another 610 identified victims from Srebrenica will be buried in Potocari, joining 1,327 victims already there.
In other news, Senior Deputy High Representative Martin Ney warned on Monday that mid-September is the deadline for resolving the deadlock over crucial BiH police reform, if the country wants to begin Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with the EU this autumn. 
Ney held a news conference in Banja Luka, where he was meeting with top Republika Srpska officials.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Parliament voted Monday (22 December) to elect Vladimir Seks, 66, of the Croatian Democratic Union as its new speaker. 
Seks, a party founder, served as deputy prime minister from 1992-1994, under Franjo Tudjman.
Also Monday, newly elected members of parliament took their oath of office and adopted changes that allow Prime Designate Ivo Sanader to reduce the number of cabinet ministers from 19 to 14. 
The session continues Tuesday with an expected confidence vote on Sanader's new government.
The foreign ministry, meanwhile, announced that Finland has ratified Croatia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. 
That leaves only three Union members -- Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands -- that must still ratify it.

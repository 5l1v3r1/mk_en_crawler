SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney has again voiced his expectation that the country's eight main parties would agree on key constitutional reforms by Wednesday (1 March). 
In an interview published in Tuesday's Dnevni avaz, McElhaney said he believes that the various parties would keep a pledge made in October to strike a deal by March. 
He estimated that only about 5 per cent of the issues related to the constitutional reforms remain unresolved. 
A signing ceremony originally set for Sunday had to be postponed due to concerns raised by the Croat bloc.
In other news, BiH veterinary authorities confirmed on Monday the first cases of bird flu in the country, saying that British lab tests on two dead swans, found last week, detected the deadly H5N1 virus strain. 
Measures are being taken in the two affected areas.

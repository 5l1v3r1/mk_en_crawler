ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government adopted a draft law Thursday (November 12th) on the arbitration border agreement with Slovenia and forwarded it to parliament for approval.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said she expects debate and ratification next week.
It requires a two-thirds majority vote.
The border issue has stalled Croatia's EU accession talks for months.

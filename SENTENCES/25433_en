BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Superior Council of Magistracy (CSM) turned down on Thursday (September 24th) Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu's proposal to reappoint Laura Codruta Kovesi for a second 3-year term as a prosecutor general. 
CSM's decision is only consultative; the final decision rests with President Traian Basescu. 
He has implied he will not renew Kovesi's mandate, saying she failed to properly handle an inquiry into the 1989 events that toppled the communist regime.

TIRANA, Albania -- Police chief Ahmet Prenci met with Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble on Tuesday (July 14th) to discuss ways to enhance co-operation against organised crime. 
Prenci said that last year, Albanian authorities quintupled the number of requests for extradition of wanted criminals. 
He says that the success of Albania's police is tied to implementing advanced technology at border crossings, as well as better co-ordination among state institutions in fighting illegal activities. 
Noble, in turn, backed a proposal to grant Tirana the right to host an international Interpol conference.

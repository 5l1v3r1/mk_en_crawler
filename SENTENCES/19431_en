NEW YORK, United States -- Srgjan Kerim, the new president of the UN General Assembly, added heat to the longstanding name dispute with Greece on Tuesday (September 25th) by calling his home-country Macedonia.
Speaking about Branko Crvenkovski, Kerim referred to him as 'president of the Republic of Macedonia' -- a phrase that sparked an immediate protest from Greek representative John Morikis.
He requested that in all matters within the UN, Macedonia be referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Despite the protest, Kerim ended his speech by insisting his country will remain the Republic of Macedonia.
Separately Tuesday, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns met with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis in New York and called for progress regarding the name dispute.
"Athens and Skopje should speed up negotiations on the issue," Burns said.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives (CNSAS) is looking into whether President Traian Basescu had a file and possibly collaborated with the Communist-era security police. 
The inquiry was launched at the request of former President Emil Constantinescu. 
He claims Basescu had contributed to Securitate but that his file was destroyed.
Separately Tuesday, Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu accused Basescu of links to Securitate, but offered no concrete evidence. 
Voiculescu, whose party is a junior partner in the ruling coalition, recently was identified as a former Securitate collaborator by CNSAS.
Meanwhile, Mircea Ionescu Quintus, the honorary chairman of the Romanian ruling Liberal Party, resigned following accusations that he had served as an informant. 
Quintus, a former justice minister, spent years in prison during the Ceausescu regime.

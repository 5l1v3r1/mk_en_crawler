ANKARA, Turkey -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the commanders of the Turkish Army, and opposition members of parliament refused to attend a reception marking a national holiday on Wednesday (23 April), to protest the wearing of Islamic head scarves at public events. 
Secularists in Turkey insist on continuing with the ban on the use of the headscarf at public functions and in government offices because they see it as a violation of the separation between church and state. 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc, whose wife was at the centre of the controversy, tried to defuse tensions by appearing alone at the event. 
However, the wives of at least five lawmakers also turned up, wearing scarves. 
The ruling Justice and Development Party says wearing the headscarf is an expression of religious freedom.

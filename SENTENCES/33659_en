PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo Assembly Speaker Nexhat Daci said Monday (8 September) that the success of future talks between Pristina and Belgrade would be jeopardised if the United States does not take part in the negotiations.
He added that Kosovo authorities are ready to start talks at any time.
Daci met with the former head of the OSCE observer mission in Kosovo, US diplomat William Walker, who assured him that the OSCE would take an active part in organising talks.

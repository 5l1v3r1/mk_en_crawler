PRISTINA, Kosovo -- With 99% of the votes counted, preliminary results released by the Central Election Commission on Monday (December 13th) suggest Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) won 33.5% of the votes cast during Sunday's snap elections. 
The Democratic League of Kosovo got 23.6%, while the newcomer, Vetevendosje, won 12.2%. 
The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo was fourth with 10.8% of the votes. 
If these results are confirmed, the next government will have to be a broad coalition of three or more parties.
The EU is urging the new government be formed as soon as possible to start long-awaited dialogue with Belgrade. 
In a press release Monday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele congratulated the public for participating in a "calm and orderly manner" and praised those responsible for organising the vote with short notice. 
"Now it is up to the competent authorities to certify the results and to deal with complaints and appeals in line with the relevant laws and regulations," the EU officials said.

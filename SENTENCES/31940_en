BERLIN, Germany -- Defence Minister Peter Struck said Tuesday (26 November) that the first mission of the new European rapid reaction force might be to replace SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
The 60,000-strong force is to become operational in 2003. 
He was sceptical, however, about the possibility of the EU taking over the NATO mission in Macedonia anytime soon, given an ongoing dispute between Turkey and Greece concerning this issue.

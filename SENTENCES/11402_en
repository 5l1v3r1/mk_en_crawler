SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Office of High Representative Paddy Ashdown issued a statement Tuesday (24 May) saying that in the three years since Ashdown took office, the country has moved decisively from the Dayton era towards EU membership. 
The statement said considerable progress has been achieved in strengthening the BiH state, reducing nationalism and launching a firm Euro-Atlantic integration course.

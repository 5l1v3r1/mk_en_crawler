BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso assured Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Thursday (21 September) that the upcoming EC monitoring report would objectively assess the progress made by the country.
Meeting in Brussels, they discussed recent efforts Bucharest has made in implementing the to-do list drawn up after the last monitoring report, issued in May.
Major news agencies are reporting that the EC will likely recommend accession for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, but with the heaviest restrictions and safeguards ever applied to new members.
The EU has been disappointed with Bulgaria's progress in fighting corruption and organised crime, while Romania has been criticised over technical issues.

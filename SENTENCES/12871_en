SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The UN war crimes tribunal will continue operating until Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic have been brought to justice, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said during a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday (1 February), adding that it is a shame the two top suspects and a number of others are still at large ten years after the end of the Bosnian conflict. 
Following her talks with High Representative Paddy Ashdown, del Ponte headed to Montenegro for a two-day visit.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Election Commission has accepted the candidacy of Dragoljub Micunovic for president, according to a report by Belgrade-based B92 on Tuesday (21 October). 
As expected, he would be the main candidate of Serbia's ruling coalition, Democratic Opposition of Serbia. 
Micunovic, who seemed to be reconsidering his nomination amid internal party squabbling, is the fifth registered candidate running in the 16 November election.

AMMAN, Jordan -- A foreign ministry spokesman says Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria have agreed to a Turkish initiative to hold a regional meeting on the situation in Iraq.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saudi al-Faisal confirmed the news in interviews with the kingdom's newspapers Monday (20 January).
Iran, the fifth country invited, has also signalled support for the conference.
According to international media reports, the meeting could result in dispatching a delegation to Baghdad to try to persuade Iraq to co-operate more closely with the UN weapons inspectors.
There is also speculation the countries might propose an arrangement under which Saddam Hussein would go into exile.

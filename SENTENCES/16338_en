VIENNA, Austria -- The Austrian presidency of the EU plans to open negotiations with Turkey on two chapters of the acquis -- Education and Culture, and Science and Research -- by June, according to Austrian Prime Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on Friday (12 May). 
He made this statement during a meeting with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the EU-Latin America-Caribbean summit in Vienna. 
Schuessel said Austria would like to see talks on these two chapters launched before its mandate at the helm of the EU expires next month.

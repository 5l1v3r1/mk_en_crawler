SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The armies of BiH's two entities have been downsized from a total of 19,200 men to 12,000, Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic said Friday (4 June).
The Federation of BiH force will number 8,000, compared to 4,000 for the Republika Srpska Army.
The move is part of a reform plan that creates a single command structure.
The two armies will have a common general staff, the same uniforms and flag, but will remain ethnically distinct.
In other news, the Bosnian Serb government said Friday that its special commission on Srebrenica has now located 31 previously unknown mass graves.
Still unclear is how many bodies may be contained in the graves.
At least 7,000 Muslims went missing when Srebrenica was run over by Serb forces in 1995.

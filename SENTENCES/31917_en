PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- Uke Bytyci, mayor of Suva Reka and a senior official in President Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), was gunned down with his two bodyguards Sunday (27 October). 
A suspect was being held for questioning. 
Kosovo's chief UN officer Michael Steiner called the incident "an appalling act of calculated murder." Observers worry about a resurgence of violence inside the ethnic Albanian political community. 
LDK officials were targets of attacks two years ago.
Preliminary results from Saturday's local elections meanwhile suggest the LDK won in 14 of the 30 municipalities; PDK appears to have won in four. 
Ethnic Serbs won in the four municipalities with heavily Serb populations.

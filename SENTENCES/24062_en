BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Dragan Cavic, former Republika Srpska (RS) president and ex-leader of the main opposition Serbian Democratic Party, registered his new Democratic Party at the Banja Luka court Friday (January 16th).
Fellow co-founders are Momchilo Novakovic, Vojislav Gligic and Branislav Skobo.
Cavic said his party collected 900 signatures, nearly double the 500 signatures required by law.
He also said that in the two years until the next general elections, the party will remain in opposition and will not join any coalitions.
He says his party will provide an alternative to voters who fail to identify with parties currently in parliament.

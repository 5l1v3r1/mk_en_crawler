ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party has decided not to push a legislative provision that would have made adultery a criminal offence.
The disputed text, which caused an uproar in Turkey and threatened to jeopardise relations with the EU, was missing from the proposed amendments to the Penal Code presented to parliament on Tuesday (14 September).
The move came after a surprise meeting between Justice Minister Cemil Cicek, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and Deniz Baykal, the head of the opposition Republican People's Party.
The three leaders told reporters that only provisions approved by both parties in parliament would be put to debate.
That excluded the adultery article, which the Republicans had opposed all along.

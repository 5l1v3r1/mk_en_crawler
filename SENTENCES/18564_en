SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Top war crimes fugitives Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are not hiding on BiH territory, the commander of NATO HQ Sarajevo, Major General Richard Wightman, said in an interview published by Dnevni avaz on Saturday (March 10th). 
He said the latest available information, dating back two years, suggests that both are in Belgrade.
Wightman also commented on the threat of terrorism and other security challenges facing BiH, saying that both terrorism and the network of aides and supporters of indicted war criminals were linked to organised crime. 
The NATO HQ chief assessed positively the pace of defence reforms in BiH. 
He praised the recent entry of the country in the Partnership for Peace programme, voicing his belief that BiH would eventually join the Alliance.

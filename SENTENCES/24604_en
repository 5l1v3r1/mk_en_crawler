SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) â Authorities have discovered a new mass grave containing the remains of 16 Croat and Muslim Bosnian civilians killed in the 1992-1995 conflict, Marko Jurisic of the BiH National Institute for Missing Persons announced on Sunday (December 7th).
Jurisic said Bosnian Serb soldier Slobodan Miljkovic took the 16 victims from a Serb prison camp and killed them to avenge the death of a friend.
The Hague tribunal charged him with war crimes, but he died ten years ago.

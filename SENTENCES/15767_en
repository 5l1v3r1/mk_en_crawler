STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament's (EP) external relations commission voted on Thursday (November 23rd) in favour of possibly delaying the decommissioning deadline for two reactors at Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear power plant.
Bulgarian National Radio reports that the end-of-December deadline might be extended by eight months, given concerns over energy supply stability in the Balkans, where Bulgaria is a major energy exporter.
In other news, Russia announced on Wednesday that it might impose a ban on meat imports from the EU, amid concerns over the quality of meat products from incoming members Bulgaria and Romania.
A government spokesman in Moscow said everything would depend on steps taken by the EU regarding these products.

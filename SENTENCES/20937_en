BELGRADE, Serbia -- The EU and the United States congratulated incumbent Boris Tadic on his victory in the presidential run-off, predicting it would bring Serbia closer to eventual EU candidate status.
In a statement Monday (February 4th), European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Sunday's results represented "a victory for democracy in Serbia and for the European values we share".
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told Reuters that Tadic's re-election would open the way for signing an interim co-operation agreement on trade, political dialogue, visa liberalisation and education this week.
Separately, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack praised Tadic's win over ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic.
"We look forward to continuing our efforts to build a productive relationship with Serbia on matters of common interest," he said.

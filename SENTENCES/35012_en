BERLIN, Germany -- In an article published Saturday (6 December), Defence Minister Peter Struck suggested that EU countries should reduce their military presence in the Balkans. 
"The progress in Bosnia lends to a reduction in the amount of troops, currently at 12,000, to 7,000 next year," he wrote. 
Struck also urged the Balkan governments to assume greater responsibility for the peace process in the region.

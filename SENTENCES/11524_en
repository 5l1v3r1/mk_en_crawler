BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's President Traian Basescu on Friday (20 May) criticised the work of the centre-right coalition government led by Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, and again suggested that early elections should be held in the country. 
Basescu voiced dissatisfaction with the way the cabinet tackled the consequences of the recent floods, as well as delays in the legislative field related to judicial reform and the fight against corruption.
In unrelated news, doctors said Saturday that former President Ion Iliescu will remain at the hospital because of new health problems. 
Iliescu was hospitalised a week ago due to high blood pressure.

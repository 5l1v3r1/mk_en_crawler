LAHORE, Pakistan -- Relatives of six Pakistanis killed by Macedonian police in March 2002 will file a suit in the International Court of Justice, a lawyer said Sunday (2 May).
He explained that compensation in the amount of $2m per victim would be sought.
Last week, the Macedonian government admitted that the killings of the six Pakistanis and an Indian had been staged by former Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski to impress the West.
Security officials described the seven as Islamic terrorists.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Republika Srpska (RS) Parliament failed Tuesday (30 March) to adopt constitutional draft amendments that would have led to changing the entity's main city.
The RS capital would have been relocated from Srpsko Sarajevo to Banja Luka, where most entity institutions are now based.
The changes failed to garner the required two-thirds majority.
Milorad Dodik, leader of the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), expressed regret that the issue had been politicised and said the SNSD plans to try again.

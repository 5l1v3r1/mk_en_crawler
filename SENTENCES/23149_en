BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik appointed former BiH Economy Minister Slobodan Puhalac as RS's new minister of economy, energy and development on Tuesday (July 1st).
He succeeds Rajko Ubiparip, who left the post in April for health reasons.
Puhalac resigned from the BiH government in mid-June citing personal reasons.
At the time, the local press described him as one of the most inefficient cabinet members, with no major achievements to cite.
Yet at a news conference Tuesday, Dodik said Puhalac has the experience and enthusiasm to accelerate RS's economic growth, boost development of the energy sector and help draft a comprehensive new economic strategy.

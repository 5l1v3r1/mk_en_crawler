TIRANA, Albania -- European Parliament (EP) Rapporteur for Albania Tanja Fajon says the EP will make a final decision on Albania's and Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) EU visa liberalisation process in October, four months after the European Commission delivers the legislative proposal.
Fajon discussed the timeframe during consultations in Brussels Tuesday (April 27th), regarding the progress of the two countries.
She added that the pace of the process will be determined by authorities in aspiring countries, especially in terms of legislative reforms and security.

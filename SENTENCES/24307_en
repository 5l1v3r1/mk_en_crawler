ANKARA, Turkey -- One soldier died and two others suffered injuries Tuesday (May 12th) in a land mine explosion in Cukurca in the southeastern province of Hakkari, security sources said. 
The soldiers were on patrol in a rural area when the blast occurred. 
Sources blamed the explosives on the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
On Monday, five mortar shells fell on Turkish territory in Hakkari after troops -- thought to be Iranian -- opened fire on positions of the PKK's Iranian wing, PEJAK, in northern Iraq. 
Local officials say the shells fell near the village of Saridere on the Turkish side of the border. 
PKK militants have bases in remote mountainous areas in northern Iraq, near the borders with Turkey and Iran.
Also Monday, the Turkish government announced it will establish a new panel to better co-ordinate efforts to fight terrorism. 
Interior Minister Besir Atalay says the new panel's name will be the Undersecretariat for Public Order and Security.

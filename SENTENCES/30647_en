SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Agriculture Ministry announced a ban Thursday (April 7th) on the export of flour until mid-September in an effort to protect the local market. 
This ban is on top of a recent one on wheat exports, in a bid to stabilise the price of bread. 
It soared by 30% in March due to a poor wheat crop and droughts last year. 
To help bring prices down, the government has also decided to release 40,000 tonnes from wheat stocks to sell on the local market.

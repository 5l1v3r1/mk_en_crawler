NEW YORK, United States -- Serbia and Kosovo should put their argument over status aside for the sake of regional development and concentration, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday (January 15th). 
His comments came in a report on UNMIK to the Security Council. 
He urged flexibility in handling Kosovo's participation in international mechanisms and forums that are "essential to the economic and democratic development and the long-term stability of the region". 
According to Ban, the security situation in Kosovo is "relatively calm, but potentially fragile". 
His report will be discussed at a session of the UN Security Council on January 22nd.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) signed an agreement Tuesday (29 October), settling dual citizenship.
Under the deal, residents who have already obtained citizenship in both states would keep it.
Furthermore, dual citizenship would be available if a person has spent more than three years in each country, or one year for spouses of local residents.
The BiH Foreign Ministry does not support the agreement.
Ministry sources say officials there would prefer amendments to the law on citizenship.

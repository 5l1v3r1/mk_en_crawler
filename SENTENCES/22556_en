ZAGREB, Croatia -- The US Embassy in Zagreb says Washington has not paid any reward for information leading to the arrest last month of former Bosnian Serb war crime fugitive Radovan Karadzic. 
Thursday's (August 7th) statement was in response to a report Wednesday, on the Banja Luka-based website Press, which claimed the US State Department paid someone a reward of $5m on July 23rd, just two days after Karadzic`s arrest, as part of the Reward for Justice programme. 
The website, citing "well-informed western diplomatic sources", claimed the money was transferred to a bank account in the Virgin Islands.

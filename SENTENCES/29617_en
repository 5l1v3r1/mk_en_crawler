ATHENS, Greece -- About 20,000 people gathered in downtown Athens on Sunday (May 29th) for another protest against austerity measures. 
This was the fifth day of rallies organised via Facebook following similar demonstrations in Spain. 
According to the media, Sunday's protest was the biggest since the rallies began on Wednesday. 
EU and IMF experts, who are in Greece to evaluate the country's progress and its eligibility to get another tranche of its 110 billion-euro bailout loan, are due to deliver their decision this week. 
On Sunday, the IMF refuted a report in Saturday's edition of the German newspaper Der Spiegel that said the team of international experts has found that Athens missed all its fiscal measures.

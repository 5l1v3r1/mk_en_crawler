PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Montenegrin President-elect Filip Vujanovic said Monday (12 May) that he would call a referendum on independence after three years to give the people a chance to determine their country's future. 
Three years, he said, would be enough to see whether the "atypical" union with Serbia would work. 
Vujanovic also said he believes the EU would accept the results of a referendum held under fair and free conditions. 
In his congratulatory note, however, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said he expects Vujanovic to make "every effort to ensure the full realisation and consolidation of the new state".
The OSCE, meanwhile, reported that Sunday's elections complied with international standards, but noted that the failure of the opposition parties to field a candidate narrowed voters' choices.

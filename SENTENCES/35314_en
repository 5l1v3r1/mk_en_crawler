BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica told reporters on Tuesday (17 February) that he expects to get a mandate to form Serbia's next government by the end of February.
Earlier in the day, Kostunica met with the leaders of the Serbian Renewal Movement and G-17 Plus to discuss the new cabinet and its platform.
The Democratic Party of the late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic did not participate in the negotiations.
The new moderate alliance would thus have to rely on the votes of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists to get its government approved by parliament.
In other news, Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic met on Tuesday with outgoing US Ambassador to Belgrade William Montgomery.
They concluded bilateral relations have improved over the past two years and are now stable.

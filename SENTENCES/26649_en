STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Turkey recalled its ambassador to Sweden after lawmakers there approved a resolution describing as genocide the World War I-era killings of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire.
The vote in the Swedish parliament Thursday (March 11th) was 131-130, the same one-vote margin as in a US congressional committee last week.
As he did after the US House committee vote on a similar resolution, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the Swedish resolution, describing it as "based upon major errors and without foundation".
He also cancelled a planned trip to Stockholm next week.
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt described Thursday's vote as a "mistake" and insisted it would not change Stockholm's longstanding support of Turkey's EU bid.

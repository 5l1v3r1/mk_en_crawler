BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu proposed several amendments to the constitution Wednesday (January 14th). 
He suggested that a single-chamber parliament replace the current two-chamber structure, saying the current ones are similar in terms of representation and election cycles. 
He added membership in the European Parliament is enough to guarantee a good representation of Romanians' general interests and to stop any abuse of power. 
He also proposed lifting the immunity of lawmakers whose actions are punishable under the criminal code. 
Basescu also favours a change to the country's current administrative system, which includes 41 counties and the capital. 
He proposed a new structure consisting of "nine to 12 regions or counties".

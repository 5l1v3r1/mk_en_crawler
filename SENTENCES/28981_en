PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The European Commission (EC) transferred 30m euros to Kosovo earlier this month, authorities in Pristina announced on Wednesday (September 8th).
This is the first batch of aid promised by Brussels at a donor conference for Kosovo held in July 2008.
Another 20m euros has been pledged as macro-financial assistance but will be disbursed when Kosovo meets standards set by the IMF for maintaining fiscal stability, transparency in procurement, and privatisation.
Overall, the EC has promised 508m euros to support Kosovo institutions, in terms of social and economic development.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Serb army sold more than 15 tonnes of explosives to a Serbian firm on Tuesday (25 November). 
The deal with the Prva Iskra Baric chemical company has been approved by SFOR. 
The transaction was part of efforts to rid the 6,600-strong Bosnian Serb army of surplus explosives and equipment. 
There were no buyers for the arms at an auction in August. 
Republika Srpska has until the end of the year to sell the equipment. 
Any unsold arms would be destroyed after that.

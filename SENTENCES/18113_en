BELGRADE, Serbia -- The chairman of the government co-ordination body for southern Serbia, Rasim Ljajic, denounced on Friday (June 15th) a demand by former ethnic Albanian guerrillas to merge the so-called Presevo Valley with Kosovo.
It came during a rally of veterans of the disbanded Liberation Army for Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja, held in Presevo earlier Friday.
Ljajic said the request is unacceptable to both Serbia and the international community, and that all problems in southern Serbia must be resolved solely within the framework of the democratisation and local government reform processes.
Southern Serbia receives more investment than any other area in the country, he added.

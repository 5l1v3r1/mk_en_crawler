SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The NATO HQ Commander in BiH, US Brigadier General Louis Weber, reaffirmed the readiness of the Alliance to react immediately if the location of fugitives Radovan Karadzic or Ratko Mladic is established. 
In Tuesday's (27 December) edition of Dnevni avaz, Weber said NATO is continuously working to obtain information on the fugitives' whereabouts. 
He reiterated, however, that the prime responsibility lies with BiH authorities.
Speaking to the BBC late last week, High Representative in BiH Paddy Ashdown stressed the importance of apprehending Karadzic and Mladic, warning that BiH would not enjoy true peace until they are brought to justice.
On Sunday, former Belgrade Police Chief Marko Nicovic told a Montenegrin news agency that Mladic is negotiating his surrender with Serbian authorities. 
Nicovic says Mladic is trying to secure financial support for his family, as well as immunity for those who have helped him over the years.

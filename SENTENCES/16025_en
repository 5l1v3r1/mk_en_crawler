ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament adopted a declaration Tuesday (October 17th) condemning a bill passed by the French Senate that would make it a crime to deny that genocide was committed against Armenians during the waning years of the Ottoman Empire.
The Turkish legislature warned that the draft would harm political, economic and military ties between Turkey and France.
The same day, OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Miklos Haraszti urged French lawmakers not to endorse the controversial bill in the second reading, saying it raised serious concerns "with regard to international standards of freedom of expression".
In other news Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was hospitalised for around nine hours, following a drop in his blood sugar levels.
Doctors later blamed it on exhaustion and Ramadan fasting.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney says Washington will remain strongly engaged in BiH defence reform and institution strengthening.
In an interview published in Wednesday's (5 July) Dnevni avaz, the diplomat noted that Washington has played a significant role over the past ten years and will continue to support the country, amid plans for reduced international presence and closure of the Office of the High Representative next year.
In other news, High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling urged the BiH presidency Tuesday to ratify the crucial law on reforming the country's armed forces as soon as possible.
He voiced strong concern over the presidency's failure to meet the 1 July deadline for endorsing the plan.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat asked parliament Monday (5 July) to call early elections, since the ruling coalition has lost its majority. 
Talat's Republican Turkish Party (CTP) and the Democrat Party now have 23 votes in the 50-seat chamber after two CTP deputies broke ranks to become independents. 
Talks with an opposition party failed last week. 
The assembly of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state is expected to vote on the motion Thursday.

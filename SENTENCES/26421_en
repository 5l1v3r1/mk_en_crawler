BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor said on Thursday (February 11th) his country will approve the opening of at least two more negotiation chapters in Zagreb's EU accession talks next week. 
Pahor, speaking on the sidelines of the EU summit in Brussels, did not specify which chapters. 
Croatian media reports suggest they would be on fisheries and the environment.
Separately Thursday, Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor announced that the Netherlands is now open to starting negotiations on the judiciary and fundamental rights chapter. 
Before the chapter can be closed, however, Amsterdam insists on Zagreb's full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal and the turning over of missing war documents known as the "artillery diaries" related to 1995's Operation Storm.

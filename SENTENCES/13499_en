BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Monday (27 March) praised Bulgaria and Romania for reforms aimed at strengthening their market economies.
Bulgaria awarded 65m euros yearly in state aid to firms in 2002-2004, or 0.36 per cent of its GDP.
This was well below the 1.35 per cent of GDP registered by ten East European nations that joined the EU in 2004, and below the EU average of 0.49 per cent.
Romania's subsidies averaged 981m euros, or 1.86 per cent of GDP, in 2002-2004.
Also Monday, Malta became the latest country to call for Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU as scheduled on 1 January 2007.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin visited the capital, Valeta, on Monday.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Greece handed over to Croatia on Wednesday (April 30th) ethnic Serbs Ernest Radjen and Dusan Maslovar, sought by Zagreb for war crimes against civilians during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Radjen will face trial in Zadar for suspected involvement in a 1991 massacre of around 50 civilians in that area.
Maslovar is under investigation by a court in the town of Sisak.
Croatia demanded the extradition of both suspects in 2006.

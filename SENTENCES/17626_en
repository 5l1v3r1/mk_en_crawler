THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal's Trial Chamber announced on Friday (January 26th) that it has revoked the provisional release of indicted Croatian Generals Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. 
The court wants them back at the Scheveningen detention unit by February 8th. 
The two were indicted in 2004 on nine counts of crimes against humanity, violation of the customs of war and crimes committed against Serbs during the Croatian military's 1995 Operation Storm in Krajina. 
Granted provisional release in December 2004, the generals' trial is expected to begin in May.

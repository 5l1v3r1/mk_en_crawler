ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul is working to defuse growing tensions between the government and the judiciary. 
He issued a statement Monday (May 26th) warning the row could harm Turkey's reputation, solidarity and stability. 
He intervened following a series of angry exchanges between the Supreme Court of Appeals Board of Chairmen and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which insists the courts lack the authority to make political statements.
Monday evening, Gul met with Supreme Court of Appeals President Hasan Gerceker. 
Gul reportedly tried to ease tensions, at least until the Constitutional Court rules on a controversial headscarf case next week.

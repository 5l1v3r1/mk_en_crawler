ANKARA, Turkey -- The Higher Election Board (YSK) announced on Wednesday (March 2nd) that plans to enable Turks living abroad to vote at Turkish embassies and consulates by residence cannot be implemented in time for the June 12th parliamentary elections due to shortcomings in technical infrastructure.
Turks living in foreign countries can only vote at Turkey's border gates, and therefore will need to afford the time and money to travel to Turkey to vote.
The decision is final and cannot be reversed.
From Germany, where he was visiting, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the decision is a blow to the civil liberties of Turks abroad.
He says the YSK is apparently trying to sabotage the government.
The majority of Turks living abroad come from rural Turkish regions, the typical voter profile of the ruling Justice and Development Party.

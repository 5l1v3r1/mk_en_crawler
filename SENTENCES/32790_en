BUCHAREST, Romania -- On Friday (6 December), a delegation of the EBRD presented an economic analysis of Romania's transition process. 
The report cited a favourable growth outlook, an improved insurance market, and the expanding role of mortgage loans. 
The Bank also noted some improvement in the process of fighting corruption but said influence on the business sector remains strong. 
Privatisation remains a key challenge for the country, together with legislative reforms affecting domestic and foreign investments.
In other news, police in Bucharest last week arrested suspected drug trafficking boss Turhan Ekrem. 
A Turkish citizen, he is suspected of transporting heroin from Turkey to Western Europe using established transit links in Romania.

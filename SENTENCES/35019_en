SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Local media reported Sunday (30 November) that the Muslim member of the country's tripartite presidency would testify for the prosecution in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague.
According to unconfirmed reports, Sulejman Tihic is due to appear before the UN tribunal on Tuesday.
Captured when Serb forces overran his native town of Bosanski Samac, Tihic spent time in five prison camps.
He is also expected to hold talks with the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 450 bodies have been discovered so far at a mass grave near the village of Kamenica, a prosecutor said Friday (November 16th).
Officials said they were expecting to excavate at least another 100 human remains from the site.
Documents found on some of the bodies proved they were Muslim victims of the Srebrenica massacre.
This is the ninth mass grave to be discovered in Kamenica.
In other news, Switzerland has announced plans to deport seven individuals, who fought on the Muslim side in the 1992-1995 conflict, to BiH.
The men were said to be staying in Switzerland illegally.
According to unconfirmed reports, they are Moroccans and Tunisians.

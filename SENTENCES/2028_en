A candidate in the recent Croatian presidential election is under investigation for possible links to retired general Ante Gotovina, one of the UN war crimes tribunal's three most-wanted indictees. 
The candidate, retired Croatian Army General Ljubo Cesic Rojs, has openly admitted helping Gotovina and his family.
During campaign speeches, Rojs -- one of Croatia's wealthiest men, with assets totalling at least 60m euros -- repeatedly said he knows where Gotovina is located and is in daily contact with the fugitive.
"He [Gotovina] is well and in good health and I can tell you that he greets all of you," Rojs, who went on to receive less than 3 per cent of the vote, told supporters. 
As a result of his statements, Rojs was placed on the EU's blacklist of persons prohibited from entering member states of the Union.
His claims also attracted the interest of the police. 
With its bid for EU membership hinging on full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, and particularly on the arrest and handover of Gotovina, authorities urgently need to locate the former general, who is believed to be receiving aid from a network of supporters. 
The case is an obstacle to what are otherwise considered extremely favourable prospects for EU accession.
Brussels has advised the Croatian government to monitor the activities of Gotovina's associates and other people with suspected links to him.
Despite his boasts at campaign rallies, however, Rojs has so far provided little of interest to police. 
He now claims to have been speaking of Ante Gotovina Jr, the indictee's son.
"They asked me when the last time I saw Ante Gotovina was. 
I told them last Friday morning at the creative development school, when I took my son," Rojs said.
The interior ministry, in co-operation with the state prosecutor, is continuing its investigation.

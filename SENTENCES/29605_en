WASHINGTON, United States -- The Commission on Security and Co-operation in Europe (US Helsinki Commission) believes that the political tension in Albania after the May 8th local elections is a continuation of the political crisis that began in 2009, media in Tirana reported on Monday (May 30th).
In 2009, the main opposition Socialist Party refused to accept election results and claimed that the ruling Democratic Party won via manipulations.
In a communique published on its official website, the US Helsinki Commission said that this month's local elections had been a chance to ensure stability, but unfortunately, proved to be the continuation of the crisis.
The commission will discuss the elections process this week in Washington where a report will be presented by Jonathan Stonestreet, head of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Albania.

TIRANA, Albania -- Campaigning for the February 18th municipal elections began with big weekend rallies at the Tirana Palace of Congresses by the ruling Democratic Party on Saturday (January 20th) and by the main opposition Socialist Party on Sunday. 
According to local media reports, each party began by accusing the other of causing the month-long postponement of the elections.
The media also reported that an incident marred the start of the election campaign of the Greek minority Union for Human Rights Party (UHRP) in the mainly ethnic Greek-populated city of Himara on Sunday. 
Three individuals were arrested for obstructing a speech by the UHRP candidate for Himara mayor, Vasil Bollano, who is running for a second term.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has increased its humanitarian aid to address a possible fresh wave of immigrants seeking to escape neighbouring Syria, amid turmoil there, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a TV interview Sunday (May 1st). 
"We have opened the border crossing with Syria. 
â¦ We cannot close the door to them. 
But, we have also taken a series of measures," Erdogan stated, though did not elaborate. 
Over 250 Syrians have entered Turkey since Friday, scrambling through barbed wire at the border. 
Erdogan said they have been given shelter.

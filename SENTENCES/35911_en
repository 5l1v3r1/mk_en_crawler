SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The intelligence agency plans to increase the number of ethnic Albanian employees next month, according to a report Friday (16 January) in the daily <I>Fakti</I>.
The move is in line with the Ohrid Peace Accord's provision for proportional representation of all ethnic communities in state institutions.
Of the 230 agency's current employees, only seven are ethnic Albanians.
In other news Friday, the major opposition party VMRO-DPMNE said it plans to move for a no confidence vote against Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski.
The party says Jordanovski ignores the opposition and often excludes it from debate.

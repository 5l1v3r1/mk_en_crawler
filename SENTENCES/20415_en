SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- The Office of the High Representative (OHR) said at the weekend that High Representative Miroslav Lajcak will no longer address the police reform issue and is leaving it in the hands of local politicians. 
"All deadlines have passed and we will set no new deadlines," Lajcak spokesman Frane Maroevic said. 
He did, however, praise the latest proposal, drafted by HDZ leader Dragan Covic and HDZ 1990 leader Bozo Ljubic, calling it "a responsible and sincere attempt to reach a compromise". 
The process has dragged on for two years.
Faced with the threat of sanctions against politicians and parties, Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, Haris Silajdzic, met on Sunday (October 13th) in Banja Luka. 
They agreed to actively co-operate for the fast adoption and implementation of EU-related reforms. 
However, neither mentioned police reform specifically.
At a news conference Sunday, Sulejman Tihic, leader of a main party in the Federation of BiH, said he hopes the EU will identify who is responsible for the failure of the police reform process. 
He also suggested that the issue could be resolved with a change in the BiH Constitution.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The World Bank Board of Governors has sent official confirmation that Kosovo is the newest member of the financial institution, local media reported on Thursday (June 4th). 
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci described it as a success for Kosovo, its institutions and its citizens. 
In early April, Kosovo was invited to join the IMF as well. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu said these memberships will provide new opportunities for development and will help Kosovo solve challenges arising from the global economic crisis.
In other news Thursday, the fifth time was the charm, as parliament elected Sami Kurteshi to serve as the country's new ombudsman, after four previous failures. 
The Office of the Ombudsman has not been fully operational since Marek Nowicki, an appointee of the international community, left the job four years ago.

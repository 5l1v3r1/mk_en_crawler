ATHENS, Greece -- Seamen announced on Thursday (April 22nd) plans to hold a 24-hour strike Monday, to protest the government's decision to lift cabotage -- travel along the coast -- restrictions for foreign cruise ships, in a bid to boost tourism. 
But the sailors argue this step will damage their sector. 
"Lifting cabotage restrictions in cruise shipping means job losses," the Pan-Hellenic Seamen Federation said in a statement. 
Another protest is planned for May 1st.

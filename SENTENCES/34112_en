TIRANA, Albania -- Foreign Minister Ilir Meta handed in his resignation Friday (18 July). 
Meta said that his decision was motivated by Prime Minister Fatos Nano's efforts to undermine the work of his ministry. 
Meta, a former prime minister himself, spoke highly of the ministry's work over the past six months and dismissed accusations of underperformance during a review that followed his resignation. 
Nano described Meta's decision as unexpected but insisted the government would continue to work at full speed.

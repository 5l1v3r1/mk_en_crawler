NEW YORK, United States -- Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul agreed on Monday (18 September) to discuss a new set of confidence-building measures during Gul's visit to Athens in October.
The two are attending the UN General Assembly's annual session in New York this week.
Meanwhile, Greek President Karolos Papoulias called on Turkey to withdraw its troops from northern Cyprus.
In an interview with the German press, given prior to the start of his formal five-day visit to Germany, Papoulias say Turkey could not enter the EU while maintaining "occupation forces" on another member's territory.

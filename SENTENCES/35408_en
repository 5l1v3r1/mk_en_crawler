SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament voted Friday (13 February) to formally approve the country's bid for membership in the EU.
Lawmakers voted to authorise Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva to submit Skopje's application to the Irish presidency of the EU later this month, in hopes integration will bolster economic prosperity and political stability.
Macedonia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Brussels in 2001.
During a visit to Macedonia on Friday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel pledged his country's support for Skopje's integration effort.

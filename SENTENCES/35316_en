SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A new poll conducted by BBSS Gallup suggests that the left-wing opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) could win 51 per cent of the seats in parliament if elections were held now. 
BSP is receiving support from 23 per cent of respondents, the poll found. 
However, when adjustments for non-voters and undecided voters were made, BSP emerged with the chance to secure an absolute parliamentary majority. 
The right-wing opposition party Union of Democratic Forces is trailing BSP with 9 per cent, or 20 per cent of seats in the hypothetical parliament. 
The ruling National Movement Simeon II is managing only 7 per cent, which adds up to 15.6 per cent of the parliamentary seats.

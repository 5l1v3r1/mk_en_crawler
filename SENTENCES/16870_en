ATHENS, Greece -- The leaders of Russia, Greece, and Bulgaria have agreed to give the go-ahead to a project to build an oil pipeline between Burgas and Alexandroupolis. 
President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and President Georgi Parvanov decided that a formal agreement to begin the much-delayed project should be signed by the three countries before the end of the year. 
Putin hailed the project as one that would build closer ties with Greece and Bulgaria and will facilitate oil deliveries to the Mediterranean region, bypassing the narrow Bosporus straits. 
A sticking point has been the division of stakes in the consortium.

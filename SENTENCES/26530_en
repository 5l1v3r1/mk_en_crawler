ANKARA, Turkey -- The stock of Turkey's biggest media holding, Dogan, plummeted about 20% in trading Wednesday (September 9th), a day after announcing it had been slapped with a record fine of 1.75 billion euros for tax evasion.
Tax authorities imposed it after inspecting the company's accounts between 2005 and 2007.
Dogan, which controls more than half of Turkey's private media market, says the move was politically motivated.
Recently, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the way Dogan's media outlets cover his government's policies.

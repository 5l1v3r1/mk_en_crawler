ANKARA, Turkey -- Tourism and Culture Minister Erkan Mumcu resigned from the cabinet Tuesday (15 February), citing policy disagreements.
Often described as the rising star of Turkish politics, the 41-year-old minister was known as a secular and moderate.
He openly clashed with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan over plans to lift a ban on wearing headscarves at public functions and opposed the short-lived effort to make adultery a criminal offence.
In other news, police clashed with Kurd demonstrators Tuesday who were commemorating the sixth anniversary of the capture of Kurdish terrorist leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Unrest was reported in Istanbul, Izmir, Diyarbakir and Mersin.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou on Tuesday (February 2nd) urged the public and politicians to support a series of austerity measures to bring the country out of grave financial crisis.
"This is an effort to stop the country's course towards the cliff," said Papandreou on television.
He added that that a freeze in the salaries of public sector employees and fuel duty increases are key to economic recovery.
He also proposed raising the age of retirement while pledging to prosecute tax evaders.
The European Commission discussed Greece's plan Wednesday and backed it, despite reservations.
The BBC reports EU Economic Commissioner Joaqu√≠n Almunia launched an infringement procedure, to ensure Greek authorities report reliable budgetary statistics.

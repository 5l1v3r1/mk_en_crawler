SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The interior ministry said on Wednesday (February 16th) that charges have been filed against 60 people involved in ethnic clashes at a Skopje fortress Sunday. 
Eight people, including two policemen, were injured when ethnic Macedonian and Albanian youth brawled over plans to build a museum-church on the site of the Kale Fortress. 
Meanwhile, the main opposition SDSM accused the ruling coalition of inciting inter-ethnic tensions. 
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE says the SDSM is using the incident to make political points.

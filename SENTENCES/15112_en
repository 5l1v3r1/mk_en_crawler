ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government announced on Wednesday (30 November) that it is launching a new media campaign to persuade refugees from the 1991-1995 conflict to return to their homes.
The drive, dubbed "Croatia -- home to all of its citizens", kicks off Thursday with ads on radio and television stations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro.
Billboards with messages to refugees will be put up in all three countries.
The campaign will run for 15 days.

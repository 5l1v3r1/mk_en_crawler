ATHENS, Greece -- Police used tear gas Thursday (April 29th) to disperse several hundred protestors who gathered outside the Finance Ministry building in Athens, demonstrating against government austerity measures.
The protestors, mainly supporters of the opposition left-wing Syriza party, carried signs criticising the IMF.
Witnesses say demonstrators tried to break through a police cordon to enter the ministry's building, and pelted security officials with plastic bottles.

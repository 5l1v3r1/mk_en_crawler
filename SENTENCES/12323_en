SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A joint medical team from Albania, Croatia and Macedonia that will be deployed with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan this year staged a drill at the Ilinden barracks in Skopje on Wednesday (11 May).
According to the Macedonian co-ordinator, Colonel Obrad Rosic, NATO representatives who were present called the exercise a success.
The three countries, signatories of the so-called Adriatic Charter, sealed a memorandum last month on deploying the 12-member medical team to Afghanistan.

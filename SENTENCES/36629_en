BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR troops arrested the former police chief of Bijeljina, a police spokesman said Saturday (31 July).
In June, Mile Pejcic was accused of helping war crimes indictees evade justice;
international community High Representative Paddy Ashdown subsequently fired him.
SFOR has made no comment on Saturday's arrest.
NATO-led peacekeepers also searched the police precinct in Bijeljina on Saturday, searching for evidence of activities that violate the Dayton Peace Agreement.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Customs officers at the Novo Selo border checkpoint with Yugoslavia discovered a small arsenal of weapons and ammunition hidden in the car of a Greek man. 
The Interior Ministry said Monday (2 December) that the haul included a grenade launcher, AK-47 assault rifles and pistols.
In other news, more than 2,000 people took to the streets of Sofia on Monday to protest the government's commitment to the EU to close two reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in 2006. 
The protesters demanded a referendum on the future of the plant. 
Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg's cabinet survived two no-confidence motions over the same issue Friday.

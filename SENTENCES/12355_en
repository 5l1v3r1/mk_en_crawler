BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Top Serbian and Serbia-Montenegro officials held an urgent meeting Tuesday (11 January) concerning the situation in southern Serbia.
The meeting follows an incident in which Serbian border guards shot and killed an ethnic Albanian teenager who was trying to illegally cross the border into Macedonia at the weekend.
According to media reports in Belgrade, Tuesday's talks ended with a decision to restructure the Serbian government's co-ordination centre for the region and to include ethnic Albanian representatives on the panel.

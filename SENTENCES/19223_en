NEW YORK, United States -- The need for regional stability in Southeastern Europe was the main topic of discussion between Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha and UN General Assembly President Srgjan Kerim at UN headquarters in New York on Monday (January 28th). 
The two officials exchanged views about recent developments and progress on the path to Euro-Atlantic structures. 
Kerim praised Albania for its "constructive engagement in efforts to promote regional stability".
On Tuesday, Basha is expected to brief US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the course of political and military reforms Albania is implementing as part of efforts to receive an invitation to join NATO in April.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Parliamentary President Predrag Markovic said Saturday (10 July) that local elections would likely take place on 12 September or 19 September. 
Milos Todorovic of the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, the major local monitoring organisation, shed some light on the procedure. 
"In accordance with existing laws, the mayor will be appointed by parliamentary representatives," Todorovic said, adding that the way in which officials are elected is a political matter, and that his organisation is only interested in ensuring the elections are fair and run smoothly. 
The last local elections were in September 2000.

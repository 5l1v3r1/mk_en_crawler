PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The government commission on missing persons launched an online inquiry centre Monday (February 28th) that will assist authorities in efforts to find missing people. 
Prenk Gjetaj, the head of the commission, said that there are 1,821 people who went missing during and after the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict. 
He says one approach is to draft a strategy specifically for human remains in the Pristina morgue. 
The government commission, the International Commission on Missing Persons, EULEX representatives, and families of the missing met in Pristina to discuss developments.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Boyko Borisov accepted the resignation of Health Minister Bozhidar Nanev on Wednesday (March 31st), a day after prosecutors charged him in connection with medicine supply deals that caused about 1.75m euros in losses to the state.
In his resignation, Nanev insisted the charges are unfounded, and said the deals in question were the only possible course of action at the time, to secure the necessary supplies.

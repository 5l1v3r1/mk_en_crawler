SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic will be brought to justice when they are caught, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes said in an interview published on Tuesday (January 2nd).
If the two fugitives are found before 2010, the UN tribunal will remain open until their cases are heard, Clint Williamson said.
Some other international body will have to be found to try them if they are apprehended after that date, he added.
Under the current schedule, the tribunal is set to complete all cases by 2008 and wrap up appeals by 2010.
"The only absolutely unacceptable thing for the government of the United States is for them to be tried, for example, in Belgrade -- that is, before local courts," Williamson explained.

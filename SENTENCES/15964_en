SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgarian police announced on Saturday (November 18th) that they have detained a 30-year old man from Shumen, suspected of having made a bomb threat against the state-run news agency BTA the previous day.
During a call to BTA, the suspect represented himself as a member of a group allegedly called "Muslim Brothers".
A search was carried out at the BTA building, but no explosives were found.
Police say the suspect has made terror threats against five targets across the country in the last four months, including Sofia Airport and the nuclear power plant in Kozloduy.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Court decided on Tuesday (June 16th) to suspend the corruption case against former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase after his lawyers challenged the constitutionality of National Anti-corruption Directorate (DNA) activities.
Nastase is accused of abuse of power, stemming from an incident where he allegedly gathered funds for his election campaign in 2004 using his position as leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD).
In January, anti-corruption prosecutors charged Nastase with taking more than 230,000 euros from fictive commercial activities.

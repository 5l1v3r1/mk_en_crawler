THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague rejected on Wednesday (November 28th) a request by retired General Ante Gotovina to spend the period leading up to his trial in his home country, Croatia.
The tribunal said Zagreb failed to provide enough guarantees that Gotovina would not be a flight risk.
Gotovina was arrested in the Canary Islands in 2005.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has invited the leaders of BiH's main political parties to an informal seminar in Brussels focusing on reforms related to EU integration and what must be done to seal a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. 
Dragan Covic, leader of the main Croat party -- the Croat Democratic Union (HDZ), indicated on Wednesday (January 9th) the meeting would be held soon.
In a letter, Rehn said he hopes the parties would wrap up work on police reform, which is key to signing the SAA. 
The BiH and the EU initialled the SAA in early December after the parties reached an agreement in principle on the establishment of state-level police. 
Three other requirements are full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, public broadcasting reform and public administration reform.

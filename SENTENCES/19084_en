ZAGREB, Croatia -- The latest poll by the Puls agency suggests the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) remains the most popular party in the country, but its lead is slim.
The HDZ has about 23.1% support, the poll found, compared to 20.4% for the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP).
This is the narrowest lead HDZ has held in a year, according to Puls.
The coalition made up of the Croatian Peasant Party, the Croatian Social Liberal Party and the Region Alliance was third with 10%.

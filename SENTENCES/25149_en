LUXEMBOURG -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said on Tuesday (October 27th) that his country is no longer blocking any negotiating chapters in EU accession talks with Croatia but still objects to some of them.
Zbogar was speaking on the sidelines of the EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
He briefed EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt about progress on an arbitration agreement between the two countries regarding their long-standing border dispute.
Croatia resumed its EU accession process on October 2nd by opening six negotiation chapters and closing five.
However, Ljubljana did not approve opening three other chapters, saying it had nothing to do with the border dispute.

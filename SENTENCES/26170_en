ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou unveiled a four-year plan Monday (December 14th) to reduce the country's crushing budget deficit and bring its soaring debts under control.
Speaking to business and trade union leaders, Papandreou said that over the next three months, the government will make decisions that have been avoided for decades.
Following this quarter of national dialogue regarding possible measures, the government will shift into action, which is what the financial markets want to see, Papandreou stressed.
The roadmap envisions drastic cuts in public sector costs.
Additionally, bonuses that private banks award their employees will be taxed at a rate of 90%, while in 2010, a hiring freeze will be slapped on the public sector.
Additionally, one third of Greek tourism offices abroad will be closed.
Also targeted will be the employment of illegal immigrants in Greece.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The State Election Commission (SEC) is expected to present the final results of the local elections Wednesday (16 March) amid controversy over the hotly contested race for Skopje mayor.
The government and the opposition are exchanging accusations over alleged attempts to manipulate the results.
The opposition insists that independent candidate Trifun Kostovski, who was backed by most Macedonian opposition parties, won a first-round victory against incumbent Skopje Mayor Risto Penov, the ruling coalition's nominee.
A SEC statement on Tuesday, however, gave Kostovski 48.6 per cent of the vote.
That is below the threshold needed to avoid a runoff against Penov on 27 March.

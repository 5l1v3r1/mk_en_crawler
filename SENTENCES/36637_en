THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal rejected a request Friday (30 July) by Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj for temporary release.
Though his proceedings are not expected to begin until 2007, Seselj has been behind bars for 15 months.
His lawyers are insisting that he be released on bail until the start of the trial.
Also Friday, the tribunal decided to grant early release to Bosnian Croat Ante Furundzija.
Sentenced to 10 years in 1998, he has served two-thirds of his sentence.
He was convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in BiH.

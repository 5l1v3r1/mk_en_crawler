BELGRADE, Serbia -- Milos Klaric, a Serb refugee from Croatia, says his missing father, Dusan Klaric, appears in video footage that surfaced recently showing mistreatment of Serb civilians at the hands of Croatian and Bosniak paramilitary troops during Croatia's Operation Storm in 1995.
Milos, who fled the family home in Krajina 15 years ago and has been living in Serbia ever since, told Belgrade media on Sunday (13 August) that his father had been reluctant to leave their home village Kordonski Leskovac and likely remained in Croatia as long as he could.
BiH, Croatian and Serbian prosecutions agreed last week to co-operate in the investigation of cases of alleged war crimes committed against ethnic Serb civilians in Krajina.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) will hold a rally in front of parliament Friday (25 August), as lawmakers vote on the new cabinet of Prime Minister-designate Nikola Gruevski.
DUI's central board made the decision at the weekend, to voice continued dissatisfaction with its exclusion from the new government.
The party received the most votes among ethnic Albanians in the 5 July parliamentary elections.
DUI has not announced whether it would accept a proposal from its ally, the minor Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), for a complete boycott of the legislature.
A few days ago, the EU envoy in Skopje, Erwan Fouere, urged DUI and PDP to play a constructive role in opposition.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (11 March) sentenced a Bosnian Serb to 18 years in prison for atrocities he committed against Muslims in the Brcko area in 1992.
Following a deal with prosecutors, Ranko Cesic pleaded guilty to 12 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
He admitted to killing 10 individuals over a period of 32 days at a camp called Luka.
In other news Thursday, the UN tribunal lifted a gag order imposed on Slobodan Milosevic.
The defendant's communications had been restricted during the November elections in Serbia.
Milosevic was warned, however, that he is not entitled to any direct contacts with the media.
The gag order on Serbian Radical Party leader and war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj apparently remains in place.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- The panel working for months now to draft the constitution of the new Yugoslav federation will most likely come up with a final text on Saturday (28 December), said the chairman of Wednesday's session, Zoran Zizic of Montenegro's Socialist People's Party.
The most problematic issue remains representation of the looser federation before international organisations.
Meanwhile, the ruling parties in Montenegro have not yet agreed on members of the cabinet.
But expectations are high that it will fall into place Thursday.

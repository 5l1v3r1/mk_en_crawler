BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu sent a letter Monday (October 15th) to the two chambers of parliament warning he would organise a national referendum unless the new electoral law introducing a single-vote system is presented to him for ratification by October 22nd.
The main political parties agreed in August to reform the current outdated electoral system to make it more accountable to voters.
Later, however, the Social Democratic Party changed its mind, while the Democrats conditioned their vote on a special electoral voting map.

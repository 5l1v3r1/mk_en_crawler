BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- One soldier was killed and 12 others injured during a military exercise at Kraljevo barracks in central Serbia Thursday night (17 July).
According to some sources, a hand grenade exploded.
Other sources say a practice missile was replaced with a real one in a rocket launcher.
The mishap prompted Defence Minister Boris Tadic to fire four senior army officials.
It also forced him to postpone a meeting this week with counterparts from Bulgaria and Macedonia.
The talks were to focus on regional security and co-operation in the area of defence, as well as joint NATO integration efforts.

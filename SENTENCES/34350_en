MADRID, Spain -- Turkey will donate $50m for the reconstruction of Iraq from 2004 to 2007, Turkish special representative to Iraq Osman Koruturk said Friday (24 October) at the international donors conference in Madrid. 
Turkey will also contribute $2m to the new international fund for reconstruction this year. 
Ankara already has spent $5m in post-war Iraq, building two hospitals and sending humanitarian aid. 
Koruturk said the aid underscores the importance Turkey attaches to Iraq's stabilisation and development.

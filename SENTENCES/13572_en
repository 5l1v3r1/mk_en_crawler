TIRANA, Albania -- Meeting on Tuesday (22 November), members of the Albanian Parliament's foreign affairs committee and representatives of the Greek government agreed that the so-called Cham issue would not affect bilateral relations. 
Earlier this month, Greek President Karolos Papoulias cut short a visit to the Albanian town of Saranda amid demonstrations by representatives of the Cham Albanians, who were expelled from Greece after World War II. 
Demonstrators demanded compensation for lost property and the right to return to Greece. 
Athens blamed Tirana for failing to prevent the demonstration.
In other news, Tirana is hosting the 26th session of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Parliamentary Assembly this week. 
Participants are focusing on issues related to crime fighting and co-operation in the fields of science and technology.

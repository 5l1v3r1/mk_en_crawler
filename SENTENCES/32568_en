TIRANA, Albania -- Leaders of the ruling Socialist Party decided Wednesday (5 March) that all parties must agree on whether to establish a commission to investigate Tirana Mayor Edi Rama.
Gramoz Ruci, the head of the Socialists' caucus, says a common position is possible if all sides respect the constitution and the law.
The opposition Democratic Party had demanded formation of the panel to look into Rama's alleged misappropriations of budgetary and municipal funds.
The Socialists objected, saying the proposed commission would breach the constitution.

VIENNA, Austria -- Parliament on Thursday (November 18th) ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia, the 10th of 27 EU members to do so. 
Johann Mayer, head of the Austria-Serbia parliamentary group, said his country will help accelerate Serbia's accession into the EU, which he says would help ensure stability and co-operation in the Western Balkans. 
Mayer added that it is now up to Serbia to quickly bring its legislation in line with the acquis communautaire, as well as make economic, political and institutional progress.
Overall, ratification of the SAA with Serbia has moved along at a steady clip since the EU commission unlocked the process in June. 
Serbia must capture wartime fugitives Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic before any further integration progress is allowed by the EU.

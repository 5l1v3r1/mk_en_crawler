BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawyers representing former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic lodged an appeal Friday (July 25th) against his extradition to The Hague war crimes tribunal.
The document was filed at the last minute as the deadline expired at midnight to avoid its "immediate delivery" to the tribunal, Serbian media quoted Karadzic's lawyer, Svetozar Vujacic, as saying on Saturday.
Serbia's war crimes court will have three days to review the appeal before the justice ministry issues a final order regarding Karadzic's transfer to The Hague.
In other news Saturday, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic described full co-operation with The Hague as an obligation that is directly linked to protecting the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
In an interview with Beta, he added he now expects the EU to ease its conditions for Serbia's accession.

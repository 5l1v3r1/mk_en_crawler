BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia is ready to offer to Iraq newer warplanes for its air force as well as specialists to train local pilots, to compensate for a set of Saddam-era fighter jets that were sent to Belgrade for repair back in 1989.
The planes were never fixed, given the situation in the country during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, and are now deemed useless.
"These planes have not been overhauled and they are not in flying condition," Army chief-of-staff General Miloje Miletic said on Friday (September 4th), adding that the army is contemplating "another solution".
A week ago, an Iraqi delegation was in Belgrade to bring back the 19 Russian-made fighter planes.
Before collapsing in the 1990s, the former Yugoslavia was an important weapons supplier for Iraq.

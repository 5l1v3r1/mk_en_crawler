ZAGREB, Croatia -- As expected, parliament on Friday (April 23rd) abolished the crisis tax on income ahead of schedule, at the government's request.
The additional 2% levied on taxable income of between 415 and 820 euros will be removed as of July 1st, while the 4% tax on incomes higher than 820 euros will be scrapped as of November 1st.
The government introduced the tax in August to boost revenues.
It was originally intended to remain in force until the end of this year.

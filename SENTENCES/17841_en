TIRANA, Albania -- President Alfred Moisiu on Thursday (February 22nd) called for a faster vote count and speedy completion of the elections process so that newly elected officials can begin their work immediately. 
Municipal elections were held on Sunday. 
The president admitted that a lack of trust among the main parties and constant confrontations in the run up to the vote marred the process, but noted there were bright spots, such as independent media coverage.
In other news Thursday, the leaders of four religious communities announced an initiative to establish the Albanian Inter-Religious Council. 
The project, backed by Anastasios Yannoulatos, head of the Orthodox Church, Rrok Mirdita, head of the Catholic Church, Haxhi Dede Reshat Bardhi, head of the Bektashi community and Selim Muca, head of the Muslim community, is aimed at facilitating peaceful co-existence and understanding among the communities.

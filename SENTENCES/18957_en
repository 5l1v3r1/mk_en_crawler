ZAGREB, Croatia -- The BiH-Croatian Interstate Council held its 11th session in Zagreb on Saturday (March 3rd), and listed the issues that must be resolved bilaterally. 
The Council, which includes Croatia's President Stipe Mesic and the members of the tripartite BiH Presidency -- Nebojsa Radmanovic, Zeljko Komsic and Haris Silajdzic -- concluded that issues such as border demarcation, the Ploce port's status and property ownership in the border regions should be forwarded to the governments in Zagreb and Sarajevo and fast-tracked. 
A joint statement issued by Mesic and his Bosnian counterparts also pledged that BiH and Croatia would back each other on the road to Euro-Atlantic integration.

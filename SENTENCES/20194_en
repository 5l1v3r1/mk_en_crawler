ZAGREB, Croatia -- President Stipe Mesic criticised the protected environmental fishing zone (ZERP) in the Adriatic on Wednesday (February 13th), saying that Croatia must choose between preserving the ZERP in its current form and EU accession. 
Until now, Mesic has maintained a diplomatic tone, as the ruling coalition defends the ZERP despite opposition from neighbouring Slovenia and the European Commission. 
Now that EU accession negotiations might stall over the ZERP, Mesic is speaking up. 
He said on Wednesday the idea that the protected zone could exist parallel to EU membership is a delusion.

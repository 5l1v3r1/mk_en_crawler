TIRANA, Albania -- Minister of European Integration Arenca Trashani told the press Sunday (28 May) that Albania's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU will be signed on 12 June.
The date has been mentioned before by Albanian officials, but not officially confirmed.
Trashani also stressed the importance of the so-called Intermediary Accord taking effect:
It is the economic part of the SAA.
According to Trashani, it would mean "all Albanians will have less customs tariffs, greater flux of goods exchanges between contracting parties, and a drop in the prices of goods." Albania began the SAA negotiations in January 2002.

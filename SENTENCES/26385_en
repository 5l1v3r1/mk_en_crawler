ANKARA, Turkey -- A navy colonel has been arrested for involvement in an alleged plot against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Colonel Dursun Cicek was detained late Wednesday (November 11th) after he was questioned by prosecutors in Istanbul.
His signature appeared on a secret document outlining plans to destabilise the AKP.
The document was published in June by a local newspaper.
Cicek was briefly detained in early July on charges of membership in an illegal organisation and conspiring to discredit the government.
He has denied the accusations.
In other news, Court of Appeals Chairman Judge Hasan Gerceker said on Thursday that the court is investigating allegations that the government illegally tapped the telephones of top judges and other judiciary officials.
According to media reports, the justice ministry ordered the wiretaps as part of an investigation into a plot to overthrow the government.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic has received death threats, the newspaper Blic said in an article published Monday (May 5th). 
It said the threats intensified considerably following Kosovo's proclamation of independence in February and Tadic's decision to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU last week. 
According to Blic, the letters come from Chicago, the point of origin for other threatening letters received by Serbian ministers and court officials.
Serbia's public prosecution confirmed it is aware of the situation, and said it was doing everything within its legal power to protect the president and find those that sent the threats.

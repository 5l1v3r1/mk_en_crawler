BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government collapsed Tuesday (October 13th) as parliament approved a no-confidence motion filed by a group of opposition parties on October 6th. 
This is the first time in Romania's post-communist history that a government has been ousted in a no-confidence procedure.
The vote, initiated by the National Liberal Party (PNL), the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR), was supported by 258 lawmakers in the 471-seat parliament. 
It accused the government of Prime Minister Emil Boc of having caused political instability, impoverishing the population, and planting seeds of "electoral fraud" in favour of President Traian Basescu in the upcoming presidential election.
The motion also criticises a governmental decision to hold a referendum requested by Basescu on introducing a one-house parliament, which would reduce the number of seats by over 170. 
According to the authors of the document, Boc's government and President Basescu have thrown Romania into an economic crisis.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian government adopted a bill Thursday (15 December) granting amnesty to those who faced criminal charges for failing to fulfil their obligation to serve as army conscripts. 
Those who already served such sentences would have their records expunged. 
Approximately, 2,500 criminal proceedings will be abolished as a result of the measure.
In other news, the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters, is expected to discuss Friday the standards and rules concerning Montenegro's independence referendum. 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's administration hopes to hold it next year.

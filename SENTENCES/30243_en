TIRANA, Albania -- The Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) announced plans on Sunday (December 19th) to run in the April 2011 local elections with the ruling Democratic Party.
Deputy SMI leader and Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto confirmed the co-operation during a party congress in Elbasan.
"These elections are very important preparation for the next general elections [in 2012]," Haxhinasto said, adding that the SMI expects good results during the local vote.
The SMI joined the Democratic Party in the government in mid-2009 after a third place showing in general elections behind the main opposition Socialist Party.

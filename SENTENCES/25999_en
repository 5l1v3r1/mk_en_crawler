NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Security Council discussed on Thursday (October 15th) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's latest report on Kosovo.
Participants in the debate urged both Belgrade and Pristina to improve their communication for the well-being of all Kosovo citizens.
For his part, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic urged UN member states not to recognise Kosovo until the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issues its opinion on the subject.
The ICJ is due to start hearings on the legality of Kosovo's independence on December 1st.
In turn, Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni accused Belgrade of obstructing Pristina's efforts to integrate Kosovo Serbs in state institutions.
He reiterated that his government's priority is to guarantee the return of refugees.

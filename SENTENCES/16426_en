BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- The government decided on Wednesday (October 11th) to open the local labour market to Bulgarians and Romanians, following their countries' EU entry on January 1st.
The cabinet in Bratislava stressed that no significant problems are anticipated, as Slovakia traditionally does not attract many immigrants.
The government said it wants to send a positive message of non-discrimination to Bulgaria and Romania, and to fellow EU member states.

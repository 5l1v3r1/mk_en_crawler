BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The government announced on Monday (April 20th) it has decided to maintain labour restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers.
It will lift the restrictions on eight new EU member states, but the newest -- Bulgaria and Romania -- are not among them, the government said.
The UK, Germany and Austria recently announced they too would maintain restrictions for Romania and Bulgaria, despite the European Commission's recommendation to ease labour conditions for workers from new member states.
Romanians and Bulgarians need permits to work in Ireland, while Denmark announced it is lifting restrictions for the citizens of the two states as of May 1st.

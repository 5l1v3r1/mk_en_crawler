SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The country will no longer need a high representative if it fulfils the agreements reached recently in Banja Luka and Prud between the leaders of three main Bosniak, Serb and Croat parties, says Doris Pack, the head of the European Parliament's (EP) Committee for Southeast Europe. 
Speaking on Thursday (January 29th), she said it is a good time for the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to be transformed into the office of EU Special Representative, if those agreements are actually implemented. 
If instead, they are agreements only on paper, it would mean BiH still needs an international overseer with Bonn powers, Pack added. 
The agreement struck in Banja Luka earlier this week addresses the last two conditions that must be met before the OHR can close -- resolving the status of Brcko District and that of state-level property.

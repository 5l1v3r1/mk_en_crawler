TIRANA, Albania -- The majority and the opposition Socialist Party (SP) finally found common language on judicial system reforms during a plenary session late Wednesday (December 26th), when they discussed five bills that have been pending for months and directly affect the judiciary.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha of the ruling Democratic Party hailed the SP's decision to co-operate and agreed to postpone the voting until January, as the SP requested.
In other news, parliament is to resume debate Thursday on whether to lift Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha's immunity from prosecution.
At issue are allegations of corruption that have surfaced involving the bidding process related to construction of the Durres-Kukes highway.
Basha was transport minister at the time.

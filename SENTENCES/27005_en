NOVI SAD, Serbia -- The trial against Serbian neo-Nazi leader Goran "the Fuhrer" Davidovic and eight other people -- over a 2007 attack on participants in an anti-Fascist rally -- has been postponed at the request of Davidovic's lawyers, a court in Novi Sad announced on Sunday (March 7th). 
The proceedings were supposed to start Monday. 
Davidovic and two others are charged with inciting national, ethnic and religious hatred. 
The rest are accused of violence against rally participants. 
Davidovic is being prosecuted in absentia. 
He is in Germany, pending extradition, after being arrested there last month.

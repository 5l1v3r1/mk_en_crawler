PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Four people were injured when a bomb went off in one of Pristina's upscale neighbourhoods on Sunday (January 20th).
A police spokesman said the blast occurred at about 7:30pm in the Dragodan district, where many western diplomats live.
There were also reports of gunfire in the area.
It coincided with Serbia's hotly contested presidential election and Kosovo's anticipated declaration of independence.

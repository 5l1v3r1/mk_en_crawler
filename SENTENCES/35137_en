BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen plans to present a report on Romania soon, according to Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana. 
The report was prepared in response to requests by the European Parliament (EP) for such a document, which would complement the EP regular report on Romania. 
That report urged the European Commission to shift its strategy and spend more time helping the government improve the rule of law. 
EU Rapporteur for Romania Emma Nicholson said Verheugen's document is in the spirit of those EP recommendations.

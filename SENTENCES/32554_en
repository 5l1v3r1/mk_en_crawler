BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The new parliament voted Friday (7 March) to elect Montenegro's Svetozar Marovic the first president of the new union. 
At his inaugural ceremony, he promised to improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and to work for Serbia-Montenegro's European future.
Acting Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic echoed that view Friday, saying the work of Serbia-Montenegro authorities over the next three years should be devoted exclusively to furthering the process of European integration and resolving economic and social issues.
While Marovic told top leaders and foreign diplomats that the problem of Kosovo must be resolved through negotiations and with help from the international community, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic told a local newspaper that he wants to see the province divided into Serb and ethnic Albanian entities, which would be given several years to decide whether they want to stay together. 
A UN spokesman in Pristina said the international community does not support territorial solutions to ethnic problems.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A helicopter crash killed two US peacekeepers early Sunday (8 June) in Kosovo, according to a statement from the main US camp in the province, Bondsteel. 
Officials are investigating the cause, though no foul play is suspected in the crash of the AH-64 Apache helicopter. 
UN and NATO-led peacekeepers have been in charge of Kosovo since June 1999. 
The international peacekeeping force of 25,000 soldiers includes about 2,500 US troops.
In other news, an explosion rocked downtown Pristina Saturday, not far from parliament. 
At least seven people were injured, two seriously. 
Witnesses say a hand grenade caused the blast.

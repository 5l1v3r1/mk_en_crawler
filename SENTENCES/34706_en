ZAGREB, Croatia -- The major opposition party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), says it is certain of victory in the fall elections and would form a new cabinet.
The party issued a press release on Monday (18 August), in response to media speculation that it would rather lose the elections and maintain its opposition status.
The latest polls show HDZ enjoys the strongest public support as a single party and has the best chance at winning the general elections.

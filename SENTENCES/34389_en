BELGRADE, Serbia and Montenegro -- Serbian officials reacted with caution and surprise to the UN war crimes tribunal's decision to indict four generals for war crimes in Kosovo. 
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic, whose government is facing a no-confidence motion in parliament, said Tuesday (21 October) that there would be no immediate arrests and extraditions. 
Justice Minister Vladan Batic described the new indictments as a "dictate, blackmail and ultimatum". 
UN court officials rejected these statements, reminding Serbia that it has an obligation to turn in war crimes suspects. 
The four generals are former Army Chief of Staff Nebojsa Pavkovic, former Pristina Corps Commander Vladimir Lazarevic, incumbent Chief of Public Security Sreten Lukic and his predecessor, Vlastimir Djordjevic.

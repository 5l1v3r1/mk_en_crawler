TIRANA, Albania -- The government has refused to meet a request that would enable the opposition to conduct an "unlimited" investigation into the June 2009 general elections.
Replying to a letter sent by Socialist Party (SP) leader Edi Rama about ten days ago, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Monday (November 1st) that "in a democratic system, no institution can have unlimited power or lead unlimited investigations." The opposition has accused the government of dragging out the process, insisting that there can be no transparent elections in the future without shedding light on the 2009 vote.
Local media suggested that Berisha's latest reaction is likely to trigger new street protests by the opposition.

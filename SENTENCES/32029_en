BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Leaders of Serbia's ruling Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) will meet next week to clarify whether the coalition is supporting Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's bid for the Serbian presidency.
The head of New Serbia, Velimir Ilic, will chair the presidency session.
He said Wednesday (20 November) that the session is needed in light of claims by some DOS parties that Kostunica does not have full support.
Ilic says the majority of the parties decided that the coalition as a whole would back Kostunica, as DOS has no candidate in the race.
Kostunica faces two opponents in the 8 December election:
Borislav Pelevic, chairman of the Serbian Unity Party, and the head of the Serbian Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj.

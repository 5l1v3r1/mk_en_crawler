SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) decided on Tuesday (February 26th) to expel member Nikolay Kamov from its parliamentary group, the Coalition for Bulgaria. 
He is the leader of the Social Democrats, an ally of the BSP. 
Citing dissatisfaction with the government's efforts against corruption, Kamov voted against the cabinet during a no-confidence motion last week.

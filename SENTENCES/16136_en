ANKARA, Turkey -- Former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit finally regained consciousness on Friday (11 August) after having been in coma for almost three months.
Doctors at the hospital in Ankara where he is being treated say Ecevit communicated with his wife by holding her hand and is able to breathe without a respirator.
He is unable to talk or eat.
Ecevit, 81, was admitted to hospital and underwent emergency surgery after suffering a stroke on 18 May.
Doctors decided to keep him in a coma to prevent further swelling in his brain.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The government released more information Monday (21 April) on the assassination of the late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, indicating that a group of 12 people carried out the killing with logistical support from six others, including police and secret service agents.
Officials said Milorad Lukovic, the head of the Zemun mafia clan, commanded the operation from Belgrade.
They added that two secret service agents, Branislav Bezarevic and Toni Gavric, were at the government building shortly before the shooting, monitoring the prime minister's movements.
Several other teams were allegedly deployed in the area to provide logistical support to the killers.
Some of the conspirators, including Zvezdan Jovanovic -- the man admitted to pulling the trigger -- came from the police special operations unit which Lukovic commanded during Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
According to the government, evidence suggests there were four unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Djindjic prior to the fatal shooting on 12 March.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) plans to propose to its two coalition partners an update of the government's social and economic policies. 
BSP leader and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Tuesday (April 10th) that boosting incomes and standards of living -- as well as economic competitiveness -- would be priorities for the remaining two years of the ruling coalition's mandate. 
Recent polls suggest the coalition's public approval ratings are slipping.

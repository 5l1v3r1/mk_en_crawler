BELGRADE, Serbia -- A court in Belgrade has rejected a request by relatives of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to declare him dead, court spokesperson Gordana Vukovic said on Wednesday (September 8th).
Mladic's family decided on the procedure for two reasons -- they want access to his frozen assets and pensions and they want to end all "pressure" exerted on them.
By law, the procedure can be initiated if the subject is older than 70 and there has been no reliable data on him for more than five years.
Mladic, 68, disappeared shortly after The Hague war crimes tribunal charged him in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
His family claims he had been sick and not seen in public since 2003.

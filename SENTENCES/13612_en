SOFIA, Bulgaria -- In the wake of a controversy over remarks by EU Affairs Minister Meglena Kuneva, the ruling coalition voiced firm support Thursday (23 March) for the package of draft constitutional amendments being discussed by parliament.
Earlier this week, Kuneva had appeared to suggest the European Commission might propose activation of the safeguard clause -- delaying EU membership for a year -- over dissatisfaction with the current set of draft constitutional changes regarding judicial reform.
Following a meeting between Kuneva and the coalition parties' parliamentary caucuses, however, the "misunderstanding" has been resolved, said Mihail Mikov of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.
He added that some texts would be slightly edited.
In other news Thursday, Bulgarian Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev launched a special unit for organised crime, money laundering and corruption, which will operate under his direct supervision.
As promised, he filed charges against two alleged criminal bosses -- brothers Krasimir and Nikolay Marinov.
They were charged with conspiracy to murder, managing criminal organisations and illegal possession of firearms.

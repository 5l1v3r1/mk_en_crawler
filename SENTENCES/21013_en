MOSCOW, Russia -- Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday (September 3rd) that while Russia is no opponent of the United States, it will not bargain over Kosovo or a proposed US missile defence shield in Eastern Europe. 
Moscow has drawn a "red line" on both issues beyond which it will not cross, Lavrov told students at the Moscow State Institute for International Relations.
Commenting on those remarks, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said Serbia should not be granted favours or rewards when it comes to Kosovo. 
While it is legitimate for Belgrade to show an interest towards the Serb minority in Kosovo, it has no legal right to ask anything of Kosovo, Ceku said.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal might allow local Belgrade authorities to prosecute indictees charged with 1991 crimes in Vukovar, according to local news sources. 
Tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann said Thursday (22 May) that chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte handed over documents Monday pertaining to "low and middle level" Vukovar indictees. 
The status of former Yugoslav officers Miroslav Radic, Mile Mrksic and Veselin Sljivancanin would not change.
Meanwhile, Hartmann said two other indictees, former state security head Jovica Stanisic and his subordinate Franko Simatovic, would likely testify for the prosecution at Slobodan Milosevic's trial.

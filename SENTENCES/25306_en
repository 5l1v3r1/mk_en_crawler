TIRANA, Albania -- European Commission (EC) Director for the Western Balkans Pierre Mirel on Tuesday (November 24th) urged the opposition Socialist Party (SP) to stop its boycott and return to its seats in parliament. 
"There should be a way to bring the opposition back," Mirel said in Tirana, after meeting with Foreign Minister Ilir Meta. 
The SP says it will continue until the ruling majority agrees to allow an investigation into alleged "manipulations" in the June general elections.

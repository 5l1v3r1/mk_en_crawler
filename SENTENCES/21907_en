ATHENS, Greece -- Authorities in Rhodes declared a state of emergency Tuesday (July 22nd) on the southern areas of the island because of raging wildfires. 
Flames swept across thousands of hectares of forest, forcing the evacuation of the village of Moni Skiadi. 
The blaze also cut the water supply, electricity and telephone communications in the village of Agios Isidoros. 
Authorities say a fire that broke out Tuesday in Koutsoupias, Greece, now threatens the village of Kokkino Nero.

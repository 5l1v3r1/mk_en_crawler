PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia -- A prominent former military commander and two other men were shot dead in Pec on Saturday (4 January), a UN spokesman reported.
Tahir Zemaj was killed when attackers opened fire on his car early in the morning, eyewitnesses said.
Zemaj testified for the prosecution in a recent trial against five former Kosovo Liberation Army members, including the brother of one of the province's top politicians, and narrowly escaped an attempt on his life earlier last year.
The other two victims were identified as Zemaj's 20-year-old son, Enis, and a relative, Hasan Zemaj.
Police in Pec would not comment on the motives for the killings, pending an investigation.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan denied press allegations of conflicts between local authorities and the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In an interview with the Croatian press Monday (3 March), Racan said some circles in the country had attempted to fabricate news concerning the case.
He also rejected allegations of delayed deliveries of documents in connection with the arrest warrant for indicted Gen Ante Gotovina.
Several press sources claimed earlier that the UN tribunal was planning to push for more police investigations into the whereabouts of Gotovina.
Also Monday, UN investigators resumed questioning of Croatian retired Gen Mladen Markac in The Hague.
He controlled the interior ministry's special police forces until 2000.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The IMF's new country officer for Bulgaria said on Tuesday (9 September) that the government must do more to improve the general business climate, if it wants to attract foreign investors.
Delays in the sale of the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company and the Bulgartabac Holding Company resulted in a significant drop in foreign investment, James Roaf said.

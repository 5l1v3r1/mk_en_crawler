ATHENS, Greece -- Representatives of Bulgaria, Greece and Russia gathered in Athens on Thursday (March 15th) to formally seal an agreement on building the long-delayed Bourgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline. 
Construction of the 288km long facility is expected to begin next year and end in 2009. 
It is designed to carry some 35 millon tonnes of crude oil annually.
Security in Athens is tight, as the pipeline ceremony coincides with a rally by students to protest higher educational reforms proposed by the government. 
The bill passed the Parliament late Tuesday.

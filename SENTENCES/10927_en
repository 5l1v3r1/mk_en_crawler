SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Local elections in BiH took place Saturday (2 October) in a generally peaceful atmosphere and without serious incidents, according to the BiH Election Commission and government officials.
Turnout was low, with only 45 per cent of the country's 2.3m registered voters going to the polls to elect mayors and councillors in 140 municipalities.
Early results show the three main nationalist parties -- the Bosniak Party for Democratic Action, the Serb Democratic Party and the Croat Democratic Union -- in the lead.
However, the opposition Social Democrats are poised to win in the Republika Srpska capital, Banja Luka, and may gain control of as many as 10 municipalities in the Bosnian Serb entity.

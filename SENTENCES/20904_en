BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The enlargement of the EU towards the Western Balkans is crucial to ensuring strategic stability and to preventing future conflict, says a report by the European Commission set for release Tuesday (November 6th). 
Radio Free Europe quoted the report on Sunday, saying that countries in the Western Balkans can expect EU membership in the mid- and long-term. 
The report also says that Kosovo's status must be resolved for the good of regional political and economic development.
Regarding specific countries, in Bosnia and Herzegovina ethnic division continues to hamper the function of state institutions, democratic forces in Serbia remain fragile, and insufficient co-operation among political parties in Macedonia has slowed reforms. 
Albania has been hampered by its confrontational political climate, while Montenegro has struggled with a protracted process to approve a new constitution.

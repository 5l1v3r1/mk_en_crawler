ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) intends to hold talks with the opposition on possible constitutional amendments, Burhan Kuzu, the head of parliament's Joint Constitution-Justice Commission, told Reuters on Wednesday (April 8th). 
After the March 29th local elections, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would seek changes to the 1982 constitution, saying it is slowing the country's drive for modernisation and is hurting economic development. 
The AKP also says the constitution curbs political rights, including freedom of expression and religious freedom, and allows the military to influence the government. 
Kuzu says the AKP will initiate talks with members of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party, the Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Action Party.

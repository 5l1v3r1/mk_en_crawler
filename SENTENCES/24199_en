PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EU security chief Javier Solana travelled to Kosovo on Tuesday (July 14th), promising that the process of visa liberalisation will eventually include other Western Balkan countries, as they meet requirements. 
"When countries reach a capacity to have an authentic control of borders, when they will have the capacity to produce biometric passports, then they are on the list," he said. 
He praised the progress made since Kosovo declared its independence in February 2008 and promised that the EU will support the European Commission's decision to recommend a visa-free regime for the country soon.
Solana arrived in Pristina from Skopje, where he urged officials to continue implementing reforms related to EU membership. 
He stopped short however of mentioning a specific date for starting accession talks.

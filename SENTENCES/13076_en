BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- During a visit to Britain on Tuesday (27 September), Serbian President Boris Tadic said there could be no prospect for successful Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks between Serbia-Montenegro and the EU if the case of war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic is not resolved.
Tadic's comment followed talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.
In Belgrade, meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica met with Serbia-Montenegrin President Svetozar Marovic about appointing a new federal defence minister.
Earlier this week, it was announced that Serbia's ruling coalition has agreed to nominate the former head of the Belgrade military medical academy, Zoran Stankovic, to the post.
He would replace Prvoslav Davinic, who resigned amid a procurement scandal.

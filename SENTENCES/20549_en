BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU should maintain ties with Libya, Valentina Siropulo, one of the six Bulgarian medics jailed for eight years in Libya for allegedly infecting children with the HIV virus, said on Wednesday (October 10th).
She and the others were in Brussels, visiting the European Parliament.
She described relations between the EU and Libya as a matter of "finding the right tone, of striking a balance of pluses and minuses".
The medics were invited to ceremonies marking World Day against the Death Penalty.
Originally sentenced to death by Libyan courts, their sentences eventually were commuted to life in prison.
In time, all six were transferred to Bulgaria where they received presidential pardons.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Council of Ministers adopted a protocol Tuesday (29 July) amending the border agreement with Croatia on free border traffic through the port of Ploce.
The two countries had agreed earlier to adopt relevant amendments and to set up a joint commission responsible for interpretation and implementation of the accord.
In case of disputes within the panel, each side would appoint arbitrators.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown, meanwhile, is scheduled to makes a brief visit to Croatia to discuss regional co-operation.

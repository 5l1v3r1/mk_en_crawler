TIRANA, Albania -- European Commission President Romano Prodi arrived in Albania on Friday (31 January) for the start of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement that could eventually result in EU membership.
"We set very clear priorities:
political democratic work, electoral law, legislation for property and reform of the judiciary system in order to fight corruption and organized crime," he said at a press conference.
Prodi also promised his hosts that the EU would work with Albania to help it meet these conditions.
The first meeting between EU and Albanian experts is scheduled for 13 February.
President Alfred Moisiu, meanwhile, expressed hope that reforms would bring it closer to membership in NATO.
He said all political parties in Albania supported the country's NATO aspirations and that the government was committed to carrying out the plan of action for membership.(AP, AFP, ATA - 31/01/03)

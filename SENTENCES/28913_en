BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu on Tuesday (November 9th) asked for a political moratorium in order to spur parliament back into action.
Lawmakers must approve the pension, single wage and budget laws within 30-45 days, as they are preconditions for continuation of the country's IMF arrangement, and are crucial to the economy, Basescu told parliament.
Passage has been delayed for weeks due to the stalemate in the Deputies Chamber, where the opposition accused chamber president Roberta Anastase of forgery nearly two months ago.
Since then, lawmakers from the opposition Social Democratic Party and National Liberal Party have refused to participate in debates, seeking Anastase's resignation.
Nor could the ruling coalition ensure the necessary quorum in the chamber.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- After two years in hiding, retired Gen Ante Gotovina now says he will talk to UN investigators and surrender if he cannot persuade them of his innocence. 
Gotovina, indicted for atrocities against Serb civilians in a 1995 Croatian Amy offensive, made the offer during an interview conducted at a secret location with Ivo Pukanic, editor of the <I>Nacional</I> weekly. 
It was published Tuesday (10 June). 
Pukanic was later questioned by police.

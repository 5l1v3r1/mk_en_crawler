ANKARA, Turkey -- Excavators unearthed fragments of bones on Monday (March 9th) in oil wells in southeast Turkey while searching for the bodies of Kurds allegedly murdered in the 1990s, media reported. 
The bones, found near a military facility in the district of Silopi, will undergo forensic analysis. 
Last month, prosecutors ordered inspection of the wells amid allegations that Turkish security forces dumped the bodies of Kurds whom they had executed into acid-filled wells. 
The wells belong to Botas, the state-owned oil company.

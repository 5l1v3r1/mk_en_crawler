VIENNA, Austria -- During a speech Monday (April 21st), High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Miroslav Lajcak stressed that meeting the conditions for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) does not end BiH's commitments to the EU. 
He said politicians should focus next on meeting the criteria required to close down the Office of the High Representative (OHR) once and for all. 
In his remarks in Vienna to a conference on BiH's European prospects, Lajcak noted that the Peace Implementation Council had identified five main issues to confront soon in order for the OHR to close -- apportionment of state property, resolution of defence property, completion of the Brcko Final Award, fiscal sustainability and entrenchment of the rule of law.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Federation of BiH (FBiH) House of Peoples adopted a new entity law on public broadcasting Tuesday (4 April), but without the consent of the Croat caucus, which intends to activate a procedure against it.
Amendments the Croat MPs had proposed were rejected, including one to launch TV programmes in all three constituent nations' languages on state TV.
The FBiH Parliament is expected to form a joint committee, involving representatives from both houses, to hammer out a deal on the matter.
The Office of the High Representative recently urged the FBiH legislature to adopt a new entity public broadcasting law in line with EU criteria, but warned that some provisions in this draft fell short of international standards.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic says Serbia will neither give up defending Kosovo nor its European future.
He told B92 in an interview Tuesday (February 26th) that his Democratic Party (DS) would remain in the government if it continues to work on all five priorities the DS, the Serbian Democratic Party-New Serbia and G17 Plus agreed upon when the ruling coalition was formed.
These priorities are defence of Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, European integration, co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, and fighting crime and corruption while improving living standards.
Djelic said another goal is to completely liberalise the EU's visa regime for Serbia by the end of this year.
Also Tuesday, Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic of the G17 Plus said Serbia should stop servicing Kosovo's external debt.
He insisted the move would not imply recognition of Kosovo's independence, and said the money would be better spent assisting Serbs in Kosovo.

TIRANA, Albania -- Finance Minister Arben Malaj met with the visiting World Bank delegation on Thursday (12 February) to discuss the Bank's financing strategy for domestic projects.
Malaj expressed the government's desire to preserve terms under which it had been drawing loans from the Bank.
He also urged officials to reconsider Bank credit plans, in order to meet the targets of Albania's National Strategy for Economic and Social Development.

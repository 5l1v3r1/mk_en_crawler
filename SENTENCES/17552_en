BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian President Boris Tadic has begun a series of meetings with the country's top political leaders on forming a new cabinet. 
He met on Monday (January 29th) with representatives of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which won the most votes in the January 21st elections. 
The Radicals reportedly asked for a mandate to form a cabinet but did not name a candidate for prime minister. 
Tadic then held consultations with his own Democratic Party (DS), which came in second in the vote. 
Its nominee for prime minister is former Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic.
Tadic continued the consultations on Tuesday, meeting with representatives of the Democratic Party of Serbia-New Serbia coalition and G17 Plus.

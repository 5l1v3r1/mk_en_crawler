SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- At a press conference Monday (November 5th), High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said he is optimistic that legal teams representing his office and and Republika Srpska's (RS) government will resolve a dispute over measures Lajcak announced recently to boost decision-making by parliament and the central government. 
Although no agreement was reached Monday, the teams agreed to continue negotiations throughout the week. 
According to local newspapers, RS experts are drafting a proposal to amend laws on the Council of Ministers (CoM) and the BiH parliament that would guarantee that the opinions of each of the three constituent peoples would be considered in future voting. 
CoM Chairman Nikola Spiric resigned last week to protest the measures, while RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik says Serbs should boycott state institutions.

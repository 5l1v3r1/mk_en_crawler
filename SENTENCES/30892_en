PRISTINA, Kosovo -- EULEX prosecutors have pressed charges against two former commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) for war crimes committed in 1999, media reported on Saturday (January 8th).
Sabit Geci and Riza Alija are accused of torture and other crimes against Kosovo Albanian civilians who were detained at two camps in northern Albania.
The KLA allegedly detained the civilians for collaborating with Serbian authorities or harbouring political views that were different from those of the KLA.
EULEX arrested Geci and Alija in May and June 2010, respectively.

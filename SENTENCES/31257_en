BUCHAREST, Romania -- A presidential adviser quit her post Friday (December 31st) after it surfaced that she had a deal with the communist-era secret service agency Securitate. 
Alexandra Gatej, 45, business adviser to President Traian Basescu, performed industrial espionage for the service under the pseudonym Florina, CSNAS, the agency in charge of processing the Securitate files, announced. 
But the CSNAS said it could not confirm Gatej's role as an informant since no files provided by her have been found. 
Still, Gatej said she was stepping down due to the "unjustified" attacks against her and her family.

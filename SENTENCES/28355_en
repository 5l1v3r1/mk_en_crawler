ANKARA, Turkey -- A memorandum of understanding on the Turkey-Greece-Italy Natural Gas Pipeline was signed in Ankara on Thursday (June 17th). 
Under the agreement, Turkey's Petroleum Pipeline Corporation (BOTAS), Italy's EDISON and Greece's DEPA will build an 804km-long facility that will carry natural gas from the Caspian region to Europe. 
The pipeline starts in Azerbaijan and ends in Italy.
In addition Thursday, Turkey signed a preliminary document to renew its crude oil export agreement with Iraq for 12 more years. 
Crude oil export via Turkey's southeastern Ceyhan port accounts for almost one-third of Iraq's total crude oil exports. 
The oil from the fields around Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, is one of Turkey's most significant energy supply sources. 
Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asem Jihad says the final agreement will be signed during Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz's upcoming visit to Baghdad.

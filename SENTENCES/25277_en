SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The social and economic council, working on the cabinet's anti-crisis plan, reached consensus Saturday (March 27th) on several tax hikes that would boost budget revenues by about 115m euros. 
The assorted measures still fall short of raising as much revenue a proposed 2% hike in the Value Added Tax. 
The goal of the anti-crisis package is to boost revenues and cut spending for a net effect of about 750m euros. 
Final negotiations are expected on Monday, which would allow parliament to vote on the proposals Wednesday.

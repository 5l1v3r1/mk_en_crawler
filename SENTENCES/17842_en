BUCHAREST, Romania -- The country's senior ruling coalition partners, the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party (PD), have indicated a willingness to reconcile after separate meetings by leaders Monday (January 22nd).
Longstanding differences between the PNL and PD boiled over last week, with President Traian Basescu of the PD and Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu of the PNL angrily accusing each other of corruption.
But according to statements made after the meetings, both parties agree that the only benefit of a split would be the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD).
As a result, they have made a decision to try and preserve the ruling coalition.

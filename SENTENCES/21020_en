BELGRADE, Serbia -- Parliament adopted new laws Monday (December 3rd) regarding the president and elections for president.
The laws contain no major changes as far as the duties of the president are concerned, but do lengthen the mandate from four to five years and alter procedures for dismissal.
After passing the measures, parliament immediately started a new session.
On the agenda are four other laws that must be adopted before presidential elections can be called.

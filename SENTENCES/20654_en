BELGRADE, Serbia -- The government reacted sharply on Wednesday (August 8th) to Albanian President Bamir Topi's support for Kosovo's independence, which he voiced after meeting Monday with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu.
On Thursday, Albanian media published part of the written reaction sent by the Serbian government.
It describes Topi's position as "totally unacceptable" and says "such statements were the reason for the low level of relations between the two countries".

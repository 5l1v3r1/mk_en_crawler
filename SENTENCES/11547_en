SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Bulgarian government endorsed a bilateral agreement with Albania on Thursday (21 July) calling for co-operation in the fight against transnational terrorism.
The two countries' defence ministers sealed the document in May.
The agreement envisions more military collaboration, active participation in international activities against terrorism and other threats, as well as joint steps aimed at boosting regional security and stability.
Also Thursday, the Bulgarian cabinet approved a draft accord with Germany, strengthening civilian air transport security.
One measure calls for a police presence on flights between the two countries.

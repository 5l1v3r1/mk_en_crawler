PRISTINA, Kosovo -- British Ambassador to Kosovo Andrew Sparks says he expects no conflict between UNMIK and the EU justice and police mission (EULEX) after Kosovo's constitution goes into force on June 15th.
"It is clear that the transfer from UNMIK to EULEX will be finalised according to the plan drafted by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari," Sparks said after presenting his credentials to Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu on Monday (April 28th).
Kosovo Serbs refuse to acknowledge EULEX and insist they will respect UNMIK only.
Also on Monday, the British government announced it will send a 600-member light infantry contingent into troubled northern Kosovo, following a request to all members from NATO.
In other news Monday, a team of UN investigators arrived in Kosovo to investigate UNMIK's command and operations in connection with violence in the northern town of Mitrovica on March 17th.
Clashes erupted after UNMIK police intervened to remove several Serbs who occupied the UN courthouse there.

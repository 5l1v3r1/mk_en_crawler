BUCHAREST, Romania -- The government has adopted a Pre-accession Economic Programme (PEP) for 2004-2006 and forwarded it to the European Commission, according to an announcement issued at the end of last week. 
The PEP represents compliance with EU economic accession criteria. 
Specifically, it outlines main budget targets and economic forecasts for the coming three-year period. 
The country's GDP is expected to increase, while the annual inflation rate is expected to fall from the present double-digit rate to 4 per cent.

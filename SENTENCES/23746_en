SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not attend an energy forum in Sofia this week, Moscow announced on Tuesday (April 21st). 
His replacement will be Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko. 
Putin was the only senior government official expected to attend. 
Some speculate that Russia will use the event to promote its interests in Southeast Europe's energy sector. 
The presence of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso is expected to steer discussion back to EU policies.

VUKOVAR, Croatia -- The head of the Vukovar county prosecution, Bozidar Piljic, confirmed on Saturday (13 May) that charges have been filed against a total of 52 people suspected of having committed war crimes against civilians in the area in 1991-1992. 
He did not provide details. 
According to local media, however, the indictees are Serbs suspected of crimes against Croatian civilians in Berk and Sotin.
Separately, Branimir Glavas, the parliament member whose immunity was lifted last week to enable his prosecution for alleged war crimes, tells police that he has received threats on his mobile phone. 
Prosecutors accuse him of crimes against ethnic Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991.

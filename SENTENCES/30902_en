ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Wednesday (March 9th) that the date for the upcoming parliamentary elections will be set after accession talks with the EU are completed.
She accused the main opposition Social Democratic Party of hampering progress in negotiations with the bloc.
The government hopes to complete accession talks with the EU by June.
But public protests have intensified the last couple of weeks over unemployment and the economy.

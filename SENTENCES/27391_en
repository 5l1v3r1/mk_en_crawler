BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) warned France on Wednesday (September 29th) that it would face infringement proceedings unless it abides by EU rules on the freedom of movement within two weeks.
The warning came in a two-page document issued after the commissioners held a lengthy closed-door meeting about France's controversial expulsion of Roma to their homes in Bulgaria and Romania.
"France has not yet transposed the directive on free movement into national legislation that makes these rights fully effective and transparent," the statement said.
Paris has until October 15th to respond.

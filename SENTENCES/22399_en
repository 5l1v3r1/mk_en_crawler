NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Turkish Cypriots voiced displeasure over a co-operation agreement signed between Cyprus and Great Britain last week, saying the move could threaten fragile efforts to resume reunification talks. 
Hasan Ercakica, spokesman for Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, issued a statement Tuesday (June 10th) saying the agreement implied Greek Cypriot control over the breakaway Turkish Cypriot community. 
The accord, signed in London by Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on June 5th, stipulates the strengthening of co-operation and joint efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem. 
Talat and Christofias agreed in March to resume talks aimed at reuniting the island, divided now for decades. 
They appointed task forces to lay the groundwork for formal talks, expected to begin later this month.

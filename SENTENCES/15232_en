TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition says it will boycott parliament sessions as well as the next local elections unless the ruling coalition agrees to elect an opposition representative to the Central Election Commission (CEC) and the national council on radio and television.
The leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, Edi Rama, issued the warning Saturday (29 July), after Friday's legislative session ended in a melee that resulted in property damage.
The incident occurred after the DP-led majority elected its own representative to the CEC instead of an opposition one.
Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli accused the opposition of provoking the fight and said she would seek compensation for damage to the building.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greek Ambassador to the United States Alexandros Mallias conveyed to US President George W. 
Bush Athens' discontent with Washington's refusal to abolish visa requirements for Greeks travelling to the United States, media reported on Sunday (October 19th). 
Earlier in October, Washington decided to exclude Greece from its Visa Waiver Program (VWP), citing "political reasons". 
Greek government sources perceived a linkage to Athens' veto earlier this year of Macedonia's bid to join NATO over the countries' name dispute. 
Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said "Greece has a little bit of more work to do ... 
We think they're on track ... 
and will be able to be admitted [into the VWP] later in the year."
Meanwhile Friday, the European Commission (EC) said it is ready to take punitive measures against the United States if Washington fails to meets its commitment to include other EU nations in the VWP before the end of the year. 
EC spokesman Michele Cercone complained US citizens can travel freely in Europe while Europeans need visas to enter the United States.

CHICAGO, United States -- A federal judge on Monday (18 August) sentenced the head of an Islamic charity with subsidiaries in the United States and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to 11 years and four months in prison.
Enaam Arnaout, 41, a Syrian-born US citizen, was found guilty of diverting donations, originally intended for refugees, to fund Islamist fighters in BiH and Chechnya.
He would have to serve nearly ten years of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole.
The judge rejected a prosecution request for a 20-year sentence, agreeing that while Arnaout's ties to Osama bin Laden were suspicious, there was no evidence he actually engaged in terrorism.
Raids on his charity's offices in BiH produced most of the evidence against Arnaout.

BRDO PRI KRANJU, Slovenia -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged the EU on Saturday (March 29th) not to ignore developments in BiH, as Kosovo and Serbia grab headlines. 
"The Western Balkans are our back yard and this is the area where the EU is supposed to play a key role. 
With all the attention on Serbia and Kosovo, BiH must not become a secondary issue," Lajcak said in a speech to EU foreign ministers meeting in Slovenia. 
He said Bosnian Muslims are concerned by concessions the EU is ready to provide to Serbia, without forcing Belgrade to first arrest Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic.

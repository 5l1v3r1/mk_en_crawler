THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal announced on Friday (March 7th) it is postponing the trial against two former Serb security force officials by a week, following a request by the prosecution.
The trial against Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic will now begin on March 17th.
They are charged with the murder of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia during the 1992-1995 conflict.
Stanisic headed the Serbian Secret Service between 1991 and 1998 during the Milosevic regime, while Simatovic was commander of the Special Operations Unit of the service.
Prosecutors say the pair trained and armed Serb special units that participated in an ethnic cleansing campaign.

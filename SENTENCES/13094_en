BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic admitted on Monday (30 January) that he has met with members of Ratko Mladic's family.
Stankovic said the meeting took place at the end of December but insisted that it was not part of any negotiations on the fugitive's surrender.
He added that the army no longer protects Mladic.
On Tuesday, the Military Intelligence Agency is due to present a report listing the names of officers believed to have been in contact with Mladic and other top indictees since 2002.
In other news, the Belgrade District Court on Monday sentenced former Serb paramilitary member Milan Bulic to eight years in prison for war crimes.
Bulic, a former member of the Vukovar Territorial Defence unit, was convicted of inhumane behaviour towards Croatian prisoners at the Ovcara farm in 1991.

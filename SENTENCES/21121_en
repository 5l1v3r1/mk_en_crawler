BUCHAREST, Romania -- Ukraine's international image has been damaged by an anti-Romanian demonstration staged there, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said Sunday (September 2nd). 
"I am deeply sorry Ukraine is using such formulas which can only harm our relations. 
I believe that Ukraine needs to [be] open to Europe and Romania, just like Romania needs normal relations with its neighbours," Tariceanu told a local radio station.
On August 30th, more than 4,000 people gathered in front of the Romanian Embassy in Kiev, protesting Romanian territorial claims on an island located off the coasts of both countries. 
The dispute has been brought before the International Court of Justice.

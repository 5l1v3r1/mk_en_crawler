SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski told Alsat-M TV on Thursday (December 27th) that if asked to make "an ultimate choice" between NATO membership and his country's constitutional name, the name would win.
Crvenkovski made the comment in response to recent threats by Greece to block Macedonia's entry into NATO if the longstanding name dispute between the two countries was not resolved.
According to Crvenkovski, such a move would be a blatant breach of a 1995 interim treaty.
The president also acknowledged the international community is pressing both governments to find a solution.

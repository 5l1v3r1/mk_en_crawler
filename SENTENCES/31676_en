ATHENS, Greece -- Parliament on Monday (13 January) ratified a co-operation programme between Greek and US police. 
The project covers joint activities in training personnel, exchanging information and organising police exercises with the participation of experts from both sides. 
Co-operation will be carried out only in areas that will not jeopardise the national security of either country and confidentiality will be maintained where necessary. 
Greek police officials predicted their US counterparts would be very helpful in maintaining security during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

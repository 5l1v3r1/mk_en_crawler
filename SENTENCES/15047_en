TIRANA, Albania -- The tenth round of Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations between Albania and the EU was completed in Tirana Friday (30 September).
EC Director for Western Balkans Reinhard Priebe, who headed the EU side, told reporters after the two-day talks that a decision on sealing the SAA could come after 9 November, when the EC's next progress report on Albania is due to be released.
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is expected to visit Tirana on that date.
Priebe welcomed the new Albanian government's reform programme as ambitious and far-reaching, but stressed that the EU expects the pledged measures to be implemented.

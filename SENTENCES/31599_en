ATHENS, Greece -- Preparations for the 2004 Summer Olympics hit another snag Tuesday (15 April) when a court ordered construction halted on one of five media villages, which will accommodate 20,000 journalists.
The Council of State ruled that the law used to zone the land was unconstitutional.
A recent International Olympic Committee inspection acknowledged progress has been made lately but warned that there was no time left for further delays.

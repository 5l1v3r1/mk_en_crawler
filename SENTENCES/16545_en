SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski commented on Monday (October 9th) that his country would prefer that the solution to the Kosovo status be the result of compromise between Belgrade and Pristina.
Speaking to Stefan Lehne, EU special envoy for Kosovo, Crvenkovski stressed the solution should be mediated by international community but "mutually acceptable" to both sides.
Crvenkovski and Lehne also agreed the border demarcation between Kosovo and Macedonia should be completed within the process of defining the final status.
In other news Monday, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki met with Crvenkovski to discuss the government's request for the withdrawal of Macedonian Ambassador to the United States Ljupco Jordanovski.
The cabinet has insisted that he and the country's ambassador to London, Gjorgji Spasov, be recalled due to public bickering between them.
Spasov co-operated, but Jordanovski refuses to do so.

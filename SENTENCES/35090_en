ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday (29 April) that Cyprus is no longer an issue in efforts to join the EU, given the reunification referenda on the island last weekend. 
Turkey hopes to learn in December whether accession negotiations will begin next year.
Also Thursday, French President Jacques Chirac said he believes Turkey has a place in the Union but said accession negotiations would take at least ten years. 
Noting Ankara's significant efforts to bring its legislation in line with EU standards, Chirac said the challenge now is to make these laws work.

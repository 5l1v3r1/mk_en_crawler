SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Hundreds of students and professors staged a protest on Tuesday (May 11th) outside the country's biggest university over cuts in education subsidies.
The protestors warned that education would "die" if there are further cuts, and insist education should be a government priority.
Last week, the cabinet decided to trim all government spending by 20%s to lower the budget deficit.
Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said everyone must "tighten their belts" amid the crisis.

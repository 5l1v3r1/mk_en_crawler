SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The agriculture ministry announced on Thursday (April 1st) that a dead bird found near the city of Varna on the Black Sea coast has tested positive for the H5N1 virus.
This is the first and only case of bird flu registered in the country recently, but the ministry warned farmers to be on the alert amid bird migration.
Two weeks ago, a bird flu outbreak was confirmed in a village in neighbouring Romania, the first case in the EU in a year.

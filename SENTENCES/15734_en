PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Newly-appointed UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker has explicitly dismissed the idea of partitioning Kosovo, telling the Serbian news agency Beta that northern Kosovo is an integral part of the province and would remain such, regardless of the outcome of status talks.
He also said Kosovo has reached a new level of maturity that excludes any repetition of the March 2004 ethnic riots and violence.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Police announced on Tuesday (December19th) that they have smashed a network that was trafficking people to Western Europe.
Ten suspects were arrested for sheltering and transporting ten Albanians to the West, via Kosovo.
The arrests came as local police announced a redoubling of efforts to fight such trafficking.
In Croatia, meanwhile, police prevented 28 Albanian nationals, including 12 children, from illegally crossing the border into Slovenia.
Officials say they went from Albania to Serbia to Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia over the course of nearly three weeks.

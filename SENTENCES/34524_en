ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Monday (6 October) that it has finalised work on a new development bill aimed at stimulating major domestic and foreign investments. 
The bill is to be sent to parliament within a week and will take effect as of 1 January. 
It envisions capital incentives for companies that have been in business for at least five years, incentives for personnel recruitment and investments in high technology products, as well as perks for companies that operate in underdeveloped regions. 
The law would also lower the corporate tax bracket for companies investing more than 30m euros.

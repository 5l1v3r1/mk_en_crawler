SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- EU security chief Javier Solana says the EU will not allow anyone or anything to jeopardise the fragile security in BiH, and that the Union remains determined to bring stabilisation efforts to a successful end.
His remarks appear in an interview published in Monday's (February 26th) edition of Dnevni avaz, to coincide with the start of the Peace Implementation Council's (PIC) session in Brussels on the future of the Office of the High Representative in BiH.
Solana says any future downsizing of EUFOR troops should be viewed as recognition of the progress achieved by BiH in strengthening its own security structures.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivica Racan met with a delegation from Transparency International Croatia on Friday (19 September).
At issue were the results of a survey about corruption and information availability in the country.
The survey, conducted in May by an international network of associations for preventing corruption, showed that the population expects more stringent penalties for violators of the law and more efforts to combat corruption.
Josip Kregar, a delegation member, acknowledged that the situation is improving.
International corruption indices show improvement since 2000.

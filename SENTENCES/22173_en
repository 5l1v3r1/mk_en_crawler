BUCHAREST, Romania -- Career diplomat Lazar Comanescu, head of the Romanian mission to the EU, was tapped to serve as foreign minister Monday (April 14th), succeeding Adrian Cioroianu in the post. 
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu proposed Comanescu, and President Traian Basescu approved the nomination. 
Comanescu has been with the foreign ministry since 1972 and has a no-nonsense reputation. 
He prefers to promote career diplomats to posts rather than political appointees. 
Cioroianu resigned late last week, taking political responsibility for the death of a Romanian citizen in a Polish prison.

ATHENS, Greece/LISBON, Portugal -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said Saturday (September 1st) that the EU will help Greece overcome the damage caused by fires that have ravaged the country.
"We will review Greece's request for help immediately after the assessment of the damages is completed," Barroso said after meeting with Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis.
Currently, the losses have been estimated at more than 1.1 billion euros.
The fires, which began on August 24th, took at least 63 lives and destroyed 200,000 hectares of land.
Some of the blazes were rekindled by strong winds at the weekend, causing five firefighters and 17 civilians to be evacuated by helicopter.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg addressed the nation on Tuesday (24 December), delivering holiday greetings and a brief report on the government's performance.
He described the work of the cabinet as very successful, citing the recent drop in unemployment to a three-year low amid increased wages and compensation.
He added that this economic and political progress had gained international recognition with the invitation for NATO membership and a firm commitment by the EU to welcome Bulgaria as a fully integrated member in 2007.

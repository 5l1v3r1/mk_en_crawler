THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN tribunal on Thursday (July 5th) rejected a motion by prosecutors to move the trial of former Bosnian Muslim army commander Rasim Delic to Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte had argued that he should be tried in his own country following an amendment to his indictment. 
Delic is charged with war crimes committed by foreign Islamic fighters under his command, particularly, the murder of 24 Bosnian Croats near Maline in June 1993. 
As he would not be tried for crimes actually committed by him, it was no longer appropriate for the UN tribunal to hear the case, del Ponte argued. 
The judges disagreed, saying justice would not be served if the trial was suspended at this point. 
Hearings are to begin on Monday.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- At a news conference Sunday (October 21st), Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac ruled out deploying troops in Kosovo if the province unilaterally declares independence.
Sutanovac, a leading member of the reformist Democratic Party, said any incursion would lead to a confrontation with KFOR.
He added that Serbian authorities and the international peacekeepers are working together to ensure the security of people in the province.
Other Serbian officials, however, voiced sharp criticism of the peacekeeping effort.
On Saturday, a spokesman for Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia accused NATO of trying to establish a satellite state on Serbian territory.

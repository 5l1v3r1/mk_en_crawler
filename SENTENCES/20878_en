BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Anti-corruption Department (DNA) announced on Wednesday (December 5th) the names of four prosecutors, a judge and a notary that are being investigated for suspected corruption.
Dimitru Gheorghe, Sterian Guli, Gheorghe Cerbeanu, Gheorghe Bucur, Cojocaru Eugen and Gabriela Ghita are suspected of rigging a contest held to assign the heads of the prosecution offices in Bucharest and in the city of Pitesti.
Evidence suggests some of the candidates offered bribes to members of the examining commissions.

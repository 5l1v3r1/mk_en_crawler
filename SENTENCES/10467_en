ANKARA, Turkey -- The government will launch its new lira on 1 January, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday (16 September).
A promotional campaign is expected to start within days.
Turkey's current lira is causing problems as a result of inflation:
25,000 lira now buy just one US cent.
The new lira is expected to be worth around $0.65.
Both the new and old currencies will be used until 31 December 2005.
Also Thursday, the government withdrew its proposed new penal code while lawmakers were in the process of voting on the 345th clause.
The move fuelled speculation that the ruling party would attempt to reinstate a provision making adultery a criminal offence.
The opposition Republican Party, which opposes the provision, accused the government of trying to sidestep an agreement to drop it.
The EU has also lobbied against criminalising adultery, saying the measure would harm Turkey's bid to enter the Union.
That bid received support Thursday from Austrian Ambassador to Turkey Marius Calligaris.
He predicted the EU would in December give Ankara a date for starting accession negotiations.

NEW YORK, United States -- UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker submitted a regular report to the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday (October 9th) and urged Serbs living in Kosovo to vote in next month's elections.
He also said he has asked Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica not to call for a boycott of the November 17th vote.
As for the final status process, US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad insisted that any delay could be dangerous and destabilising.
But Russian counterpart Vitaly Churkin warned that a rushed unilateral decision would create more problems than continuing negotiations beyond the current December 10th deadline.
During a visit to Gjilan on Tuesday, KFOR Commander General Xavier Bout de Marnhac said it could be mid-January before Kosovo's final status is determined.

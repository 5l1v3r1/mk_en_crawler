PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- The commander of KFOR, French Lieutenant General Yves de Kermabon, said Wednesday (22 December) that discussions about Kosovo's final status could begin in mid-2005. 
He told the Pristina-based news agency KosovaLive that this could happen if the provincial institutions intensify efforts to meet the standards outlined by the international community. 
He added that recent developments -- including peaceful elections and political agreement regarding the new cabinet -- suggest that current challenges could be overcome.

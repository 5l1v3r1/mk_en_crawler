THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The war crimes trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will not start before September, tribunal Judge Ian Bonomy said on Wednesday (July 1st).
Karadzic, however, rejected and said the date is too soon because reviewing materials related to the case would take "several months".
The judge expressed concern regarding deadlines and said he expects prosecutors will need more than a year to present their case.
"We will probably have to consider other ways to approach this case," Bonomy told the prosecutors.
Karadzic, 64, was arrested in Belgrade in July 2008 after spending 13 years on the run.
He is charged with 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal will judge Serbia's co-operation by its results rather than its promises, a spokesman said on Thursday (13 July).
Anton Nikiforov, a spokesman for chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, was responding to a reporter's question about Belgrade's new action plan to arrest indictee Ratko Mladic.
Nikiforov added that prosecutors are unaware of any changes in the EU position regarding Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with Serbia, which were suspended in May over Serbia's failure to apprehend Mladic.
Media reports Thursday suggested the European Commission might decide to unblock the SAA negotiations in September, if the government's action plan for co-operation proves convincing.
In other news, the UN tribunal has allowed Bosnian Serb defendant Dragan Zelenovic more time to consider his plea because he has been unable to consult his lawyer.
Zelenovic, a former policeman, is charged with the rape and torture of Muslim teenagers in Foca.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson sent a letter to the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) this week, urging them to set up a joint command and control centre for the two entities' armed forces.
He called on the newly elected members of the BiH presidency to form a strong central defence ministry and general staff, reminding them that this was a condition for admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Robertson cited the Orao scandal as an example of the weak control currently being exercised.
His remarks were echoed by Paddy Ashdown, the top international officer in Sarajevo.
On Wednesday (13 November), Ashdown warned local leaders that NATO's patience is running out.

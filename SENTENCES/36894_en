THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The judges in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic said Tuesday (6 July) that the defendant is well enough for the proceedings to continue.
They warned, however, that his health might prevent Milosevic from continuing to defend himself.
The trial is set to resume on 14 July.
The judges also said that they might consider appointing a lawyer to assist Milosevic and take over his defence if needed, an idea he has vehemently opposed.

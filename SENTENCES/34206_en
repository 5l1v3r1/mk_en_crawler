SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The finance ministry said Tuesday (8 July) that the IMF's Board of Executive Directors has completed the latest review of Bulgaria, the third to be held under the Fund's two-year stand-by agreement with the country.
It opens the way for the Bulgarian government to draw $36.5m in funds, representing the 6th IMF tranche for Bulgaria.
The Board attributed the positive evaluation to the economy's stable performance, improved debt ratios and large foreign currency reserves.

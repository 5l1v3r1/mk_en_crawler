BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) has obtained the support of other parliamentary parties for the formation of a new cabinet, SNSD leader Milorad Dodik said in an interview published Sunday (29 January) by Nezavisne novine. 
On Friday, the previous Serb Democratic Party (SDS)-led government fell after losing a no-confidence vote initiated by the SNSD. 
RS President Dragan Cavic, who also heads the SDS, has said he will fulfil his constitutional duty and give the mandate for forming a cabinet to any party that presents signatures of support from 42 MPs.

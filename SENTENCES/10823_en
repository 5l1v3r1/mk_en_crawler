SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The United States has formally recognised the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the "Republic of Macedonia", President Branko Crvenkovski announced Thursday (4 November). 
"Today is a great day for Macedonia and all Macedonians wherever they are," he said. 
State Department spokesman Tom Casey confirmed the decision and said it was made "without prejudice" regarding the UN-mediated talks on the name issue between Skopje and Athens. 
He added that the move -- which came just days before a weekend referendum on Macedonia's new decentralisation laws -- signaled Washington's support for the Macedonian government's commitment to implementing the Ohrid Peace Accords.

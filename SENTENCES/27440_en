PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The EU Rule of Law mission on Tuesday (September 28th) raided the home of Skenderaj/Srbica Mayor Sami Lushtaku for suspected abuse of office.
EULEX also searched the municipal administration offices and private premises of eight other officials suspected of abuse of office, fraud and influence peddling.
The raids mark the beginning of investigations by the Special Prosecutor's Office into fraudulent allocation of housing, EULEX explained in a press release.
Lushtaku denied all accusations and criticised the EU mission disturbing his family.
He was in Pristina while the search was conducted.
Lushtaku, a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, is an influential member of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo and one of his closest allies.
Two years ago, he was sentenced to four months in prison for threatening a judge.

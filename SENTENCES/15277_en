NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Greek Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pasiardis said at the weekend that the two ethnic communities on the island would be exchanging proposals for topics to be discussed by technical committees.
Earlier this month, President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed to resume stalled talks on reunification.
UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari said at that time that discussions on technical issues, aimed at improving everyday life, could be expected within weeks.

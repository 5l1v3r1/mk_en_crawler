ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Thursday (10 June) that the Istanbul Strait will be closed to traffic on 28 June and 29 June, the dates of the NATO summit in Istanbul. 
The local press, however, reported that navigation will be restricted but not altogether prohibited, as full closure would be in breach of the Montreux Treaty. 
Passenger vessels will be allowed through, while oil and gas tankers and other vessels carrying flammable materials will not. 
During the summit, there will be 24-hour aerial surveillance of the region, and 30,000 security personnel will be deployed in Istanbul.

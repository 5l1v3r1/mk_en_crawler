BUCHAREST, Romania -- The foreign ministry is evacuating its citizens from Georgia because of the "security deterioration in the country". 
Late Monday (August 11th), ministry spokesman Cosmin Boiangiu told journalists "the first aircraft departed for Armenia". 
The ministry estimates about 50 Romanian citizens are currently in Georgia.
Separately Monday, Romanian President Traian Basescu said Moldova is in no danger of becoming embroiled in a similar situation over Transdniester. 
Should conflict arise there, Romania will react differently, having learned lessons from elsewhere, Basescu said. 
He added that Romania respects Moldova's territorial integrity. 
The region of Transdniester separated from Moldova and declared independence in September 1990. 
Since then, the unrecognised country of Transdniester has been locked in conflict with Moldova.

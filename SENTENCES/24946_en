BUCHAREST, Romania -- Police seized 1.2 tonnes of cocaine Friday (January 30th) at the Black Sea port of Constanta, the most seized in Romania or the rest of Europe in the past decade, according to the Organised Crime and Anti-drug Combating Office (BCCOA).
The drugs, worth at least 100m euros, were found in two containers that arrived from Brazil in December, said BCCOA head Aurelian Pavel.
On Saturday, authorities issued arrest warrants for four members of a suspected crime ring.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Germany will complete the ratification procedure for the EU Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania in October, after the European Commission presents its next evaluation reports on the two countries, new German Ambassador to Bucharest Roland Lohkamp said on Monday (18 September). 
At a news conference, Lohkamp said he hopes Romania registers the progress necessary for EU admission in January, as planned.
In other news Monday, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said his National Liberal Party have proposed opening the files from the Communist-era Securitate archives on all high-ranking officials from the ruling coalition. 
The move would be aimed at ending speculation emerging in recent months. 
Later Monday, Emil Boc, leader of the other senior coalition partner, the Democratic Party, backed the move.
Also on Monday, anti-corruption prosecutors presented former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase the full documentation related to the abuse of office and corruption indictment filed against him. 
He later made a statement, insisting the charges were fabricated and politically motivated.

ATHENS, Greece -- A court in Athens ruled on Friday (December 24th) that a strike by civil aviation staff scheduled for December 29th and 30th is illegal.
Challenging the planned strike in court was the Civil Aviation Service.
After the ruling, the civil aviation labour union, OSYPA, said members would resort to other forms of protest against the government's austerity measures that affect their sector, but did not elaborate.
Meanwhile, labour unions in the transport sector said their strikes will continue after the Christmas holidays.
Bus drivers and staff in Athens are planning work stoppages on Wednesday, as well as on January 3rd, 5th and 10th.

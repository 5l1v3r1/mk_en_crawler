TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Democratic Party (DP) on Sunday (2 May) rejected proposals in President Alfred Moisiu's new report on electoral reform, which was released Saturday. 
DP Deputy Chairman Jozefina Topalli took issue with Moisiu's claim that a politically balanced Central Electoral Commission was unnecessary. 
Topalli says political balance is a requirement of the European Commission.

ROME, Italy -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling is lobbying for the gradual relaxation of current visa restrictions faced by BiH citizens.
According to Schwarz-Schilling, BiH has made significant progress in completing its reform agenda.
"Moving ahead on visa facilitation as proposed by the European Commission would send a powerful signal to BiH's authorities and citizens that the EU recognises this progress," he said.
He is set to discuss the issue with numerous senior officials during his visit to Rome, where he is attending the congress of the European People's Party.

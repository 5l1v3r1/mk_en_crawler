SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic on Thursday (13 November) apologised to the people of BiH for the "evil" they suffered in the 1990s.
He went on to say that individuals rather than nations were responsible for the atrocities that took place during the conflict.
"With open arms to each other, we need to go forward together.
I believe in a European future for both countries," he added.
The apology, at a press conference in Sarajevo, surprised local officials.
"We are encouraged and respect this," said Dragan Covic, chairman of the country's tripartite presidency.
BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic suggested it is time politicians in BiH think about apologising, as crimes were committed on all sides.
Also Thursday, BiH's and Serbia-Montenegro's foreign ministers signed an agreement on scientific-technical co-operation and cross-border travel.

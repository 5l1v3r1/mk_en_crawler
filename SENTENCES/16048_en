ISTANBUL, Turkey -- At least 34 people, including three policemen, were injured after a bomb exploded in a crowded pedestrian area in the Istanbul neighbourhood of Bakirkoy on Sunday (16 April) evening.
Officials are ruling out initial reports of a gas leak, saying instead that the blast was the result of a percussion-type grenade, dropped into a garbage bin.
Most of the wounded were hit by flying glass from windows of nearby buildings.
Two of the injuries are serious.
Police suspect the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
In other news, Istanbul police chief Celalettin Cerrah said on Friday that officers had detained six suspected members of the militant group Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, in connection with a bomb found aboard a bus carrying Turkish judicial officials last week.
According to Cerrah, the suspects underwent training in PKK camps abroad.
Also Friday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on all ethnic groups in Turkey to co-operate and act jointly to resolve current tensions.
He particularly appealed to Turkey's Kurdish population to trust the state over PKK terrorists.

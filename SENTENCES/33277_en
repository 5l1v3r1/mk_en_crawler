PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Polls opened in Montenegro on Sunday (11 May), with 458,367 eligible voters expected to cast their ballots in presidential elections.Two previous elections failed due to low turnout, but the Montenegrin Parliament has since removed a provision requiring at least 50 per cent turnout to make the elections valid.
Polls show former Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic with a comfortable lead over Liberal Alliance nominee Miodrag Zivkovic and independent Dragan Hajdukovic.
The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights has deployed a 70-member international observation mission to monitor the elections.
The first unofficial results are expected shortly before midnight on Sunday.

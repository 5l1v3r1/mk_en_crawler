PRISTINA, Kosovo -- German Ambassador to Kosovo Hans-Dieter Steinbach and General Secretary of the European Network of Election Monitoring Organisations (ENEMO) Constantin Marza signed an agreement Thursday (November 5th) that enables ENEMO to monitor Kosovo's November 15th municipal elections.
Germany has allocated 146,532 euros for this project.
Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission, in co-ordination with the Interior Ministry and the International Civilian Office, decided on Thursday that citizens will be allowed to show IDs issued by UNMIK on Election Day, despite the fact these documents have been invalid for two months now.
Earlier this week, authorities announced that Serbian passports will also be accepted as identification at the polls.

VAN, Turkey -- A landmark trial involving two military officers and a Kurdish informant began in the city of Van on Thursday (4 May). 
Observers see the trial as a major test of the country's readiness to meet EU standards of democracy. 
The defendants are accused of blowing up a bookstore in November to incite unrest among the Kurdish population in the region. 
A local prosecutor was fired recently for claiming that top-ranking army officers were behind the plot.
In other news Thursday, Joost Lagendijk, co-chairman of the EU-Turkey joint parliamentary committee, expressed EU concerns regarding Turkey's reform progress during a committee session and meeting with Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. 
Lagendijk acknowledged progress in some areas, but stressed that the continuation of reforms is essential. 
He also told reporters that the European Parliament condemned Wednesday's terrorist attack in Hakkari, in which 21 people were wounded.

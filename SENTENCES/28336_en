BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic opened a round table in Belgrade on fighting corruption and organised crime in Southeast Europe on Thursday (June 17th). 
In describing Serbia's efforts, he insisted no one is protected from facing trial, regardless of their political affiliation, family ties or social status. 
He also underscored the country's commitment to EU integration and its wish to contribute to regional and European stability. 
Justice Minister Snezana Malovic added that the efficient fight against organised crime and corruption requires "a change of mentality" and establishing "a new system of values". 
Attending the conference were public and state prosecutors from the Western Balkans, OSCE representatives, representatives of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Serbia, and officials from the justice ministries of France and the United States.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Police are closing in on an underworld boss and ally of Slobodan Milosevic who is the main suspect in last month's assassination of the late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, authorities said Tuesday (1 April). 
In a statement, police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic and a fake Croatian passport issued in Milorad Lukovic's name -- a find which they say will speed up his arrest. 
Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the leader of the Zemun organised crime gang, has been linked to politically motivated killings during Milosevic's autocratic rule. 
In a possible reference to the 2000 murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic, the interior ministry said Lukovic and his accomplices "killed political opponents" of Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic. 
On Monday at The Hague, Milosevic denied responsibility and said a campaign was being waged against him and his family.
UN war crimes tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann meanwhile is refusing to comment on reports that Lukovic has contacted prosecutors and is ready to cut a deal, by providing key information about the two most wanted indictees -- Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
In other news Monday, the parliament of Serbia-Montenegro adopted the charter of the Council of Europe (CoE), paving the way for admission into the European rights organisation during a ceremony Thursday. 
Federal Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic reiterated the importance of CoE entry, calling it the first step towards EU accession.

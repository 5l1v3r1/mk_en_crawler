PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Officials in Pristina on Monday (July 6th) welcomed the European Commission (EC) decision that visa liberalisation should apply only to citizens with exact addresses within Serbia, and not citizens living on Kosovo's territory. 
Therefore, Kosovo residents holding Serbian biometric passports will not benefit from Serbia's visa liberalisation with the EU. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu said Kosovo citizens should understand they must apply for Kosovo documents.
In other news, Kosovo and Albania plan to sign a border agreement to allow citizens of both countries to undergo processing at a single point, local media reported Tuesday. 
The agreement, scheduled for implementation in two weeks, will extend to a one-stop shop for customs officers and border police. 
Since the Durres-Kukes Highway opened in Albania and tourist season is under way, back-ups are common at the border.

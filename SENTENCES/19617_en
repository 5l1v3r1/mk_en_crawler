ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said that although Turkey has the right to defend itself against attacks by the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), it must exercise restraint in terms of any cross-border operation against PKK camps in northern Iraq. 
D'Alema, in Istanbul on Thursday (November 22nd) meeting with Turkish counterpart Ali Babacan, called for extensive dialogue with Iraq to resolve the crisis peacefully.
Meanwhile, the Zaman newspaper reports on Friday that US forces in Iraq have arrested two of the PKK's veteran leaders, Murat Karayilan and Cemil Bayik, and are preparing to extradite them to Turkey.

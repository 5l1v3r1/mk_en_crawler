BELGRADE, Serbia -- Kicking off a two-day to Belgrade on Tuesday (25 July), US envoy for the Kosovo status negotiations Frank Wisner praised the opening of direct status talks in Vienna this week but said the process must be intensified.
"A constructive approach is needed, in order to secure peace and democracy, and protection of the rights of all Kosovo citizens," he said.
Wisner held talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic a day after the first meeting between Belgrade and Pristina leaders took place in Vienna.
He also met with representatives of the Serbian Orthodox Church to discuss the protection of religious and cultural heritage in Kosovo.
As he wrapped up the visit Wednesday, he stressed that the United States does not want to pre-determine a solution for Kosovo.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The president of parliament's national committee for monitoring EU accession negotiations, Vesna Pusic, predicted on Thursday (July 8th) that the negotiation process should be completed by February 2011, which would allow the country to sign the accession treaty during the EU summit in March. 
She added that the majority of the remaining 13 chapters will be closed at the intergovernmental conferences this year: in late July, October and December. 
Negotiations to close the judiciary and competition chapters are likely to be most difficult and will probably stretch into early next year. 
Completing negotiations for competition, for example, will require meeting several benchmarks, including the restructuring of shipyards and steel mills.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders are considering the option of declaring the province an independent state, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said Thursday (9 November). 
He made it clear that the move would be made only if there is a delay in the determination of the province's future status and if the solution suggested by UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari falls short of statehood. 
"I'm not threatening the UN Security Council," Ceku said. 
Meanwhile, Skender Hyseni, the spokesman for the ethnic Albanian negotiators at the status talks in Vienna, urged the international Contact Group for Kosovo to announce a deadline for determining Kosovo's future at its meeting on Friday.
The statements followed reports that the international community might delay its decision on Kosovo until after the Serbian parliamentary elections in January.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The UN will accept partial responsibility for the deaths of two protestors shot by UNMIK police in February 2007, the Kosovo-based daily Koha Ditore reported on Thursday (October 1st), citing sources.
They say that UN headquarters in New York, in consultation with UNMIK officials in Pristina, has agreed to offer compensation to the families of those killed.
The amount has not been determined.
The two protestors were killed and 70 others injured after police intervened to suppress a protest by the group Vetevendosje (Self-Determination).
The incident led to the resignation of Interior Minister Fatmir Rexhepi and UNMIK Police Commissioner Stephen Curtis.
In April 2007, UNMIK Special Prosecutor Robert Dean issued a report on the events, concluding that Romanian police officers were responsible for wounding four people, including the two who died.

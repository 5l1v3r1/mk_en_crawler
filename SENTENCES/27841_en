BELGRADE, Serbia -- US Ambassador to Belgrade Mary Warlick says Washington does not expect Serbia to recognise Kosovo's independence, adding recognition is not a condition for bilateral relations.
In an interview with Vecernje Novosti on Friday (June 25th), she stressed that the US expects Serbia and Kosovo to find pragmatic solutions that will improve the quality of life for everyone in Kosovo -- Serbs and Albanians alike.
She added that any statements about reopening status talks or partitioning Kosovo will only veer Serbia from the path to EU integration path.
The newspaper says there had been suggestions that Belgrade establish good relations with Pristina if it wants to join the EU.

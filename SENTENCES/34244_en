ATHENS, Greece -- The new cabinet will be sworn in Monday (7 July), following a reshuffle aimed at bolstering the ruling PASOK party's position in May 2004 parliamentary elections.
Prime Minister Costas Simitis made the changes Friday in a move seen as broadening the government's political base.
The decision followed Thursday's reshuffle of the PASOK's leadership.
The changes did not affect the key ministries.
Simitis also appointed two new deputy interior ministers, representing factions to the left and right of mainstream PASOK policies.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Talks on resolving the Cypriot issue are expected to continue in 2009, UN Special Envoy Alexander Downer said on Thursday (November 13th) after the latest meeting between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. 
Downer explained the decades-long dispute requires time to resolve. 
Direct talks between the northern and the southern parts of the divided island began on September 3rd in a fresh effort by leaders of the two communities to resolve the stalemate. 
Downer said he would not set any deadline to reach an agreement. 
The two sides meet again on Monday, when discussions about the judiciary continue and negotiations on the disputed property issue begin.

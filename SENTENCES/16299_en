THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- In talks Thursday (13 April) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic, UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte raised the issue of arresting fugitive indictee Radovan Karadzic. 
She stressed the responsibility of Republika Srpska (RS) and other authorities in finding and apprehending Karadzic, as well as other indictees.
Separately Thursday, RS Interior Minister Stanislav Cadjo denied that Karadzic is in RS, but said his ministry would co-operate with the UN tribunal.

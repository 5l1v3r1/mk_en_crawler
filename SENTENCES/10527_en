LISBON, Portugal -- The foreign ministry issued a statement on Tuesday (16 November) saying Portugal supports the launching of accession talks with Turkey and is opposed to the notion of granting Ankara the status of a privileged partner instead.
"Portugal does not accept Plan B as an alternative to membership negotiations," a spokesman told reporters.
France has signalled that it might support the idea of privileged partner status, as might Austria and the Netherlands, according to some media reports.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan travels to Luxembourg on Wednesday to lobby for full membership in the Union.

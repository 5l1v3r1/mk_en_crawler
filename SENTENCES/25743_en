ZAGREB, Croatia -- Outgoing President Stipe Mesic said on Tuesday (January 19th) that he would intervene militarily if Republika Srpska (RS) tried to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The statement was immediately dismissed by President-elect Ivo Josipovic, who said "sending Croatian Army to a neighbouring country for me is not an option".
Josipovic takes office next month.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliament voted Monday (29 December) to adopt a new tax law package that would introduce a single VAT rate across the country and unite the customs administrations of the two entities into a single centralised administration. 
The new measures would take effect in 2005. 
The EU made this one of several conditions BiH must meet if it wants to sign an association agreement, the first step towards membership. 
Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, has indicated that tax and customs fraud were costing the country more than 600m euros.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal have asked the court to summon as a witness former British diplomat Lord David Owen, in the trial against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
According to a statement Wednesday (June 10th), Owen, who served as EU envoy in the 1992-1995 conflict negotiations, "met the defendant 25 times, apart from their telephone conversation and written correspondence," prosecutors said. 
Owen co-authored the 1993 Vance-Owen peace plan, which failed to resolve the conflict.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal decided Friday (1 July) not to transfer the case of the so-called "Vukovar Three" to a local court in Croatia or Serbia. 
Prosecutors cited the "extreme intensity of feeling" in the two countries as the reason for the decision. 
Miroslav Radic, Veselin Sljivancanin and Mile Mrksic are accused of complicity in the murder of 264 Croats in Vukovar in November 1991. 
The three pleaded not guilty in their first appearances before the ICTY.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament rejected on Wednesday (December 6th) a motion to dismiss Education and Science Minister Sulejman Rushiti.
It had been submitted by the main ethnic Albanian opposition coalition, consisting of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and the Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP).
DUI-PDP said Rushiti's decision to replace the management of Tetovo University was politicised and threatened the autonomy of the institution.
But the governing parties said Rushiti's decision was correct, in light of legal violations uncovered at the university.

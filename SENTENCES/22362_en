PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Lawmakers adopted their new country's national anthem Wednesday (June 11th), nearly four months after Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia.
The vote at the special session was 72 to 15 with five abstentions.
Composed by Mehdi Mendxiqi, the anthem is a melody without lyrics called "Europe".
It complies with the principle, stipulated in former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, by which new symbols must take into account the multiethnic character of the state.
The competition for composing a national anthem began immediately after Kosovo declared independence in February.
More than 130 composers took part.
Kosovo's constitution goes into effect on Sunday.

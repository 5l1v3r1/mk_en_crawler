TETOVO, Macedonia -- The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), the ethnic Albanian partner in Macedonia's coalition government, officially merged with the smaller National Democratic Party of Albanians (NDPA) on Friday (20 June).
The leaders of the two parties -- DUI's Ali Ahmeti and NDPA's Kastriot Hadzirexha -- signed a joint declaration providing that the new union would act in the future under DUI's name, symbols and political platform.
Afterwards, Ahmeti said DUI would remain open to co-operation with all ethnic Albanian political powers, while Hadzirexha stressed that the consolidation would contribute to the implementation of the Ohrid peace agreement.
In a separate development, as expected, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) decided on Friday to end its almost three-month boycott of parliament.
DPA also announced its merger with the smaller Republican Party.
On Saturday meanwhile, the ethnic Albanian Party of Democratic Prosperity elected a new leader, Abdulemenaf Bexheti, who succeds Abdurahman Aliti.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU security chief Javier Solana is warning Turkey that a possible cross-border military operation in northern Iraq would only further complicate the security situation there. 
"The question of security continues to be a fundamental issue to the stability of Iraq," Solana told reporters in Brussels on Thursday (October 11th). 
:"I think that any possibility of complicating even more the security situation in Iraq is something that should not be welcomed." The European Commission also appealed to Turkey to refrain from such a move.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he will ask parliament next week to approve a military operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) camps in northern Iraq. 
According to Erdogan, Turkey must resort to a military campaign because the United States and Iraq have failed to help it deal with cross-border attacks by the PKK.

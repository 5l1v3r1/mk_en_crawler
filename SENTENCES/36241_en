SKOPJE, Macedonia -- In an interview for <I>Dnevnik</I> daily, published Wednesday (3 March), European Commission President Romano Prodi said he expects the forthcoming presidential elections in Macedonia to be conducted in a democratic way. 
Under terms of the constitution, new presidential elections must be held within 40 days. 
Prodi said he hoped the new head of state would continue the late President Boris Trajkovski's work towards unity, ethnic integration and intensified co-operation with the EU. 
Trajkovski died in an airplane crash in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) last week, and his funeral will be held on Friday. 
Macedonia's Interior Ministry has said it will prepare unprecedented security measures for the high-ranking international delegations expected to be in attendance.
Meanwhile, SFOR again rejected speculation that the NATO-led force bore responsibility for the accident that killed Trajkovski and eight others. 
SFOR's spokesman Dave Sullivan emphasised that SFOR is fully assisting with the investigation launched by the BiH government.

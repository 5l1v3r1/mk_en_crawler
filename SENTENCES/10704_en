SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Campaigning ahead of the 7 November referendum on Macedonia's new decentralisation laws started Friday (8 October). 
The nationalist World Macedonian Congress, which initiated the poll, and opposition parties kicked it off with a rally in downtown Skopje. 
They insist the referendum will not jeopardise ethnic stability nor Euro-Atlantic integration and is not directed against the Ohrid Framework Agreement. 
But on Friday, both Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Hari Kostov said the initiative could lead to instability.

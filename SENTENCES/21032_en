WASHINGTON, United States --State Department spokesman Tom Casey said on Thursday (August 2nd) that Kosovo's final status will be determined after the Contact Group, together with three international representatives, sends a report on the results of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina to UN General-Secretary Ban Ki-Moon.
That will likely happen December 10th, according to Casey, who reiterated Ban's position that the status quo is unstable.
In other news, EU security chief Javier Solana has appointed Swedish diplomat Jonas Jonsson as his personal representative for Kosovo.
Jonsson, who succeeds Torbjorn Sohlstrom, will also serve as head of the International Civilian Office and the EU Special Representative Preparation Team in Pristina.

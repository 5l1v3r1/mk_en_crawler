PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Officials are reacting to Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic's idea of Kosovo partition as a long-term solution. 
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci emphasised on Monday (May 16th) that Serbia doesn't decide about Kosovo; instead, it is Kosovo citizens and international partners who make decisions. 
"Serbia's desires caused wars, genocide, and dissatisfaction throughout the region. 
I want to believe that they will change the chapter from a confrontation [era] into a co-operation era," Kuci said. 
He acknowledged Pristina institutions lack of control in the north but said this will change with help from EULEX and KFOR.
Meanwhile, International Civilian Representative Pieter Feith said that the International Steering Group member states are committed to Kosovo's territorial integrity, including in the north. 
A solution for should be based on three principles -- the north should remain part of Kosovo, there should be no violence, and the region should not remain a frozen conflict, Feith told the Belgrade-based newspaper Danas.

TIRANA, Albania -- Police will not tolerate members of the public blocking roadways as a form of protest, Interior Minister Lulzim Basha said on Monday (August 23rd).
Even those who support protests that disrupt commuters face arrest, said Basha during a visit to the Vlora police headquarters.
The area around the southern town has been a frequent scene of such protests for various reasons, including recently an incident where a member of the Greek minority was killed by a hit and run driver.
That led to a 14-hour road block that snarled traffic in the peak of tourist season.

ATHENS, Greece -- A wildfire destroyed dozens of homes in the affluent northern suburbs of Athens on Thursday (August 16th) before firefighters contained it. 
Hundreds of people fled their homes in the face of a 30m-high wall of fire, fueled by gale force winds. 
At least 10 local residents and a firefighter were treated for smoke inhalation. 
The blaze apparently began in a remote forest area above the Agios Panteleimonas municipality and reached Melissia two hours later.

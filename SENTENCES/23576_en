ZAGREB, Croatia -- Police have arrested eight people in connection with last week's train crash near the town of Split, local media reported on Monday (July 27th). 
The derailment killed six people and injured at least 50. 
Among those detained is Ivan Medak, responsible for ecology and protection in the state-run railway company, and two people who delivered a fire-prevention chemical substance sprayed on the tracks, which may have caused the accident. 
The country observed a day of mourning for the victims Monday. 
Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development Minister Bozidar Kalmeta vows that those responsible for the tragedy will be punished.

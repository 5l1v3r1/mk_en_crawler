SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Council of Ministers Chairman Adnan Terzic left for Brussels Monday (24 March) for talks on BiH's EU integration process. 
He is expected to discuss, with senior EU officials, the new obligations set by the Union as a pre-condition for starting talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. 
On Thursday, Terzic will visit The Hague for talks with chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
In Sarajevo Monday, the Federation of BiH's government issued a statement in support of High Representative Paddy Ashdown's initiative to resolve the political and administrative future of Mostar, the city still divided between Croats and Bosniaks. 
Ashdown wants to establish a special commission, representing all parties, that would work steadily from April through July.

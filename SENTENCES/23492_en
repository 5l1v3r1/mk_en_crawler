BELGRADE, Serbia -- Energy Ministry State Secretary Dusan Mrakic announced on Monday (December 22nd) that Serbia and Russia have successfully concluded talks on a crucial energy deal and initialled the agreement.
The package includes the sale of 51% of state oil and gas company NIS to Russia's Gazprom Neft, as well as two other contracts outlining Serbia's participation in the South Stream gas pipeline project and the modernisation of the Banatski Dvor gas depot.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev will sign the accord soon, possibly Wednesday.
The energy deal has strained relations in Serbia's ruling coalition after G17 Plus took a stand against it, arguing the sale price of NIS is too low and there are no guarantees Russia will implement the other two projects.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following talks with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Sarajevo on Sunday (19 December), High Representative Paddy Ashdown reiterated that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains the major condition for BiH's integration into the EU. 
Ashdown added that Rehn's visit, so soon after his appointment to the post, underscores the importance Brussels attaches to the start of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with BiH.
In other news, the OSCE Mission to BiH presented a report Friday acknowledging that the country's courts have made substantial progress in implementing the new criminal procedure code. 
The report assessed progress over the past year.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Valentin Inzko met with the Collegia of both houses of parliament Tuesday (April 7th) to call for a faster legislative process.
At its last session, the Peace Implementation Council blamed sluggish parliamentary work -- in part -- for the disappointing pace of reforms.
Inzko insists that Europe's commitment to BiH must be matched by a commitment from BiH to address the necessary reforms.
He said the recent adoption of the constitutional amendment on the Brcko District's status is one example of constructive work and urged parliament members to use that momentum to address the EU agenda.
In other news Tuesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt visited Sarajevo and said BiH is not ready to apply for EU candidate status.
Bildt, whose country assumes the EU's rotating presidency in July, arrived in Sarajevo along with Czech and French foreign ministers Karel Schwarzenberg and Bernard Kouchner for talks with BiH's leaders about the pace of reforms needed towards EU accession.

ATHENS, Greece -- Opposition parties on Tuesday (May 24th) rejected the new tax policies and privatisations announced by the government in an effort to overcome the debt crisis. 
Prime Minister George Papandreou started a new round of talks aimed at convincing party leaders of the pressing need for the measures. 
His attempts, however, were strongly criticised by the opposition. 
"I will not agree with a recipe that is a proved failure," said Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party. 
Under pressure from the EU and the markets, the ruling PASOK party announced it would carry out "extraordinary" privatisations and will introduce a new tax policy, hoping to collect another 1.6 billion euros this year.

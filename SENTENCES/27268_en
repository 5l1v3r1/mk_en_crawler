THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic asked the UN war crimes tribunal Monday (February 1st) to delay the resumption of his trial, now set for March 1st. 
He says he did not have enough time to prepare his defence, citing a lack of money for his legal team and the fact that he was not allowed to choose his standby lawyer. 
Karadzic's trial opened in October but was suspended almost immediately due to his refusal to attend the sessions. 
Prosecutors are moving forward, filing a list of the first 30 witnesses they plan to call.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Interior Minister Ivica Dacic has rejected claims that three Serbs arrested in Kosovo earlier this week were members of the Security Intelligence Agency of Serbia.
"It is absolutely not true that those arrested are members of our security structures," he said Friday (June 12th).
"Since 1999, the interior ministry does not have a single member in Kosovo." He condemned the allegations as "a politically motivated campaign" aiming to further raise tensions.
Also on Friday, the spokesman for the Serbian war crimes prosecutor's office, Bruno Vekaric, said the arrests were a bid to discredit an ongoing probe into alleged organ harvesting during the Kosovo war.
Media reports in Kosovo have been claiming the three detained men were bribing Kosovo Serbs to give false testimony about the case.

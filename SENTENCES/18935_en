PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Kosovo Albanian leaders reiterated Tuesday (July 3rd) that Pristina might look for alternative scenarios for achieving independence if the UN Security Council fails to adopt a resolution based on the Ahtisaari plan.
Prime Minister Agim Ceku told Reuters that the province might be "forced to move" alone if delays in the status settlement process continue.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu seemed to agree, telling the BBC's Albanian-language programme that Kosovo would consult the international community to find an alternative way to independence, even if this means seeking recognition by individual states.

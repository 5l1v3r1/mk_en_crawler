ANKARA, Turkey -- Police cracked down on a nationalist organisation suspected of involvement in last year's murder of journalist Hrant Dink and other politically-motivated attacks, Turkish media reported on Wednesday (January 23rd). 
The 33-member group is blamed for attacks on priests and is being investigated for alleged plans to attack Kurdish politicians. 
Group members were arrested in Istanbul early Tuesday.
In other news, two members of the Turkish security forces went on trial Tuesday in connection with Dink's murder. 
The two members of the Gendarmerie, a paramilitary force, are accused of failing to prevent a crime. 
The uncle of 17-year-old Yasin Hayal, who gunned down Dink a year ago, testified he had told the two defendants about the conspiracy three or four months in advance.

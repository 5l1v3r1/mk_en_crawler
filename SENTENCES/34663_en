ANKARA, Turkey -- The government is expected to meet on Monday (25 August) to discuss a US request for the deployment of Turkish troops to Iraq.
Ankara's top political and military leaders on the National Security Council met on Friday and issued a statement saying Iraq's stability continues to be a foreign policy priority.
The council said it is watching closely "developments in the international arena", a reference to the possibility of a new UN Security Council resolution on Iraq.
In an interview published on Saturday, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey is considering dispatching about 10,000 soldiers.
He added that Turkish delegations are in Baghdad trying to negotiate common ground with US officials on a variety of issues, including security in northern Iraq.

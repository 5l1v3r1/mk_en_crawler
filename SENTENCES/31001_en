ATHENS, Greece -- Youth clashed with police Monday (December 6th) during a rally to mark two years since the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy, which sparked massive riots across the country.
About 4,000 people joined the march to the parliament building in Athens, some hurling rocks, oranges and flares at a Finance Ministry building.
Police used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse a group who smashed up paving stones and tore out traffic signs to throw at the officers.
The protestors set bins on fire, smashed glass phone booths and broke the windows of several banks and stores.
No arrests were reported.
A rally and march in Thessaloniki was held amid heavy police presence.
Demonstrations are also planned for Tuesday when IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn is due to start a two-day visit to Athens.

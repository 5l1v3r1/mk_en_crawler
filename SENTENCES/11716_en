ANKARA, Turkey -- The US Embassy in Ankara on Thursday (17 February) has dismissed press reports suggesting that US military activity in northern Iraq is intended to prevent Turkish intervention there.
"Any suggestion that any US military activity in northern Iraq is directed against Turkey, a long-standing ally and NATO partner, is false.
The United States and Turkey have ongoing dialogue on our shared interests and concerns in Iraq,'' the embassy said.

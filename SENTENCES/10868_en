BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Ion Iliescu has officially accepted an invitation from the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) to return as head of the party after his term expires.
Iliescu sent a letter Wednesday (1 September) to the current PSD leader, Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, saying that he was honoured by the partyâ€™s trust.
Term limits prevent him from seeking re-election as president.
Also Wednesday, Romania's air forces began participating in a NATO drill in Turkey.
Romania is one of the 18 Alliance members taking part in the exercises, which will continue until 17 September.

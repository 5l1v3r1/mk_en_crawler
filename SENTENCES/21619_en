BUCHAREST, Romania -- Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a report Tuesday (April 22nd) by the commission investigating alleged CIA detention centres in Romania. 
The document denies the existence of such facilities as well as the alleged existence of US secret bases. 
Furthermore, it denies the involvement of any domestic institutions or officials in the illegal transport of terror suspects through Romanian territory. 
Bucharest came under pressure to investigate the matter after several international institutions and various media accused both Romania and Poland of hosting secret CIA detention facilities.

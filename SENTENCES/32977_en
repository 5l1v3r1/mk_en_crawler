IZMIT, Turkey -- Efforts to join the EU are a preference and a goal that is not subject to discussion, Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said Sunday (25 May) at the Kocaeli Central Town Congress of the ruling Justice and Development Party. 
EU officials who used to say Turkey could not join the Union in less than 15 years have started to cite dates as early as 2008, Gonul added.
Also Sunday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed press reports that suggested recently proposed legislative amendments are a source of tension between the government and the military. 
The reform package proposes amendments to harmonise Turkish legislation with that of the EU.

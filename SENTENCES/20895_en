SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The newly formed rightist party Citizens for Bulgaria's European Development (GERB) has won the mayoral races in Bulgaria's biggest cities, according to exit poll results.
In a run-off vote Sunday (November 4th), GERB carried the major port city of Burgas, as well as the provincial capitals of Vidin, Sliven, Gabrovo, Ztara Zagora and Yambol.
The party's candidates were elected mayors of Sofia and Plovdiv, Bulgaria's two largest cities, and in several other provincial capitals in round one a week ago.
Sofia's re-elected mayor and GERB leader Boyko Borisov is now urging the government to resign, saying the ruling tripartite majority no longer reflects political realities in the country.

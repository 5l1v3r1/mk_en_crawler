BUCHAREST, Romania -- Two of the most important and active NGOs in Romania, the Asociatia Pro Democratia and the Media Monitoring Agency, filed a public petition with the Bucharest Court of Appeals on Wednesday (November 11th), asking for the suspension of a referendum called by President Traian Basescu. 
If passed, the referendum would turn the bicameral parliament into a unicameral one, reducing the number of members from 471 to 300. 
The referendum is scheduled for the same date as the presidential election, November 22nd.
Cristian Parvulescu, president of the Asociatia Pro Democratia, says the referendum should instead offer the opportunity to choose between transforming parliament's structure and reducing the number of lawmakers. 
He added that it gives Basescu a clear advantage, as his face will appear on posters both for the referendum and the presidential elections -- effectively unlevelling the playing field for other candidates.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The tripartite presidency announced on Thursday (December 27th) that it has nominated Nikola Spiric for prime minister of the central government. 
Spiric resigned from the post on November 1st during a row with Miroslav Lajcak, the international high representative who oversees progress towards stability and democracy. 
The dispute was resolved at the end of November when all major parties formally accepted proposed changes that would prevent politicians from blocking decisions by staging walkouts. 
Spiric's nomination is expected to be approved by the central parliament. 
His new government is expected to be virtually identical to his former one.
In other news, Defence Minister Selmo Cikotic said in an interview with Nezavisne Novine on Thursday that his country could be invited to join NATO sometime between 2012 and 2015. 
The timing of actual accession will depend on the pace of reforms and on BiH's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, he added.

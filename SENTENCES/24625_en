ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested around 40 people Wednesday (January 7th) as part of their investigation of the ultra-nationalist organisation Ergenekon, which allegedly plotted to stage a coup d'etat.
Three retired generals are among those arrested.
A total of 86 people, most of them military officers, politicians and lawyers, face charges so far.
Wednesday's operation swept up suspects simultaneously in six districts, including Ankara and Istanbul.

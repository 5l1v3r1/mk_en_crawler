PRISTINA, Kosovo -- KFOR Commander Xavier de Bout Marnhac accused Kosovo Serb leaders on Wednesday (February 20th) of involvement in the recent arson attacks on two border checkpoints between Kosovo and Serbia.
"Some local leaders in northern Kosovo took huge responsibility yesterday," Marnhac told journalists.
The Jarinje and Banja border checkpoints were closed on Wednesday after at least 1,000 Serbs from Kosovo and Serbia ransacked them and set them on fire, in retaliation for Pristina's unilateral declaration of independence.
Kosovo Serb leader Milan Ivanovic dismissed Marnhac's accusations as "ridiculous".

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The ruling coalitions of Serbia and Montenegro failed to reach agreement Monday (10 March) on the composition of the federal cabinet. 
The For European Montenegro coalition and Serbia's Democratic Opposition of Serbia were expected to distribute the minister seats. 
Parliament will meet again Thursday to discuss the cabinet.
Also Monday, Montenegrin Parliament Speaker and acting President Filip Vujanovic announced that presidential elections in the republic would take place on 11 May. 
Nominees have until 21 April to register. 
Vujanovic himself is likely to run again after winning most votes in two previous attempts.

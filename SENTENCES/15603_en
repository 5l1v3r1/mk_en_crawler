WASHINGTON, United States -- Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns is urging both houses of the BiH Parliament to adopt crucial constitutional changes hammered out by the main BiH political parties. 
His comments came during a joint news conference Friday (21 April) with High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling, following talks in Washington. 
Burns said that the United States continues to work closely with both the Office of the High Representative and the EU to promote the BiH constitutional reform process.
US Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried also called for passage of the constitutional amendments' package, in an interview published in Monday's (24 April) edition of Dnevni avaz. 
He stressed that the issue is key to BiH's future and Euro-Atlantic integration.
In other news, the Bosnian government and the World Bank have agreed to launch a $286.6m project aimed at modernising the country's electricity grid -- the largest investment in post-war BiH. 
The World Bank will provide a $36m loan and the rest will come from the EBRD, the European Investment Bank and the German KFW Bank Group.

LONDON, United Kingdom -- The Kosovo Embassy in London received a note Tuesday (April 13th) informing it that Swaziland has recognised Kosovo's independence, the 66th country to do so since Pristina's declaration of independence in February 2008.
New Kosovo Alliance party leader Bexhet Pacolli had announced as much last week, though the foreign ministry said it had not been informed.

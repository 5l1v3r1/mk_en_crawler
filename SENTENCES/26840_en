PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The head of the Islamic community in BiH, Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceric, kicked off a three-day visit to Kosovo on Thursday (August 6th) for meetings with counterpart Naim Trnava and Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu. 
Ceric will visit several cultural monuments, including three mosques that are more than 600 years old. 
A memorandum for co-operation in various areas between representatives of BiH and Kosovo Islamic communities will be signed. 
About 50,000 Bosniaks live in Kosovo, mainly in Prizren, Mitrovica and Dragas.
Ceric's trip has angered Bosnian Serbs because it was billed as a visit to the "Islamic community in the Republic of Kosovo". 
Republika Srpska and Serbia refuse to recognise Kosovo's independence.

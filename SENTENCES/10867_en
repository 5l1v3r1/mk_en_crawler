NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The first service in three decades was held at the Greek Orthodox church of Aya Mamas in Guzelyurt, a Turkish-controlled town in Cyprus on Wednesday (1 September).
The service was held despite a bomb attack last week that damaged the church's structure.
Mehmet Ali Talat, prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, said his government wants to promote peace and reconciliation on the divided island.

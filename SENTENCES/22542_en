PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo could suffer permanent isolation if it fails to join the EU in the next ten years, US diplomat and Dayton Accord architect Richard Holbrooke said on Tuesday (September 9th). 
Visiting Pristina, Holbrooke addressed parliament, saying he expects international recognition of Kosovo's independence to continue. 
He also called on Kosovo institutions to focus more on economic development.
In other news Tuesday, Kosovo leaders received their first diplomatic passports. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni received them at a ceremony in Pristina. 
They also met with Kosovo's first ten charges d'affaires.

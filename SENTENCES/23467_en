ZAGREB, Croatia -- Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said on Thursday (March 26th) that Croatia will continue to insist its EU accession talks be separate from its ongoing maritime border dispute with Slovenia. 
At a news conference following a meeting with Slovenian counterpart Samuel Zbogar and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, Jandrokovic urged Slovenia to immediately unblock EU negotiations and reiterated that the border dispute should go to the International Court of Justice. 
He did not comment on Rehn's new proposal aimed at finding common ground. 
The EU backs the signing of a joint statement that says no document or act after the two states gained independence would prejudge the border conflict.
Also Thursday, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor hinted at progress, saying there was a significant change in the intensity of talks. 
As for Croatia's NATO bid, Pahor said his country will forward the relevant document to Washington as soon as possible, so Croatia becomes a full-fledged NATO member at next week's Alliance summit.

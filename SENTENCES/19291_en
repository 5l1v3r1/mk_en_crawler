SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Foreign Investors' Council (FIC) issued recommendations Saturday (January 26th) on ten main reforms aimed at strengthening BiH's business environment and attracting more investment. 
Among the measures are establishing an electronic commercial registry, which would facilitate start-ups of new companies. 
The Council also called on BiH institutions to publish or make available online all the documents and procedures required for different types of licenses and permits, boost transparency within public administration and reduce corruption. 
It also called for harmonisation of tax laws among Republika Srpska, the Federation of BiH and Brcko District. 
In addition, the FIC proposes reduced customs duties and establishment of a common Southeast European market.

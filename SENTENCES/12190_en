SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Following Agron Buxhaku's withdrawal from consideration for the post of transport and communications minister in the new cabinet, the junior government partner Democratic Union for Integration proposed Xhemail Mehazi for the post Monday (13 December).
Mehazi, 39, has been serving as state secretary at the finance ministry.
The proposal was submitted to Prime Minister-designate Vlado Buckovski, who immediately forwarded it to parliament.
In other news, NATO Director for the Balkans Robert Serry arrived in Skopje on Tuesday to discuss the political and security situation in Macedonia.
Chief among the issues is the problem of armed militants in Kondovo, a village just west of Skopje.
Parliament's committee on security discussed the situation Monday, but reportedly reached no agreement on a strategy.

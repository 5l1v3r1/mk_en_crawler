SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Parliament passed the law on elementary and high school education Friday (6 June).
It was approved unanimously after a series of consultations and a number of amendments.
Sefik Dzaferovic, chairman of the House of Representatives, says the legislation is necessary, as the current education system is not compatible with EU standards and contains elements of segregation and discrimination.
The bill sets education standards, which would be valid across the BiH Federation.

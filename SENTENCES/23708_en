BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's latest proposal on resolving the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia broadly complies with Zagreb's requirements, Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said on Wednesday (April 22nd), following talks with EU and Slovenian officials in Brussels. 
According to Jandrokovic, the plan includes most of his country's criteria, such as separating the border issue from the EU integration process and unblocking Croatia's accession talks, as well as resolving the conflict in line with international law. 
The proposal will undergo further discussion in Zagreb before Croatia offers its final response. 
Rehn's proposal would establish a five-member arbitration panel. 
Croatia and Slovenia would each nominate one judge and then jointly decide on the other three. 
Should they fail to reach an agreement, the International Court of Justice will decide on the remaining three judges.

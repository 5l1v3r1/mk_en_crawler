Heavy floods have killed 20 people in Romania over a one-week period and have left thousands homeless, authorities said Sunday (17 July).
The floods, the result of torrential rains that have swollen rivers and dams, are said to be the worst to hit the country in 50 years.
The disaster has caused significant material damage, particularly in the eastern counties of Bacau, Braila, Galati and Vrancea.
The death toll was the highest in Vrancea, where 13 people were reportedly killed by the deluge, the Romanian news agency Rompres reported Sunday after a meeting of the country's National Emergency Committee, attended also by President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu.
"Our first priority at this moment is to save human lives," Reuters quoted Basescu as saying before leaving for the county of Buzau, south of Vrancea.
Tariceanu said he did not expect the death toll to rise further, as no more people are reported missing.
He said army helicopters are airlifting food, drinking water and other emergency aid to stranded villagers.
Efforts to pump away floodwater also are under way.
"The army will help the population with manpower and equipment," the prime minister said Sunday morning.
"Beds and tents have started to be distributed."
In 103 settlements across the four counties, more than 10,000 houses were flooded and 509 were completely destroyed, according to Rompres.
Over 11,000 people had to be evacuated.
Of a total of some 90,000 animals were killed by the floods, 20,000 died in the raging waters in Vrancea county alone.
About 85,000 hectares of farmland and nearly 1,300 hectares of pastures have been inundated and more than 550 bridges have been damaged or destroyed.
In addition, a total of nearly 500km of roads have been damaged.
Efforts to repair the infrastructure began Saturday with the help of military engineering troops.
Tariceanu promised that electricity, gas and water supplies would be restored as soon as possible.
The government has allocated around one billion new lei (about 280m euros) for the reconstruction of infrastructure and is seeking additional international aid.
The Romanian daily Ziua reported Monday that Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur has asked the EU to redirect 110m euros of the funds earmarked for Romania under the Sapard programme for investments in rural infrastructure and dams.
In talks Saturday with Stability Pact co-ordinator Erhard Busek, Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu appealed for assistance in coping with the flood situation, the Mediafax news agency reported.

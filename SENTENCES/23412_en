THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The trial of former war crimes tribunal spokeswoman Florence Hartmann will run from June 15th to June 17th, the UN tribunal announced on Friday (May 22nd).
She is charged with contempt of court for allegedly disclosing two confidential Court of Appeals decisions in Slobodan Milosevic's case in her books "Peace and Punishment" and "Vital Genocide Documents Concealed".
Hartmann's case was postponed in January when she filed a motion for the disqualification of two judges, who were later replaced.

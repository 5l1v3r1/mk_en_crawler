SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Small groups of Bosnian and Croatian soccer fans fought in the streets of Sarajevo hours before what was supposed to be a friendly match between the two countries' national teams. 
Around 80 fans, 40 on each side, hit each other with chairs and bottles in a cafÃ© in the city's downtown pedestrian zone before police moved in. 
Five people were treated for minor injuries and there were about 15 arrests. 
Inside the stadium, rioting erupted early in the second half of the match, forcing police to move in again. 
Croatia won the game, 5-3.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Police used tear gas and water cannons on Sunday (December 9th) to disperse protesters who gathered in Istanbul to voice support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
About 200 PKK supporters hit the streets of the Okmeydani quarter in Istanbul, chanting slogans in support of group leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been serving a life sentence in prison since 1999. 
The protesters threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the police, who in return used tear gas and water cannons. 
Similar clashes were reported in the Bagcilar district of Istanbul's suburbs.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Turkey may consider an amnesty for Kurdish separatists if they agree to put down their weapons and stop attacking Turkish targets.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian officials on Friday (April 23rd) hailed NATO's decision to offer BiH a Membership Action Plan (MAP).
Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj, who addressed a meeting of Alliance foreign ministers in Tallinn, Estonia, said that granting BiH the MAP would boost reforms and contribute to increased stability and security.
In Sarajevo, High Representative Valentin Inzko welcomed the NATO foreign ministers' decision and again called on Bosnian authorities to resolve the military property issue -- a condition cited by NATO for implementation of the MAP.
NATO said that BiH's first Annual National Programme would be accepted only when all defence facilities -- anything immovable -- are officially registered as the state property of BiH for use by the Defence Ministry.
Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik insists the two entities participate in that process.

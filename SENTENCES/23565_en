ATHENS, Greece -- Somali pirates on Saturday (April 25th) released the Greek ship Saldanha that was commandeered two months ago.
One of the pirates claims a 1.43m-euro ransom was paid for the freighter.
A Greek Merchant Marine Ministry official confirmed only that the ship and its crew of 22, including two Romanians, had been freed.
The Saldanha, sailing under the Maltese flag, was transporting coal from Indonesia to Slovenia when the pirates seized it near the Somali coast on February 22nd.

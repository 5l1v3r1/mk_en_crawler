SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The presidential campaign formally began Tuesday (30 March), with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski of the ruling SDSM coalition and Sasko Kedev of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE considered the front-runners.
Rounding out the field are Gim Ostreni of the Democratic Union for Integration and Zudi Xhelili of the Democratic Party of Albanians.
Observers doubt any one candidate will get more than 50 per cent of the vote in the first round on 14 April.
If no candidate passes the 50 per cent mark, a run-off will be held two weeks later.
The election was called after the 26 February plane crash that killed President Boris Trajkovski.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Warning Greece on Thursday (23 September) that it could face legal action for underestimating its budget deficits, the EU began an investigation into figures submitted by Athens prior to its entry into the euro zone.
Joaquin Almunia, EU monetary affairs commissioner, said the recent upward revisions of the Greek deficit were of a size and scope that raised serious concerns in the European Commission.
The EU would now try to establish whether Greece altered its pre-2000 figures to make itself eligible for joining the single European currency.
Greece has already revised its 2000 deficit to 4.1 per cent from a prior estimate of 2 per cent.
The 2001 and 2002 deficits now stand at 3.7 per cent, compared with the previously reported 1.4 per cent.
The EU has a 3 per cent ceiling on budget deficits.

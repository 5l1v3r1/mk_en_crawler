PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Six people were injured when a fire broke out at a natural-gas filling station in a central Pristina neighbourhood Saturday night (March 15th).
Three were injured very seriously, including one who suffered grave burns.
Residents of nearby buildings were evacuated for a short time but were later allowed to return home.
The initial investigation showed that improper security arrangements by the company delivering gas to the substation caused the fire.
President Fatmir Sejdiu urged relevant authorities to identify all dangerous gas and petrol stations in Pristina and take necessary measures.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Police arrested 17 people suspected of links with Turkish Hezbollah on Saturday (January 15th). 
The detentions came after nine suspected members of the group disappeared after they were released from prison under a new law limiting the time suspects can spend in detention. 
The arrests were made during raids in the southern provinces of Adana and Mersin. 
The nine suspected Hezbollah members disappeared Friday. 
An arrest warrant has been issued for them.

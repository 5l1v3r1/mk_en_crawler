SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former mujahid fighter Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad, also known as Ubejda, was deported from BiH to his homeland, Bahrain, on Monday (March 30th). 
He had spent the past several months in an Immigration Detention Centre after being released from a prison in Zenica, where he spent 12 years for plotting a 1998 car bombing in Mostar. 
He also testified in the trial of former BiH Army General Rasim Delic at The Hague war crimes tribunal. 
Because he fought in BiH, he received citizenship, which the country rescinded upon further review.

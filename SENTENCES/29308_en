SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Deputy High Representative in BiH Raffi Gregorian has called on the international community to take measures against the network supporting war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic in BiH.
In an interview with Sarajevo-based daily Oslobodjenje on Tuesday (August 3rd), Gregorian said this would help Serbia arrest Mladic.
"We cannot assume that Serbia alone can do something to arrest Ratko Mladic.
We can do many things in Bosnia to help [Belgrade] with its efforts," he added.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ODIHR will deploy ten monitors to observe the 12 December presidential runoff between Adrian Nastase and Traian Basescu, according to a statement issued Tuesday (7 December).
There were 18 ODIHR monitors in the first round, late last month.
Meanwhile, reports in the local media suggest that the European Parliament (EP) is expected to discuss the progress report on Romania on 15 December.
The document has already passed the EP's foreign affairs committee.

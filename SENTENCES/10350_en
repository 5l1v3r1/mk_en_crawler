ANKARA, Turkey -- Britain's Prince Charles is expected to arrive Sunday (24 October) on a two-day visit to Turkey, during which he will attend Monday's re-opening of the British Consulate in Istanbul.
Sixteen people, including the consul general, were killed when an al-Qaeda-linked group bombed the building on 15 October 2003.
The prince is also scheduled to meet Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara.

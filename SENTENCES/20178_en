BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Supreme Magistrates Council selected five new judges Thursday (October 18th) to serve on the presidential anti-graft commission.
It is aimed at approving criminal investigations into former or current cabinet ministers, if requested by prosecutors.
The previous presidential commission stopped all activity two weeks ago following an emergency government order.
The suspension was proposed by Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu, who is himself the subject of an investigation.

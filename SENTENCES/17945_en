ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Zagreb daily Jutarnji list has published a letter purportedly written by Geoffrey Nice, the UN war crimes tribunal's former lead attorney in the case against the late Slobodan Milosevic.
It asserts that tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte struck a secret deal with Serbian leaders in 2003, allowing Belgrade to keep confidential a "reasonable" part of its wartime military archives -- including documents establishing the former Yugoslavia's role in the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia.
In exchange, the documents were available to the tribunal prosecution for use during closed-door sessions of the Milosevic trial.
The head of Serbia's legal team before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Radoslav Stojanovic, explicitly denied the allegations Sunday, describing them as absurd.
He tied them to efforts to question the recent ICJ ruling in BiH's genocide case against Serbia.
The ICJ acquitted Serbia of direct responsibility for the 1995 Srebrenica genocide.

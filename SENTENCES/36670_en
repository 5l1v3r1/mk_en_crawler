DUBLIN, Ireland -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Saturday (1 May) that the road to EU membership remains open to Serbia-Montenegro. 
At the ceremony marking EU enlargement, Solana pointed out that the Union does not have a fixed number of members and that membership is open to all countries which meet its requirements.
On Friday, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said that he intends to launch talks with Serbia about EU membership. 
He said Serbia-Montenegro is the only country in the Western Balkans that is at a standstill in efforts to join the EU.

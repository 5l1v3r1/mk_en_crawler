TIRANA, Albania -- The work of the parliamentary commission for electoral reform has stalled again due to disagreements between the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and the main opposition Socialist Party (SP).
At issue this time is the deadline for posting the preliminary voters' list ahead of local elections this winter.
The DP wants a 25 October deadline, while the SP wants a later deadline.

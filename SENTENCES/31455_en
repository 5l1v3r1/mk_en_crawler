PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A prominent Serb politician was formally charged with leading a violent protest in Mitrovica a year ago which left 20 UN police officers injured.
A UN spokesman said Milan Ivanovic faces up to ten years in prison if convicted.
He went into hiding for several months when UN authorities tried to arrest him, but later surrendered.
Prosecutors first wanted to charge him with attempted murder, but settled for charges of violent behaviour.
In other news, the Serbian government sent a letter Wednesday to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Security Council, accusing UNMIK chief Michael Steiner of helping Kosovo become independent.
Steiner has proposed transferring some UNMIK powers to local institutions.
Belgrade wants basic security requirements for minorities guaranteed first.

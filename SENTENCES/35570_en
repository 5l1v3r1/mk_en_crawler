ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister George Papandreou was unanimously nominated on Friday (6 February) to the post of president of the ruling PASOK party.
Addressing the 4,500 delegates at the extraordinary party congress, Papandreou thanked them for their support and said if PASOK wins the 7 March elections, the new government would be smaller and more efficient than previous ones.
Its major guidelines would be decentralisation, transparency and morality.
He described a new era of politics that does not tolerate social exclusion and xenophobia.

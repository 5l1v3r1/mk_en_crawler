TIRANA, Albania -- The ruling Democratic Party (DP) announced on Thursday (January 3rd) that since the main opposition Socialist Party does not want to co-operate on key judicial and electoral reforms, the majority will seek support from smaller parties in parliament.
DP lawmaker Aleksander Biberaj said the party would begin with the Socialist Movement for Integration before talking to all other small opposition parties.
He added the DP is determined to secure the 84 votes needed to finalise reforms requested by NATO and the EU.

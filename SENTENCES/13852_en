BRUSSELS, Belgium -- In a statement handed out to reporters in Brussels Friday (19 August), the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) announced a one-month halt to its campaign of violence in Turkey. 
"Apart from legitimate self defence against annihilation, it is extremely important that there should be no armed clashes in order for the development of a conflict-free environment," the group said, adding that it was calling on its armed wing to cease attacks.
PKK chairman Zubeyir Aydar was to have made the announcement in person at a news conference on Friday, but the event was cancelled on short notice. 
Turkey had asked Belgian authorities to arrest Aydar, calling him "an outlaw and the head of a terrorist organisation".
Meanwhile, Turkey is preparing a new anti-terrorism law, with several parliamentary committees engaged in the task, NTV reported Thursday. 
The new law would tighten measures in the fight against terrorism and increase punishments for those responsible for propaganda on behalf of terrorist groups. 
It would allow officials to bar those suspected of such activities from certain regions.

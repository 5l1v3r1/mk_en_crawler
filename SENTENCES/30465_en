WASHINGTON, United States -- New York Democrat Eliot Engel and 20 other congressmen have called on President Barack Obama to play a more active role in all stages of talks between Pristina and Belgrade.
They have expressed concern that Serbia's EU integration prior to solving issues with Kosovo would allow Belgrade to block Kosovo's future EU membership, media reported on Thursday (February 17th).
Separately, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement marking the 3rd anniversary of Kosovo's independence, saying that Washington is committed to the future of Kosovo and is honoured to be friends and partners.

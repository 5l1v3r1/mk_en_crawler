SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov dismissed allegations Sunday (1 December) by US Ambassador to Bulgaria James Pardew that organised crime dominates lawfully existing organisations and politicians. 
On Saturday, Pardew levelled his most serious criticism yet on the subject, saying organised crime in Bulgaria is too obvious for relevant authorities to ignore. 
He reiterated that crime has no concrete relationship with democratic practices but they make it more visible.
In other news, the defence ministry says it will hold a rare winter meeting of its military attaches in Sofia later this month, to discuss new foreign policy priorities in light of Bulgaria's invitation to join NATO. 
Such gatherings are usually held in the summer.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Boyko Borissov pledged Sunday (20 April) that security forces would provide evidence on links between politicians and organised crime. 
It will be contained in a report being written jointly by the National Service for Organised Crime Control, the National Security Service and the police. 
The subject will be Friday's attack on a car driving along the Tsarigradsko Chaussee Boulevard. 
The presumed target, the driver, had been investigated for drug trafficking. 
He survived, but a passenger died. 
Borissov said the case was connected to corruption at high levels of power (Trud, 24 Chassa, Dnevnik - 21/04/03; BTA, BNR - 20/04/03)

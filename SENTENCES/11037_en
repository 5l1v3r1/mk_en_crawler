BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbia-Montenegro Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic said Tuesday (29 March) that indicted Serb General Sreten Lukic, who underwent surgery earlier in the day, could leave for The Hague within days.
But Ljajic also indicated that Belgrade wants Lukic to remain in the country until his trial at the UN war crimes tribunal begins.
Ljajic, who is also the chairman of the federal council for co-operation with the tribunal, said Lukic's rate of recovery would determine his departure.
Ljajic also urged another Hague indictee, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, to turn himself in, saying Pavkovic's refusal to surrender was damaging to the interests of the nation.
Pavkovic is also wanted for questioning in Serbia in connection with the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic and the attempted assassination of opposition leader Vuk Draskovic.

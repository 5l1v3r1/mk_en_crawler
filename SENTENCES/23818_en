PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK will keep its legal office operating despite the staff reduction due to the reconfiguration process, local media reported on Sunday (June 21st).
Before the February 2008 declaration of independence, the legal office supervised all laws approved by parliament.
Now, the office will make sure that UNMIK actions are in accordance with UNMIK's mandate.
Officials say each UN mission in the world has such an office.
In light of EULEX's deployment and its responsibility for the rule of law, UNMIK spokesman Russell Geekie said "UNMIK will be more of a political mission ...
much more oriented towards establishing dialogue between communities."
In other news, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that his cabinet plans to recognise Kosovo's independence in August, following consultations with US President Barack Obama.

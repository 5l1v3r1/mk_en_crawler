BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic has sent a letter to NATO seeking formal admission to the Partnership for Peace programme. 
In an announcement Thursday (19 June), he pledged that his country is "ready to contribute in all ways to the realisation of the programmes of the Partnership for Peace and to the reinforcement of security in the region." Svilanovic added that joining would help Serbia-Montenegro continue its democratic reforms, particularly in establishing civilian control over the military. 
In addition, the letter said Serbian-Montenegrin authorities have worked towards meeting their international obligations, war crimes co-operation being the most important.

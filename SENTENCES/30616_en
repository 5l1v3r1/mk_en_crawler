PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The OSCE office in Kosovo criticised local institutions for failing to create adequate conditions for the integration of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian (RAE) communities. 
A report published on Monday (May 9th) by the OSCE mission says that these communities are among the most disadvantaged groups in Kosovo. 
"More tangible action and efforts are needed to foster the three communities' integration in the systems of education and employment, as well as promote their participation and representation in social and public life," said Ambassador Werner Almhofer, head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo.

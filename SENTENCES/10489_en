SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament confirmed the resignation of Prime Minister Hari Kostov and his cabinet at a special session Thursday (18 November).
By law, President Branko Crvenkovski now has ten days to announce a new prime minister, who must then present a list of cabinet members within 20 days.
In other news, Skopje says it has nearly completed the first phase of answering the European Commission's questionnaire.
Relevant institutions have responded to around 98 per cent of the 3,000 questions submitted in October, according to the government.
The document is meant to assess Macedonia's readiness to start official talks on EU membership.

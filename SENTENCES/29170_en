JERUSALEM, Israel -- Authorities on Thursday (August 5th) released a Turkish ship at the centre of the May 31st raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla. 
The Mavi Marmara ship was towed out of the port of Haifa. 
Two other Turkish boats were released from the port of Ashdod. 
Israeli authorities announced last month that the decision to free the vessels was made "to improve relations and restore trust between the two countries". 
The attack, which left nine Turkish activists dead, prompted fierce criticism from around the world and led to a diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey.

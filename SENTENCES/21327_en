THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- In an appeal published on Tuesday (August 26th), former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic requested that The Hague war crimes tribunal annul his trial because of procedural violations, threats and other irregularities. 
He claims that the presumption of innocence has turned into a "farce" because the media have "demonised" his personality. 
"There is not a single person in the world who believes that I could be acquitted," Karadzic said. 
Most of the judges in the tribunal are from NATO member states, he added, noting not one represents a Slavic state. 
His next scheduled court appearance is on Friday.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The cabinet and the military agreed on Sunday (August 8th) about filling key posts in the army amid charges against some of the candidates, suspected of plotting to topple the government. 
General Isik Kosaner was appointed as chief of the general staff, while General Erdal Ceylanoglu is the new commander of land forces. 
General Hayri Kivrikoglu became the 1st Army Corps commander, replacing Hazan Igsiz, who has been called to testify in the so-called Ergenekon case. 
The appointments followed a long and difficult meeting of the Supreme Military Council last week, where the army and the government argued over the nominees. 
On Friday, a court in Istanbul issued a ruling that nullified the 102 arrest warrants issued last month for retired and active duty officers charged with plotting to topple the government.

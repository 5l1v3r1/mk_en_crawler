ANKARA, Turkey -- Supreme Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman YalcÄ±nkaya weighed into the debate about whether women should be allowed to wear headscarves in public institutions, indicating he believes the ban should be preserved. 
In a statement Thursday (January 17th), he said political parties are too focused on the religious aspect of the issue in an attempt to placate various religious and ethnic groups, when it is more a question of human rights and the right of personal choice. 
YalcÄ±nkaya warned that the issue was an example of political parties again trying to undermine the secular and unitary structure of Turkey. 
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged that the ban be lifted.

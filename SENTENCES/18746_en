TIRANA, Albania -- The failure of a power line left the entire country without electricity for two hours early Tuesday (February 6th).
Andi Beli, head of the Albanian Electro-Energy Corporation, said workers made the necessary repairs in record time.
The failed transmission line is used to import electricity from Kosovo.
Beli attributed the problem to differences between the Kosovo and Albanian power grids.
An energy crisis has gripped the country this winter.
Officials are scrambling to boost electricity imports to shorten the length of daily blackouts.

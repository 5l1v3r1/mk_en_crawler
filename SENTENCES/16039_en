TIRANA, Albania -- Gramoz Pashko, the central figure in Albania's anti-communist revolution of 1990, is missing and presumed dead, following a helicopter crash in the Adriatic.
The government said on Monday (17 July) that the helicopter was taking Pashko -- together with his son and four others -- to an Italian hospital when it disappeared some 30km off the Italian coast.
The 50-year-old Albanian revolutionary was in a coma after a diving accident Sunday.
Pashko served as deputy premier and economy minister in 1991, masterminding Albania's transition to capitalism.
After a falling out with then President Sali Berisha, he formed his own political party and was twice elected to parliament.

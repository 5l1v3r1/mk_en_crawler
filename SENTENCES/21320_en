THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Macedonian Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski visited convicted war criminal Johan Tarculovski at the Scheveningen detention facility in The Hague on Tuesday (August 26th).
He is the only Macedonian ever imprisoned by The Hague war crimes tribunal.
The former security official received a 12-year prison sentence in July for his role in the 2001 murder of ethnic Albanians in the village of Ljuboten.
Veljanovski assured him of Macedonia's continuing support in appealing that conviction.

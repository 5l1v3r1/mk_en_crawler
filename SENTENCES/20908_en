SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosniak member Haris Silajdzic assumes the rotating chairmanship of the tripartite presidency on Thursday (March 6th), replacing Croat representative Zeljko Komsic.
Silajdzic will head the presidency, which consists of a Serb, a Bosniak and a Croat member, for the next eight months.
On Wednesday, Silajdzic was quoted by the Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti as saying he expects an apology from Podgorica for war crimes committed by its citizens during the 1990s conflicts.
Such an apology would be good for relations between the two countries, Silajdzic said.
He also described it as a logical step, following Podgorica's apology to Croatia for the participation of Montenegrin troops in the Yugoslav National Army.

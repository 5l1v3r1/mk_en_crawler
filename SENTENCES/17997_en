ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Ten people have been taken into custody in connection with the assassination of Tuncay Seyranlioglu, an independent candidate in Sunday's (July 22nd) general elections.
He was murdered Monday evening after a televised debate.
Police say three of the suspects were in a car at a checkpoint in the Istanbul suburb of Sisli.
Local media reports suggest the shooting had more to do with Seyranlioglu's business activities than any political position.

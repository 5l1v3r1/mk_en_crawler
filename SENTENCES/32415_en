TALINN, Estonia -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson said Monday (24 March) that the Iraq crisis would not derail the Alliance's enlargement process.
Robertson told the seven candidate countries, including Bulgaria and Romania, that they "face a double challenge:
to intensify their political and military efforts, and jump on a moving train." Robertson reassured them that they have been issued tickets already.
"There are no indications that any of the 19 parliaments will fail to ratify the accession because of the current debates (on Iraq)," he said, adding that differences over Iraq have not undermined the role and future of the alliance.

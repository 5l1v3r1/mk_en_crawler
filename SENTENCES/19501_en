ATHENS, Greece -- The main opposition party PASOK filed a no-confidence motion against the government Wednesday (March 26th) over a controversial pension system reform that has triggered a wave of crippling strikes. 
Critics say the measures will cut pension benefits and will increase the retirement age. 
"That's enough," PASOK leader George Papandreou said as he submitted the motion, signed by 50 lawmakers. 
He accused the government of betraying the public trust since its re-election last September. 
The motion forced a delay in Wednesday's scheduled vote on the pension bill.

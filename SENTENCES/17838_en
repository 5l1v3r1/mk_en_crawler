ANKARA, Turkey -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Tuesday (January 23rd) wrapped up a two-day visit to Turkey, where he urged the country to stay on track with EU reforms.
At a joint news conference following talks with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prodi stressed that this year's presidential and parliamentary elections should not slow the reform process.
He also urged Ankara to be more flexible regarding Cyprus.
Late last year, the EU partially froze negotiations with Turkey for failing to open its ports and air space to Greek Cypriot traffic.
On Monday meanwhile, EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels decided to resume procedures for lifting the direct trade embargo on Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, fulfilling a pledge made in 2004.

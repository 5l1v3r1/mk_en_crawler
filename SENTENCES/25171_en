PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Brussels has decided to establish a Human Rights Review Panel for EULEX, the EU's rule of law mission in Kosovo.
The panel will review complaints from anyone who says they were victims of EULEX.
"As a rule of law mission with certain executive functions, a meaningful and transparent accountability mechanism is fundamental," the mission's head, Yves de Kermabon, said on Wednesday (November 25th).
The panel will consist of three international staff members and one supporting secretariat.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Addressing the North Atlantic Council in Brussels Wednesday (10 November), UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen urged NATO "to stay the course" in Kosovo and keep NATO troops at an adequate level there.
According to Jessen-Petersen, the international community must stave off potential security threats in order to achieve its goal of establishing a stable multiethnic society in the province.
Meanwhile, the new UN Police Commissioner in Kosovo, Kai Vittrup, announced that UNMIK plans to deploy more police officers to minority areas.
He stressed the measure was designed to encourage the return of Serbs and other non-Albanians to the province.
Also Wednesday, UN prosecutors met with political leader Ramush Haradinaj, a former senior Kosovo Liberation Army commander, to question him about his role in the 1998-1999 conflict.
He said afterwards that there would be further interviews.
Prosecutors did not comment.

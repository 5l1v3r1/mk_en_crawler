PORTOROZ, Slovenia -- At the annual Central European Initiative (CEI) summit on Friday (26 November), it was decided that Albania will take over the rotating presidency in 2006. 
The participants agreed also that the CEI would be headed by Belarus in 2007 and Bulgaria and 2008. 
The remaining four member countries that have not presided over the organisation -- Moldova, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Ukraine -- will do so after 2008. 
CEI is a forum for political, economic and social co-operation aimed at bringing the countries closer to the EU.
In other news, Croatia was admitted to the Organisation of Francophone Countries as a member with observer status. 
Croatian Ambassador to Paris Bozidar Gagro said this would open new possibilities for co-operation with the Francophone countries.

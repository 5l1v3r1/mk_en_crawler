SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The deputy leader of the junior government partner Democratic Union for Integration, Teuta Arifi, has called for boycotting a planned referendum on Macedonia's new decentralisation laws.
Press reports Monday (6 September) quote her as telling the Albanian language edition of VOA that the referendum would "hinder the realisation of the Ohrid Peace Accords".
At the same time, she said the vote -- scheduled for 7 November -- could present an opportunity for Macedonians to clarify whether they support integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.

NEW YORK, United States -- The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged France on Friday (August 27th) to avoid the collective deportation of Roma to Romania and "strive for lasting solutions" instead.
The committee expressed concern about "political speeches of discriminatory nature in France".
Reacting to the call, the French government said it was "scrupulously respecting European laws".
The statement came amid France's recent initiative to destroy Roma camps on its territory and deport residents illegally living in the country back to their homelands -- Romania and Bulgaria.

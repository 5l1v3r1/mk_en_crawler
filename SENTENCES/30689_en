SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US embassy has rejected a call by Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Zlatko Lagumdzija to hold a conference on BiH, similar to the Dayton one. 
He made the suggestion during his recent visit to Washington. 
In a statement Wednesday (April 6th), the embassy said no such preparations are being made and that the consent of all three constituent peoples would be required for such an initiative. 
Both key Serb and Croat politicians have rejected Lagumdzija's proposal. 
Following the October 3rd elections, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been without a regular government for six months, while the legal status of the newly elected cabinet is still unclear. 
BiH also still lacks a new state-level cabinet.

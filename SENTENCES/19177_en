VIENNA, Austria -- Partitioning Kosovo was not discussed during negotiations in Vienna on Thursday (August 30th), according to Wolfgang Ischinger, the EU's envoy for Kosovo status talks. 
The Contact Group's troika -- comprised of the EU, United States and Russia -- held separate sessions with the Serbian and Kosovo Albanian negotiation teams. 
The next meeting will likely take place during the UN General Assembly session in New York next month, and may involve direct talks.
Russian envoy Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko said Thursday's meeting ended without any breakthrough. 
Kosovo Albanians insisted on independence and the Serbs proposed broad autonomy for the province. 
However, both sides did agree to refrain from any action that might derail the current round of negotiations, slated to end on December 10th.

VIENNA, Austria -- BiH's peace, security, prosperity and statehood are best guaranteed by the EU integration process, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Thursday (June 5th) in a speech to the Permanent Council of the OSCE.
"Despite persistent and fundamental differences among the constituent peoples over Bosnia and Herzegovina's history, the current status and future constitutional structure, prospects for achieving a self-sustaining peace based on viable statehood and Euro-Atlantic integration are steadily improving," Lajcak said.
He added that after two years of political deadlock and crisis, it is now extremely important to keep the EU integration process at the top of the political agenda.
BiH is due to sign its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on June 16th.

REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- NATO's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution Tuesday (October 9th) calling on all member nations to invite Albania, Croatia and Macedonia to join the Alliance at the Bucharest Summit in April 2008.
The resolution, adopted at a session in Iceland's capital, also encourages the three countries to step up efforts to implement necessary reforms, saying membership would boost security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic zone.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Opposition New Serbia (NS) party leader Velimir Ilic was attacked in downtown Belgrade on Friday (February 5th) and suffered a slight head injury.
The man who allegedly assaulted him was arrested immediately and had to be protected by police from an angry mob of Ilic supporters.
It happened during an NS rally at which signatures were collected calling for early parliamentary elections.
Right after the attack, Ilic demanded an investigation and the resignation of Interior Minister Ivica Dacic.
All political parties have condemned the assault.

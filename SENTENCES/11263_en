BUCHAREST, Romania -- Finance ministry representatives and an IMF team agreed Thursday (23 June) on new macroeconomic targets for 2005. 
The agreement provides for slightly higher than projected budget and current account deficits, as well as reduced contributions to unemployment, healthcare and pension funds. 
Four months from now, the IMF team will draft an assessment of the implementation of the current stand-by agreement and will review the 2006 draft budget proposal.

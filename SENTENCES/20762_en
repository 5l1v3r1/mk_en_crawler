THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The leader of Serbia's biggest political party goes on trial at The Hague on Wednesday (November 7th) after repeated delays in the case.
Vojislav Seselj is charged with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes.
Prosecutors contend that his hate speeches helped unleash the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
Referring to Seselj as the "chief propagandist of Greater Serbia", prosecutors say he was part of a criminal enterprise to impose Belgrade's domination over the region, with Slobodan Milosevic and others.
The defendant, who has remained chairman of the Radical Party even behind bars, denies participating in any crimes.
He staged a hunger strike months ago to force the tribunal to allow him to act as his own counsel in the trial.
He and his party openly question the fairness of the proceedings against him.

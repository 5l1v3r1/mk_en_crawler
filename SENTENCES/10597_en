THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN war crimes tribunal agreed on Friday (10 September) to let Slobodan Milosevic's two British lawyers appeal their appointment. 
The three judges hearing the case of the former Yugoslav president have given the lawyers seven days to file their motion with an appeals panel. 
The judges agreed that their decision to appoint lawyers for the defendant "affects fundamentally the conduct of the case" and should be decided by an appellate tribunal immediately rather than at the end of the trial. 
The proceedings are due to resume on Tuesday with the appearance of the third witness for the defence. 
Lawyers Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins say their new roles have prompted several of Milosevic's proposed witnesses to refuse to testify.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown will arrive in Geneva on Monday (21 July) for talks with Assistant UN High Commissioner for Refugees Kamel Morjane. 
Ashdown is to present a 2004 action plan for the refugee return process in BiH that transfers responsibility for the process to BiH authorities. 
The document stipulates that international agencies in BiH would continue working with domestic institutions to guarantee sufficient technical and financial capabilities. 
According to estimates from the BiH government, the country needs 460m euros for reconstruction of war-damaged houses. 
Currently, only 51m euros are earmarked annually in the state budget for return issues.
In other news, BiH Minister for Human Rights and Refugees Mirsad Kebo is expected to visit Croatia this week. 
He is to discuss issues stemming from the return to Croatia of at least 30,000 Serb refugees currently on BiH territory, as well as Bosnian Croatian refugees returning from Croatia to BiH.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The ruling Social Democratic Party's (PSD) National Council has reportedly expelled from the party four members of parliament who accused their colleagues of corruption. 
Mediafax reports that the council has begun evaluating every PSD leader and public officer, requiring that by 30 November the party's central bodies punish and replace all those found to have tarnished the party's image. 
On 11 October, the party's permanent delegation passed a vote of confidence in support of PSD Deputy Chairman and Senate Chairman Nicolae Vacaroiu, who was recently accused of corruption by the daily Romania Libera.

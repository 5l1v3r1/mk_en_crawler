PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- In statements Sunday (3 July), the two top leaders in Kosovo have denounced those responsible for bomb attacks on UNMIK, the OSCE, and parliament. 
President Ibrahim Rugova said the blasts late Saturday were aimed at destabilising the province as international officials are reviewing its progress in meeting international democracy standards. 
He accused enemies of Kosovo's potential independence of carrying out the attacks. 
Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi also linked the blasts to the international review that would lead to talks on Kosovo's final status. 
Philip Goldberg, head of the US office in Pristina, said terrorist acts would not divert attention from the important work that lays ahead for the international community and the people of Kosovo. 
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen issued a statement asking the public to provide information to UNMIK and Kosovo police and help bring the perpetrators to justice. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

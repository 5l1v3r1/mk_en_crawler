BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) has confirmed that Croatia has met all benchmarks needed to close the fisheries chapter in its EU talks, Croatian media reported on Wednesday (May 11th).
The EC has forwarded to the Council of the EU a draft joint negotiation position on the chapter which must be adopted before the chapter is formally closed.
This would leave four more chapters open in Croatia's EU accession talks.
The two most problematic -- on justice and competition -- remain open.

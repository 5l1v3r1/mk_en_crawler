SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Branislav Dukic, head of the Association of Bosnian Serb War Victims, confirmed media reports on Wednesday (March 12th) that his group is planning to build a giant cross on Trebevic hill to commemorate Serb victims of the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. 
"The initiative came from the families of fallen soldiers and civilians," Dukic told the Associated Press. 
"The monument will be lighted at night so that it can be seen 24 hours a day," he added. 
The plans have outraged Muslim-dominated Sarajevo. 
Residents say the monument would be an insult to the thousands of people who died in the conflict, especially Bosnian Muslims.

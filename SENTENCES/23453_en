MOSCOW, Russia -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev wrapped up a visit to Moscow on Tuesday (April 28th) amid word that the two governments had hammered out a deal on the long-delayed South Stream project.
Gazprom and Bulgargaz, Bulgaria's state-owned natural gas company, will sign an official agreement within two weeks.
Russia agreed to drop demands to use part of the existing natural gas network in Bulgaria amid opposition by Sofia to giving up any stake in its pipelines.
Gazprom will own a 50% stake in the new pipeline, to be built under the Black Sea and around Ukraine.
Russia also committed to maintain transited natural gas volumes through Bulgarian territory, guaranteeing transit fees.
In other news, Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov decided on Tuesday to schedule the general elections for July 5th.
He had opposed recent amendments to the electoral system that in part raised the thresholds that coalitions and individual parties must meet.
Bulgaria holds elections for European Parliament members on June 7th.

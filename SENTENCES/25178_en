TIRANA, Albania -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini and Slovenian counterpart Samuel Zbogar have sent a letter to the EU asking members to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), local media reported on Wednesday (November 25th). 
Both countries failed to issue biometric passports and ensure full border control, which left them outside the current visa liberalisation plan for the Western Balkans. 
Instead, only citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro will enjoy visa-free travel next year as a reward for meeting standards set by Brussels.

LUXEMBOURG -- EU officials expect EULEX to take concrete steps in the fight against organised crime and corruption in Kosovo and to strengthen the mission's presence in the country's Serb-dominated north. 
Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxemburg on Monday (April 26th), it was announced that EULEX is expected to launch specific cases against high-level organised crime and corruption. 
At the same time, the ministers noted EULEX's important results achieved in a difficult environment, as it assists local judicial and law enforcement agencies. 
EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon visits Brussels on Tuesday, to brief a European Parliament subcommittee.

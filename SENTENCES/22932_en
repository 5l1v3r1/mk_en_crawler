NEW YORK, United States -- UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz has invited Greek representative Adamantios Vassilakis and Macedonian counterpart Nikola Dimitrov to hold a new round of talks on the long-standing name dispute between the two countries. 
Vassilakis and Dimitrov will meet Nimetz on August 14th and August 15th in New York, according to media reports Monday (August 4th). 
UN sources said Nimetz does not intend to hold talks on the so-called Macedonian minority issue, despite a request from Skopje.

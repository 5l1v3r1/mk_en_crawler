ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey must speed up implementation of democratic reforms, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn told Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul on Sunday (6 March), saying the process is currently in a lull.
Rehn singled out the eradication of torture and protecting the rights of women and religious minorities as areas where much work remains to be done.
He also announced that Turkey has confirmed it will sign a customs protocol with the EU that would extend a current agreement to the Union's new members, including Cyprus.
On Monday, Rehn and Gul meet with Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.

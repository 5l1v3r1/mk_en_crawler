SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) says victories in the upcoming elections for European Parliament (EP) members and in the next Bulgarian municipal elections are its priorities in 2007.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, leader of the BSP, discussed the issue on Monday (November 27th) when the party's high council convened in Sofia.
The BSP does not want the elections for EP deputies and mayors and municipal councillors in Bulgaria to be held simultaneously.
Stanishev also suggested that the ultranationalist Attack coalition and a party being formed by popular Sofia Mayor Boyko Borissov must be viewed as serious political rivals.

ANKARA, Turkey -- The body of a Turkish prisoner who died in a Belgian prison was returned home for burial Wednesday (August 12th). 
Mikail Tekin, 31, died at the Jamioulx prison near Charleroi in southern Belgium under circumstances suggesting he may have been tortured and beaten by prison guards. 
His death spurred a wave of protest among Turkish media who accused Belgium of using "torture methods" against its prisoners. 
Belgian authorities are investigating the death.

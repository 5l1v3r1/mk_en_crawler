SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian court on Friday (November 3rd) sentenced two Serbs for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict. 
In the longest such sentence ever issued by the BiH judiciary, defendant Marko Samardzija received a 26-year sentence for the 1992 torture and murder of Muslims in the town of Kljuc. 
He commanded a Serb unit at the time.
Nikola Kovacevic, 38, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in a separate trial. 
He was found guilty of transporting Muslims and others to concentration camps in the Sanski Most area at the beginning of the conflict in 1992. 
Prosecutors say they will seek a harsher sentence for him.
Also Friday, the BiH Court announced that the war crimes trial against former Republika Srpska justice and interior minister Momcilo Mandic would begin on Monday. 
The former close ally of fugitive Radovan Karadzic is accused in relation to the April 1992 attack on Sarajevo, and of establishing detention camps in Ilidza and Foca. 
Separately, Mandic was convicted of financial crimes last week.

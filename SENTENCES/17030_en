PODGORICA, Montenegro -- President Filip Vujanovic signed into law Thursday (November 2nd) a measure that launches preparations for a new constitution. 
It would first require approval by two-thirds of parliament members. 
Failing that, a referendum on the constitution would be organised.
Also Thursday, Podgorica hosted a round table on the future constitution, aimed at providing guidelines on principles related to human rights and democracy. 
A number of politicians and legal experts took part in the debate.
In other news, the Vijesti newspaper reported on Friday on the composition of Prime Minister-designate Zeljko Sturanovic's new cabinet, which will be unveiled next week. 
Vijesti says Milan Rocen is the likely new foreign minister, Boro Vucinic would be defence minister, and Miras Radovic would serve as justice minister.

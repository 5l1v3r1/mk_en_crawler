BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Acting Serbian President Natasa Micic announced Wednesday (23 July) that presidential elections would take place in the autumn, though the exact date would depend largely on the adoption of the new Serbian Constitution. 
Parliamentary commissions are still working on a draft.
Meanwhile, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic is in Washington to discuss a range of foreign, domestic and economic policy issues.
In other news, a ranking security official from Slobodan Milosevic's regime suspected of involvement in the murders of the ex-president's opponents has been released from jail, his lawyer said Thursday. 
Milorad Bracanovic, a former deputy chief of Milosevic's secret service and a member of a notorious paramilitary group, was picked up during the sweep that followed the March assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. 
Bracanovic was detained for four months.

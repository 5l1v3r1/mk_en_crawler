BELGRADE, Serbia -- Lawmakers on Thursday (July 17th) again failed to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, as well as an energy agreement with Russia and the cabinet's resolution on Kosovo.
Various procedural moves launched by the opposition blocked much of the session.
A major issue was the proposal by the ruling coalition to discuss the SAA and the Kosovo resolution together, given their close relationship, according to members of the ruling Democratic Party (DS).
Opposition parties balked and did their best to delay the procedure.
The session resumes on Friday.
Also Thursday, Sasa Vukadinovic was named new director of the national security service following the resignation of Rade Bulatovic.
Vukadinovic has considerable experience in law enforcement and was part of Operation Sabre, launched after the March 2003 murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- An explosion at a wood processing plant in the northern town of Gheorgheni injured 23 people, several seriously, on Saturday (July 26th). 
Investigators think a spark ignited sawdust, which, at a certain temperature and humidity level, can react as gunpowder.
In other news, flooding in parts of northern Romania has killed at least four people. 
Hardest hit is Suceava County. 
Massive rains have rivers rising, forcing evacuations.

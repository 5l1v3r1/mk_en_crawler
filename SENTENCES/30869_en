SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The ruling GERB party submitted a draft decision to parliament Thursday (May 5th) that would schedule the presidential elections on October 23rd, a date GERB has suggested for a while now.
According to the elections code, the presidential and municipal elections should be held simultaneously.
This is problematic since parliament has the right to set the date for presidential elections while the president is constitutionally authorised to decide on the local elections date.
GERB's proposal would either force the president to agree or prompt a challenge of the election code before the Constitutional Court for limiting the president's constitutional rights.

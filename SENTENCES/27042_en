ANKARA, Turkey -- Speaking to a group of European policy and decision-makers meeting in northern Austria on Wednesday (September 2nd), Minister of EU Affairs Egemen Bagis, Turkey's chief negotiator with the EU, said Ankara is holding fast to its quest for EU membership. 
Bagis emphasised that negotiations are going slower than expected mostly due to political rather than technical reasons. 
In that sense, he said, the government is only seeking fair treatment from EU members, adding that membership would be a "win-win" situation. 
Stressing the increasing demographic, economic and strategic importance of his country, Bagis told the audience that the EU needs Turkey as a member.

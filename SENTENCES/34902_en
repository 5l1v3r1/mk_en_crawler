PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- People who regard themselves as Montenegrins are a minority in their own republic, according to results of a census released Friday (19 December).
Of a total population of 672,656, 40.6 per cent said they were ethnic Montenegrins.
That's a decline of 30 per cent since the last census, in 1991.
An estimated 30 per cent described themselves as Serbs, 9.4 per cent as Bosnians, 4.3 per cent as Albanians, one per cent as Muslims, and 0.4 per cent as Croats.
Nearly 70 per cent said they were Orthodox Christian, compared to 20.9 per cent Muslim, and 4.2 per cent Roman Catholic.

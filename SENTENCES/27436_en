BELGRADE, Serbia -- New Serbia (NS) leader Velimir Ilic announced on Thursday (October 28th) that his party will form a pre-election coalition with the largest opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).
In an interview with Beta news agency, Ilic explained the move was prompted by the need for a strong alternative to the current government, which, he says, has failed to bring the economy out of crisis and defend Serbia's vital national interests.
Ilic called on former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia to join the coalition as well, and help formulate a comprehensive programme to gain broad public support.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The government has approved amendments to the law on preventing sports violence, with the goal of clamping down on hooliganism.
The decision, made at the government session on Friday (January 7th), was prompted by recent violent incidents during football matches.
One of the most serious happened last May during match between Dinamo (Zagreb) and Hajduk (Split) when a police officer lost his eye in riots between supporters of the two traditional football rivals.
The amendments prohibit fans from wearing masks and being intoxicated.
They also ban the sale of alcohol at sports facilities, and stipulate penalties for Croats who commit acts of hooliganism at sporting events abroad.

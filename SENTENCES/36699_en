TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities are tightening security at the airport in Tirana in advance of next month's Olympics in neighbouring Greece, a senior official announced Wednesday (28 July). 
"Starting Sunday, special police forces will be deployed at Rinas Airport to reinforce control at the customs, luggage and documents checkpoints of all passengers crossing the Albanian border," said Transport Minister Spartak Poci. 
He added that monitoring Albanian airspace would be bolstered as well. 
The announcements came after senior police and army officials met earlier Wednesday to discuss enhanced security measures.

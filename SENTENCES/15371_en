ZAGREB, Croatia -- If a referendum were held today, more than 50 per cent of Croatian citizens would support their country's membership in the EU, according to a new poll published in the Zagreb daily Vecernji List.
That is up since last month, when around 47 per cent of respondents said they support EU accession.
Not since October 2005, just after the opening of accession negotiations, have poll numbers been this high.

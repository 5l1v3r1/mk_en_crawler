ANKARA, Turkey -- About 10,000 people gathered in a central Istanbul square on Sunday (July 12th) to protest ethnic violence in China's Xinjiang province. 
The demonstration was organised by the Islamic Felicity Party. 
Protesters shouted slogans denouncing recent violence against the Uighur Muslim minority in China that has claimed more than 180 lives. 
They accused the international community of turning a blind eye to events in China, and called on the Turkish government to intervene to protect Uighurs.
On Friday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the violence can only be described as "a form of genocide". 
"It is unbelievable. 
On the one hand, we talk about universal human rights, but on the other hand, we have to witness something like this," he said. 
He vowed to insist that the issue be brought up at the UN Security Council.
The foreign ministry, however, said Ankara has no intention of intervening in China's internal affairs.

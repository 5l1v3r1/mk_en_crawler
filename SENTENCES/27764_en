ANKARA, Turkey -- The government suspended on Wednesday (November 24th) three high-ranking military officers pending the result of a trial over their alleged involvement in a plot to topple the government of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
The two major generals -- Halil Helvacioglu and Gurbuz Kaya -- and rear admiral Abdullah Gavramoglu are among a group of almost 200 retired and active duty officers who will go on trial in December in relation to an alleged plot in 2003 to create chaos and trigger a military coup.

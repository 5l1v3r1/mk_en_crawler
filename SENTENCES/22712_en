TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is close to building its first nuclear power station. 
At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday (July 9th), Prime Minister Sali Berisha asked Finance Minister Ridvan Bode to follow the procedures that would enable the country to use nuclear energy. 
"The [G-8] discussed the issue, and there is no reason why Albania cannot build one of the planned 1,000 plants," Berisha said.

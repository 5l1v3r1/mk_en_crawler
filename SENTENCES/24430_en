SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU reiterated its concern over political tensions in BiH and the slow pace of reforms during a visit by the foreign ministers of past, current and future EU presidency countries on Wednesday (April 8th).
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, who takes over the rotating EU presidency in July, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg told members of the BiH presidency that the country already lags behind the others in the Western Balkans.
They urged the entity- and state-level parliaments and governments to accelerate the reform process and meet obligations stemming from the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed with the EU last June.
They also said the European Commission will consider easing the visa regime for countries in the Western Balkans towards the end of the year, but only after BiH implements necessary security and other reforms.
In other news, BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric dismissed on Tuesday Deputy Defence Minister Igor Crnadak and Deputy Transport Minister Veselin Poljasevic, both from the Party of Democratic Prosperity (PDP).
The move followed a request by the PDP, which decided in February to leave Republika Srpska's ruling coalition and pull its representatives out of the state-level government.
The parliament must now confirm the dismissals.

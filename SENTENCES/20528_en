BELGRADE, Serbia -- Belgrade will "strongly back" Kosovo Serbs in case the province declares independence, but will not send troops there, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic told the Vienna-based daily Die Presse on Thursday (October 11th). 
Samardzic explained that Serbia will keep its army out of the dispute, but that the Serbian government would demand the establishment of Serb institutions in Kosovo to protect the Serb population.

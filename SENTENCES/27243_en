TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who heads the Democratic Party, announced on Monday (August 31st) that the new coalition with the Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) will last well into the future, until 2021.
Now that the DP's victory in the June 28th elections has been declared official, Berisha is expected to finalise an agreement this week on positions in the new government, which include four lawmakers from the SMI, one member of the Republican Party, and one from the new Party for Justice and Integration.
Berisha rejected criticism from opposition leader Edi Rama, who insists the election results were manipulated.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Anti-terror police released five people on Monday (March 9th) detained for allegedly planning an attack against Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.
The police stated that the suspects obtained their release after questioning by a prosecutor.
However, the prosecutor ordered the admission of one female detainee, believed to have psychological problems, to a local mental hospital.
Police arrested the five in the southern province of Adana on Saturday over an alleged plot to assassinate Erdogan, who was attending a campaign rally there.

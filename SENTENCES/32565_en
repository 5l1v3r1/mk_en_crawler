BUCHAREST, Romania -- A survey by the Open Society Foundation finds 75 per cent of all farmers would vote in favour of EU entry, should a referendum be held. 
The Rural Eurobarometer was conducted in December. 
Respondents believe EU membership would contribute to the agriculture sector in many ways, including increased investments and better access to export markets. 
However, 44 per cent said the sector does not yet meet EU standards.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The defence ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey, Moldova, and the Ukraine, and delegates from Italy and the United States are meeting in Zagreb Wednesday (19 November) for the 8th annual forum of the Southeast Europe Defence Ministerial (SEDM) process.
Among other things, discussions will focus on the state of military co-operation in the region and the operational readiness of the Southeastern Europe Brigade to officially participate in peacekeeping operations.
Before the forum began, representatives of the Croatian and Macedonian governments sealed an agreement regulating bilateral military co-operation in 2004.
In other news, Zagreb has asked Norway to extradite Croatian Serb Milan Gojkovic, who was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison for war crimes.
Norwegian authorities arrested him in late September, on the basis of an international warrant issued by Croatia in 1997.

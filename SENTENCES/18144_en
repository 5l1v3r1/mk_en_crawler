JERUSALEM, Israel -- Minister of Infrastructure Binyamin Ben Eliezer met with Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler in Jerusalem on Thursday (December 14th), where they discussed the potential for establishing a new "energy corridor" that would carry Baku oil to Israel via a Ceyhan pipeline.
The oil could later be shipped by Israeli tankers to India, China, Japan and other Far Eastern countries.
The ministers agreed that later, pipelines to transport water and natural gas and an electricity power line between the two countries could be built.
Realisation of the project would begin immediately, with a feasibility study prepared within next six months.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and his Montenegrin counterpart, Milo Djukanovic, met on Wednesday (6 April) and adjusted their stances about how the Serbia-Montenegro Constitutional Charter could be amended, according to the state-run Tanjug news agency.
The news that the two republics are closer to an agreement on the future of the state union preceded EU security chief Javier Solana's visit to Belgrade Thursday.
Also Wednesday, former Serbian police general Sreten Lukic made his first appearance before The Hague tribunal, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity in connection with the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict.
He postponed entering a plea.
Lukic, who was transferred to The Hague earlier this week, next appears before the tribunal on 4 May.

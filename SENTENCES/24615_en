ATHENS, Greece -- Opposition parties rejected on Thursday (March 5th) an appeal by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis to reach the political consensus needed to blunt the impact of the global economic crisis. 
Karamanlis met with leaders of the opposition parties in an effort to reach common ground on anti-crisis measures. 
However, PASOK (the main opposition party), the Communist Party of Greece and the Radical Left Coalition said they disagreed with the government's proposals. 
PASOK leader George Papandreou in fact called again for early elections, saying the government's policies were "ineffective, unreliable and fruitless".

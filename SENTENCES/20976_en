ROME, Italy -- Italy has began deporting Romanians with criminal records, authorities announced on Saturday (November 3rd), in response to last week's murder of a 47-year-old woman.
On Wednesday, the Italian government adopted a decree authorising police to expel EU nationals who pose a security risk.
The first three Romanians with criminal records were put on a plane to Bucharest on Friday night.
Tuesday's murder provoked a backlash against Romanians in Italy.
A dozen masked men attacked three Romanians in a Rome suburb, injuring one of them seriously.
That prompted Interior Minister Giuliano Amato to condemn xenophobia and racial hatred.
According to some estimates, more than 500,000 Romanians now live in Italy.

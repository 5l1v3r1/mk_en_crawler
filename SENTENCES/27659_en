MADRID, Spain -- The interior ministry announced on Thursday (August 26th) that Serbian war crimes suspect Veselin Vlahovic has been extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
Vlahovic, 41, known as the Monster of Grbavica, was detained in early March in Spain, where he moved after escaping a Montenegrin prison in 2001. 
He is accused of murder, rape and the torture of non-Serbs while a member of a paramilitary unit from 1992 to 1993.

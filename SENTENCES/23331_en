TIRANA, Albania -- Posters calling for dismissal of ethnic Greek Vasil Bollano, mayor of the southern town of Himara, appeared in Gjirokastra early on Thursday (December 25th). 
The posters urged residents to oppose Bollano's attempts to "detach" the Himara region from Albania. 
Bollano has urged Greece not to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Albania unless Tirana grants full property rights to the ethnic Greek minority living in the Himara region. 
Many Albanians perceive it as a first step towards seeking autonomy for the region.

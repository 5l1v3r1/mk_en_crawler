ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday (March 8th) denied allegations that journalists are being arrested because of their work.
"Which journalist has been arrested just because he criticised the government?
Which journalist has been arrested due to press activity?" Erdogan asked a meeting of the parliamentary group of his Justice and Development Party.
His statement followed the arrests last week of about ten journalists, as part of the so-called Ergenekon investigation into a suspected plot to topple the government.
The arrests spurred reactions from the EU, the US and international human rights organisations, who expressed concern about the state of media freedom in Turkey.

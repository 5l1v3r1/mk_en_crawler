THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the UN war crimes tribunal rejected on Tuesday (September 22nd) an appeal by judges to trim the indictment against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, insisting it would mean dropping key charges against him.
Karadzic is charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"The prosecution cannot ...
complete its case within a calendar year without sacrificing a core component of its case," the prosecutors said.
Hague tribunal judges have urged the indictment be amended to speed up the trial, a stance that angered Bosnian Muslims.

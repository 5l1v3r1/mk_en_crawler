SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prosecutors filed corruption charges Thursday (March 4th) against former Defence Minister Nikolay Tsonev for allegedly signing contracts that cost the state millions. 
According to the indictment, Bulgaria overpaid for goods by about 4m euros. 
Tsonev is the second minister to be indicted from the former Bulgarian Socialist Party government, which lost to the Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria in general elections in 2009. 
Last week, ex-Labour and Welfare Minister Emilia Maslarova was charged with misappropriating 5.5m euros in state funds.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- SFOR Commander Ben Barry told reporters Wednesday (10 September) that peacekeepers have found several large weapons caches in Republika Srpska. 
Barry said the hand grenades, rockets, mortar shells, cannons and anti-aircraft weapons date back to the 1992-1995 war.
In other news, forensic experts say they have so far recovered 400 bodies from a mass grave near the town of Zvornik. 
Evidence suggests that some of the victims were Muslim civilians from Vlasenica, Bratunac and Zvornik.

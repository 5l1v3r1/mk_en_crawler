BELGRADE, Serbia -- European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele visit Belgrade on Thursday (May 19th) where they are expected to voice support for Serbia's EU bid and reform process in meetings with President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic and Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic Dejanovic.
Fuele and Barroso head next to Kosovo.
Barroso was scheduled to visit Albania after Kosovo, but cancelled the trip due to the political situation in Tirana surrounding the recent elections.

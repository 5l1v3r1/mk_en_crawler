SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski said on Monday (December 25th) that there would be more personnel changes in the Army and in the intelligence services, as a result of a recent scandal involving illegal weapons exports. 
Local media reports suggest that three high-ranking officers from the military intelligence, logistics and defence sector civil services have been fired. 
The weapons involved appear to have been donated by the United States and were being sold in Bulgaria.
In other news Monday, the union representing defence sector employees presented its demands for an 18% hike in army salaries. 
The union also protested plans to lay-off some 113 officers, insisting on equal treatment for military and civilian personnel in the army.

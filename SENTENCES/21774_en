ANKARA, Turkey -- Representatives of the European Parliament (EP) on Monday (November 24th) called on Turkey's pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) to distance itself from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
Hannes Swoboda, vice-chairman of the EP's committee on foreign affairs, warned DTP lawmakers they should make a clear distinction between the Kurdish issue and terrorism and keep their distance from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
The EP delegation discussed the matter with parliament's foreign affairs committee in Ankara.
In other news Monday, two PKK militants died in clashes with Turkish security forces in the eastern province of Agri, media reported. 
The skirmishes erupted in a rural area where a major died and four other Turkish soldiers suffered injuries last week.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini met with President Boris Tadic on Tuesday (April 27th) to begin a two-day visit to Belgrade.
Ahead of the trip, Frattini told the daily Blic that he is convinced Serbia will receive formal EU candidate status by mid-2011 at the latest.
He said Italian diplomats are working to unblock the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, a key precondition to candidate status.
Frattini also reiterated the EU's expectation that both Serbia and Kosovo will attend a June summit in Sarajevo, at which the bloc will confirm the region's EU prospects.
Tadic declined to attend a summit meeting of regional leaders last month, due to Kosovo's attendance.

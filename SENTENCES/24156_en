SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Republika Srpska (RS) parliament resolution was released Monday (June 15th) in the Official Gazette. 
The resolution obliges RS's institutions and officials to oppose any future transfer of power to BiH. 
High Representative Valentin Inzko has urged Bosnian Serbs to withdraw the resolution, saying it violates both the Dayton Peace Agreement and BiH's constitution.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- Kosovo got a new penal code as of Tuesday (6 April). 
The Criminal Code and Criminal Proceedings Act, approved by former UNMIK head Michael Steiner, annuls the Serbian criminal legislation previously used in the province. 
The act brings the province in line with international and European law standards. 
Belgrade has criticised the move.
In other news, a NATO official insisted Tuesday that KFOR has no intention of pulling out of Kosovo unless stability is achieved. 
Marco Minniti, a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly subcommittee for central and Eastern Europe, made the promise in a speech to the Serbian Parliament. 
He was responding to remarks by Belgrade's co-ordinator on Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, who said last month's violence discredited NATO's authority in the province.

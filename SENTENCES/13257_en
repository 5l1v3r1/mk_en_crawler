VIENNA, Austria -- Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, urged Turkey on Tuesday (21 February) to recognise Cyprus by the end of this year.
Schuessel also voiced Austria's expectations that Turkey would finally open its air space and ports to Greek Cypriot planes and ships by the same deadline.
His remarks followed a meeting in Vienna with Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos.

PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Leaders of Serb parallel structures in the north are threating to quit all co-operation with Kosovo Police and EULEX. 
Media reported on a meeting Monday (January 17th) among the Serb mayors, representatives of the Serbian Interior Ministry and civil protection representative to discuss Pristina's decision to seize Serbian vehicle plates and suspend the commander of Zvecan police station, Nenad Djuric. 
The mayor of Mitrovice/Mitrovica from the parallel structures, Krstimir Pantic, says recent acts pose a serious threat to the situation. 
"We appealed to the international community and especially EULEX to immediately annul the decision of Bajram Rexhepi, Kosovo interior minister. 
We expect EULEX to react immediately and fulfil its mandate, otherwise, the Municipality of Mitrovice/Mitrovica will terminate every contact with this mission," Pantic said.

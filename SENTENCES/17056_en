SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Bosnian Muslim community has launched an effort to rebuild a historic mosque in Banja Luka, the capital of Republika Srpska.
The Ferhard Pasha Mosque was built in 1579 and survived intact until 1993 when it was badly damaged by an explosion set off by Serb troops.
The minarets and other parts of the building have been found near the city.
The entire project is assessed at around 8m euros.
Ferhard Pasha was once on UNESCO's world heritage list.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A new poll published Thursday (1 September) finds 56 per cent of Romanians predict EU accession will bring more disadvantages than advantages in the short term.
The survey, conducted at the request of the European Commission's delegation in Romania, found only 29 per cent of respondents expect advantages to outweigh disadvantages in the short term.
As regards the long term, Romanians remain optimistic about the benefits of membership, saying it could bring an economic rebound, better laws and an improved political climate, as well as free movement on EU territory.

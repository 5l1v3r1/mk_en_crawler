TIRANA, Albania -- The two main political parties -- the ruling Socialists and the opposition Democrats -- signed an agreement Thursday (14 October) on changes to the bipartisan electoral commission. 
The changes in composition will be included in a bill to be submitted to parliament. 
The agreement was reached after prolonged talks between the two main parties. 
The deadlock had halted the election reform process, ahead of the 2005 elections.

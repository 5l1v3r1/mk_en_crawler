TIRANA, Albania -- The May 8th local elections sets up a scenario in which municipalities and town halls across Albania will feature mayors of one party facing municipal councils dominated by their rivals. 
The Central Election Commission (CEC) published preliminary results for municipal councils Wednesday (May 11th), putting the ruling Democratic Party (DP) coalition ahead of the main opposition Socialist Party's (SP) one. 
The effect is that many municipalities won by the SP-led coalition will have DP-led municipal councils.
In other news, local media is reporting that former deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta will soon be accused of corruption by the High Court. 
The leader of Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI), a junior government party, was caught on tape by a former minister ordering a tender contract, cancelling another one and illegally hiring a party supporter. 
Meta says the video is a set-up produced to harm his reputation.

TIRANA, Albania -- Interior Minister Lulzim Basha praised the police Tuesday (September 7th) for contributing to efforts to get the visa regime with EU countries removed.
The process has hinged on the performance and achievements of the police, Basha told a meeting in Tirana, organised by Belgium, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Basha noted that Albania's progress has been praised by international partners, especially after implementing EU projects for integrated border management and fighting organised crime.

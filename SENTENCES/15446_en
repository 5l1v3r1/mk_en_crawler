PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian President Boris Tadic and his Montenegrin counterpart, Filip Vujanovic, on Saturday (27 May) pledged that their countries would maintain close ties after they become fully independent states.
"Serbia is a democratic country ...
we may have different positions, but we respect democratic principles," said Tadic.
Vujanovic said the two countries would remain friendly and open to each other.
Tadic also met with the union's outgoing President Svetozar Marovic.
They agreed that the governments of Serbia and Montenegro should begin the separation process as soon as the results of the 21 May referendum are confirmed.
Investigators are still looking into alleged irregularities submitted by pro-unionists.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The government on Monday (November 24th) accused Turkey of violating international law by obstructing its oil exploration activities, according to media reports.
Nicosia protested an incident on November 13th when Turkish warships prevented a Norwegian-flagged vessel commissioned by the Cypriot government from conducting an exploratory survey within Cyprus's exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean Sea.
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in which he accused Turkey of continuing "its unacceptable policy of questioning the sovereign right of the Republic of Cyprus".
The Cypriots lodged a formal protest with the European Commission as well.
Cypriot media reported that another incident occurred on Monday, when a Turkish frigate allegedly tried to obstruct two Norwegian-owned vessels, one exploration ship and an escort, off the island's coast.

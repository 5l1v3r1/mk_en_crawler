SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano and Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski met in Sofia on Tuesday (28 December) to seal a political declaration of support for a regional oil pipeline project.
A memorandum of understanding was also signed by the respective cabinet ministries and the US-based AMBO Corporation, which is implementing the $1.2 billion project.
The pipeline will link Bourgas, Bulgaria and Vlore, Albania, and is expected to carry 35m tonnes of crude oil annually.
Bulgaria views the AMBO project as an alternative to another major energy initiative with Greece and Russia -- the Bourgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, which has been repeatedly delayed due to Moscow's failure to sign the trilateral agreement.

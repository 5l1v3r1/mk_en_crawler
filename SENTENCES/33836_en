BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A student movement which played a key role in toppling Slobodan Milosevic announced Wednesday (19 November) that it has decided to set up a political party for the 28 December general elections.
Otpor has already formally filed registration papers.
From Strasbourg, France, Council of Europe official Peter Schieder said the elections must not fail, as they are "not only about the composition of the parliament, but about the stability of democratic institutions and the future of democracy in Serbia".
In other news, the 10-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition announced Wednesday that it was disbanding, having completed its mission of toppling the Milosevic regime.

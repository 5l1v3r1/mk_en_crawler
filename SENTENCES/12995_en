BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told the Financial Times on Monday (28 February) that further extraditions of suspected war criminals are likely before the end of March.
His statement followed the surrender of former Bosnian Serb Army General Radivoje Miletic to the UN tribunal.
He attributed the recent surrender by several suspects to changing public attitudes and a "growing awareness" among indictees that they are a burden to their country.
UN prosecutors and Western governments are opposed to Kostunica's policy of voluntary surrenders and insist that Serbia should begin to arrest indictees.

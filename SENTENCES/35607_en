BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Turkey has proved it is a modern and democratic country complete with rule of law, religious freedom, transparent government and a good human rights record, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Thursday (5 February), in a speech to the 16th Congress of the European People's Party (EPP) in Brussels. 
It was the first time Turkey has participated in an EPP congress. 
Gul said the occasion was significant, as the EPP is a foundation stone of European policies, values and traditions.
While in Brussels, Gul also met with EU security chief Javier Solana. 
They discussed the Cyprus dispute, the situation in the Middle East and in Iraq, Turkey-EU relations, the dispute between Turkey and Armenia, and joint defence strategies.

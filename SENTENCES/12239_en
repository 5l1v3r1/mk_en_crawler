SOFIA, Bulgaria -- President Georgi Parvanov called again on Thursday (12 May) for a nationwide referendum on EU membership.
He suggested it could be held simultaneously with the elections for members of the European Parliament.
He says public support for EU entry is high enough for the referendum to be successful.
The same day, Deputy Foreign Minister Gergana Grancharova said the ruling coalition would leave the issue of whether to hold such a referendum to the next cabinet.

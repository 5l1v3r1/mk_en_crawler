SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The Lustration Commission confirmed on Wednesday (September 29th) that Constitutional Court President Trendafil Ivanovski collaborated with the communist-era secret police and can no longer occupy his post.
At a public hearing Monday, Ivanovski denied the accusations, claiming he is a victim both of the past and present regimes.
He vowed to bring his case to the Administrative Court and the Supreme Court.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski says the lustration decision undermines the credibility of the Constitutional Court and the legitimacy of its decisions.

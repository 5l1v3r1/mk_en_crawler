PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- A group of Montenegrin intellectuals and former government officials announced Saturday (1 October) that it would launch a campaign aimed at setting 26 March 2006 as the date for a referendum on independence.
"Montenegro is in a hurry for freedom and a new beginning," said Branko Lukovac, president of the Movement for an Independent European Montenegro.
Last week, Montenegro's Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic pledged to hold a referendum on independence sometime between February and April 2006.

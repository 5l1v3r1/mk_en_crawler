BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Thursday (15 May), the Republika Srpska ombudsman issued a report which voices disappointment with respect for human rights in the Bosnian Serb entity.
Branka Kolar-Mijatovic told reporters that 22,000 people had contacted her office in 2002 and more than 4,000 had filed written complaints.
About two-thirds of all cases concerned the return of the property of people displaced by the 1992-1995 war.
Another 10 per cent of the complaints concerned deficiencies in the local judiciary system.

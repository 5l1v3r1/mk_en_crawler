SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US Ambassador to Bulgaria John Beyrle said on Tuesday (January 16th) that there is no link between the case involving five Bulgarian nurses, sentenced to death in Libya for allegedly infecting children with HIV, and the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin, Beyrle added that as an ally of Bulgaria, the United States would do everything possible to free the nurses. 
For his part, Kalfin said it is unacceptable to discuss any deal involving exchanging the nurses for Libyan terrorist Mahmoud Said al-Moghrabi, who is serving a life sentence in Britain for the Lockerbie bombing.
On Wednesday, the European Parliament planned to discuss a draft resolution on the nurses' case. 
It urges Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi to intervene and order their immediate release.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The US government has again urged BiH leaders to move ahead with the constitutional reform process and intensify negotiations aimed at reaching a consensus.
A statement issued by the US Embassy in Sarajevo on Friday (17 February) called on leaders of the eight largest BiH parties to make good on their pledge to agree on restructuring state institutions -- including the tripartite presidency -- by the end of March.
Also Friday, Dutch diplomat Peter Bas-Backer officially assumed the post of senior deputy high representative in BiH.
Predecessor Martin Ney's mandate expired earlier this month.
On Saturday, meanwhile, the Bosnian film "Grbavica", directed by Jasmila Zbanic, won the coveted Golden Bear award at the 56th Berlin Film Festival.
The film examines the aftermath of mass rape during the siege of Sarajevo.

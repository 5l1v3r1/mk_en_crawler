SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj said on Thursday (January 22nd) that BiH recognises only the passports UNMIK issued to Kosovo citizens, not the new Kosovo passports. 
He added he had no information about how many people have failed to gain access to BiH because they offered the new Kosovo-issued ID documents instead. 
He reiterated that bearers of those documents could neither cross BiH's border nor apply for a visa.

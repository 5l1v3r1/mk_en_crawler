TIRANA, Albania -- Albania has asked the United States for assistance in destroying its stockpile of chemical weapons, the US State Department announced Monday (10 January).
According to deputy spokesman Adam Ereli, Tirana "has fully co-operated with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in identifying the chemical weapons stockpile, in making a full stockpile declaration, and in ensuring the stockpile is secure and moving toward destruction as rapidly as possible." In the 1970's, long-time Marxist leader Enver Hoxha apparently began stockpiling chemical weapons and building concrete bunkers, fearing attacks from abroad.

TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Wednesday (August 19th) that state officials will be losing some of their perks in an effort to slash spending.
He noted for example that every year, millions of euros are spent for personal services, such as drivers and cars.
"Each official vehicle costs about 13,000 euros a year," Berisha told cabinet ministers.
Transportation benefits will be folded instead into a monthly stipend.

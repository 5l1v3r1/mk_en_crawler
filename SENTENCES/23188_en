ANKARA, Turkey -- The Constitutional Court's decision Monday (March 31st) to hear a case on the proposed closure of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is cause for concern among the international community.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned that the possible closure of the AKP would significantly complicate Turkey's EU accession talks.
He described the move as unjustified and unnecessary and reiterated that such issues should be resolved in parliament, and not in courtrooms.
Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya filed the request two weeks ago, accusing the AKP of undermining the secular nature of the state.
Most had assumed the court would reject the motion.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- About 1,000 retired army officers protested near the presidential palace in Bucharest on Monday (October 25th), against the government's pension reform that would cut their income. 
Protests were also held in front of prefect offices in several other cities across the country. 
Besides insisting the government cancel the pension reform, the demonstrators also demanded the country should overall cancel its 20 billion-euro agreement with the IMF, which was the reason for passing the measures.

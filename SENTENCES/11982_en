SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A Bosnian court on Wednesday (15 June) sentenced a Serb man to six years in prison for war crimes.
Goran Vasic was found guilty of cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners at the Nedjarici detention camp near Sarajevo in 1992.
But the defendant was acquitted of the 1993 assassination of Bosnian Deputy Prime Minister Hakija Turajlic, who was gunned down at a UN checkpoint on the road between Sarajevo and its international airport.
Vasic's sentence will be reduced by the time he has spent in custody.
In other news, Serbia's special war crimes court asked the government to seek the extradition from Argentina of a man accused of killing ethnic Albanians in 1999.
Nebojsa Minic is accused of ordering his paramilitary group to murder two entire families in Pec.
Argentine authorities arrested Minic in May.

ATHENS, Greece -- A strong explosion shook the offices of a real estate state agency in Athens late on Thursday (March 19th).
Preliminary investigations suggest that a gas leak may have caused the blast in the Ambelokipi district.
The agency was recently involved in a land swap scandal between the government and an influential Orthodox monastery, which caused huge losses to the state.
Bombings and other violent acts have surged in Athens since police shot a teenager dead last December.
In other news, pirates have seized a Greek-owned cargo ship off the coast of Somalia.
The merchant marine industry says the "Titan" was carrying a load of iron to South Korea when pirates surrounded it Thursday evening.
There are 24 crewmen aboard, including three Greeks and one Romanian.

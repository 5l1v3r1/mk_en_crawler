SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Following a cabinet session Wednesday (April 30th), Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev announced that 13 deputy ministers are losing their jobs in a week. 
The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party and its coalition partner, the National Movement for Stability and Progress, will remove six of their deputy ministers, while the Movement for Rights and Freedom will remove one. 
Stanishev stressed that the changes stem mostly from functional reasons. 
Valentin Petrov, chief secretary of the interior ministry, will also be leaving due to planned changes among law enforcement authorities.

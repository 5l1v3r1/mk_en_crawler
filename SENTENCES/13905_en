BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The president of Serbia-Montenegro said on Friday (16 September) that he might resign because he feels he has become the victim of "fabrications". 
Svetozar Marovic, a Montenegrin, has been embroiled in a feud with Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic. 
Dinkic had accused the union's defence minister, Prvoslav Davinic, of corruption for authorising an armed forces procurement deal behind the back of the Serbian government. 
Marovic defended Davinic and was himself accused of corruption. 
He also refused to lead the union's delegation to the 60th UN anniversary summit in New York. 
Montenegrin officials meanwhile warned Serbia that toppling the president could result in the break-up of the fragile federal union. 
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic announced on Saturday that representatives of Belgrade and Podgorica would meet soon to discuss issues related to the procurement affair.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The OSCE is pleased with government efforts to co-operate with international organisations, according to statements made Saturday (10 July) during a seminar on the Croatian island of Sipan. 
The organisation had already praised reform efforts by the government during a regular session in Vienna. 
During that meeting, OSCE mission chief Peter Semneby said that Croatia has a good chance of making further progress if the government maintains its current course.

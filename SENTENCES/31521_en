TORONTO, Canada -- On Tuesday (21 January), police announced the arrest of a former Serbian police officer wanted for war crimes. 
Dejan Demirovic, 27, was apprehended in front of his home in Windsor, Ontario. 
He is being tried in absentia in Serbia for the 1999 murders of at least seven ethnic Albanians in Podujevo. 
A Canadian immigration official said the arrest demonstrated his country's determination not to serve as a save haven for criminals.

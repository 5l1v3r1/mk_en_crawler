ATHENS, Greece -- Hundreds took to the streets of Athens on Thursday (November 25th) to protest further austerity measures envisioned in the 2011 budget. 
The protestors were carrying banners reading "This is far enough, we can't take any more." A three-hour work stoppage paralysed public transportation in the city. 
The protest was a rehearsal ahead of a December 15th nationwide 24-hour general strike called by the public sector labour union ADEDY and the private sector GSEE.

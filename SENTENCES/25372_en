ATHENS, Greece -- The civil servants' trade union ADEDY announced on Tuesday (December 22nd) that it plans to stage a 24-hour strike in late January or early February against the labour and wage reforms planned by the government, in the face of ballooning debt and deficits. 
"We will not accept that the cost of the crisis will be borne on our shoulders," ADEDY head Spyros Papaspyros told Reuters. 
The private sector trade union, the General Confederation of Greek Workers, also said on Tuesday that it is considering a strike.

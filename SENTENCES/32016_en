BUCHAREST, Romania -- Coal miners fighting to save their jobs ended their strike Thursday (21 November) and agreed to come out of the mine after management signed a protocol agreement with their representatives. 
Under the document, the Horasti mine will close next year as planned, but its 600 employees will be transferred to other mines in the regions, their salaries unchanged. 
Nearly 300 coal miners blockaded themselves underground Tuesday to protest the planned closing.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A two-day conference of the Balkan Political Club, a regional NGO involving former Balkan political leaders and prominent intellectuals, began in Sarajevo on Saturday (6 May).
Opening the conference, the organisation's chairman, former Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, said the meeting is aimed at better understanding the problems confronting BiH in the months and years ahead.
In his address, BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic said he expects the role of the Office of the High Representative to be reduced, but added that full abolition depends on the implementation of crucial constitutional reforms.

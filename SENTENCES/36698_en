PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- UNMIK and KFOR on Tuesday (27 July) firmly denied accusations that they failed to prevent the mid-March violence in Kosovo.
A new report by the NGO Human Rights Watch concludes the two institutions failed to protect minorities during the unrest and did not provide the necessary level of security.
Horst Piper of the KFOR press office says the organisation "has kept the peace and continues to do so" while UNMIK insisted all efforts have been made to protect minorities.

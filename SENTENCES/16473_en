SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The New Social Democratic Party (NSDP), led by Tito Petkovski, is getting two key ministries -- defence and foreign affairs -- in the new Macedonian cabinet, according to a report Tuesday (8 August) by A1 TV. 
Petkovski reportedly has two days to present his candidates for the posts to Prime Minister-designate Nikola Gruevski of the VMRO-DPMNE. 
For its part, VMRO-DPMNE says it wants to retain control over all economy-related ministries.
Also Tuesday, Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) supporters continued to block roads in several cities, including Skopje. 
DUI is protesting its exclusion from the new government and vows to continue the roadblocks all week.

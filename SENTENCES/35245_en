BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian Parliament began discussing draft changes Thursday (19 February) to the law on electing the president.
The bill, based on a proposal by Democratic Party of Serbia, would remove the 50 per cent voter turnout requirement in the first round.
The controversial clause has prevented the election of presidents in the past.
A similar requirement for the second round of voting was removed last year.
Another key draft bill, on electing MPs, is also being reviewed.
It includes a proposal to remove the threshold for parties of national minorities to enter parliament.
The Central Election Commission would determine which parties would be considered.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Adrian Nastase announced on Sunday (19 October) that the results of the two-day referendum on a new constitution are valid. 
Citing preliminary estimates, the electoral commission announced Sunday that turnout was 54.5 per cent. 
Official results are expected early this week. 
The new constitution was drafted to ease Romania's EU accession.
In other news, three cabinet ministers have been forced out over corruption allegations. 
Still unclear is whether they resigned or were fired by Nastase. 
The three are European Integration Minister Hildegard Puwak, who was under EU investigation for possible misuse of EU funds; Health Minister Mircea Beuran; and Government Co-ordination Minister Serban Mihailescu. 
British Ambassador to Romania Quinton Quayle said last week that corruption-related concerns are keeping many foreign investors out of Romania. 
He urged the government to improve its image abroad.

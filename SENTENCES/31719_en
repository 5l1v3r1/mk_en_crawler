BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The international community's High Representative in BiH, Paddy Ashdown and Serbia's Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic met in Belgrade Tuesday (8 April) to discuss issues related to bilateral and regional co-operation. 
The talks focused particularly on the need to step up joint efforts to fight organised crime and bring indicted war criminals to justice. 
Ashdown says he believes all suspects will be arrested and extradited to the UN tribunal in The Hague.
At a separate meeting, BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic and his Serbia-Montenegro counterpart Goran Svilanovic reportedly agreed that Serbia would deliver a list of people suspected of involvement in organised crime to BiH.
On Thursday meanwhile, NATO Secretary General George Robertson is expected to visit Sarajevo to meet with SFOR Commander Lt Gen William Ward, the members of the BiH presidency and other officials.

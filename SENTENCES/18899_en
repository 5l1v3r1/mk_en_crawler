BELGRADE, Serbia -- Work on the plan for the future of Kosovo is at an advanced stage and will be completed by Serbia's January 21st parliamentary elections, Remi Dourlot, a spokesman for UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, said on Thursday (January 4th).
Ahtisaari is expected to brief members of the International Contact Group for Kosovo before he unveils his plan to Pristina and Belgrade.
Diplomats expect the UN Security Council to adopt a new resolution on Kosovo in March or April, closing the UN mission in Pristina and mandating a new international envoy and EU-led police force.
In other news Thursday, the head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo, German diplomat Werner Wendt, announced that elections in the province should take place by November of this year, since they were previously postponed.

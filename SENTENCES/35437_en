SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Two men arrested recently for allegedly helping former Bosnian wartime leader Radovan Karadzic evade justice have started to assist SFOR in efforts to track down the fugitive, according to Dave Sullivan, a spokesman for the peacekeepers.
He said Thursday (12 February) that investigators were "extremely satisfied" with the co-operation and information provided by Dusan Tesic and Zeljko Jovanovic.
Both were once members of the Bosnian Serb special police force.
At the UN, meanwhile, talks on the reunification of Cyprus will resume Friday, following a session that ran well into the night.
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas said both sides would be asked late in the day to either accept or reject a statement to be put forward by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, establishing ground rules for later talks in Cyprus.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police arrested on Monday (April 4th) the war time mayor of the Bosnian town of Trebinje, Bozidar Vucurevic, based on a war crimes warrant issued by Croatia.
Vucurevic was detained at a Bosnian-Serbian border crossing.
A judge in Sabac remanded him to 18 days in custody pending extradition.
Vucurevic, who also helped found the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), is wanted by Zagreb for war crimes against civilians committed during the shelling of Dubrovnik in 1991.
The SDS asked Serbia to immediately release him.

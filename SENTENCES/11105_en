KIEV, Ukraine -- Macedonia and Ukraine plan to broaden their economic collaboration, especially in the areas of energy, construction and trade, it was announced after a meeting Monday (27 June) between the two countries' presidents, Branko Crvenkovski and Viktor Yushchenko. 
During the talks, Crvenkovski expressed Skopje's willingness to expand the presence of Macedonian pharmaceutical, agricultural and food products on the Ukrainian market. 
Yushchenko in turn said Ukrainian firms are interested in Macedonia's natural gas and oil distribution sectors.
In other news Monday, the latest UNDP Early Warning Report suggests that the public's confidence in state institutions continues to decrease in Macedonia. 
Experts say that while there is growing public pessimism about economic prospects, the security situation is no longer a source of concern.

ATHENS, Greece -- Costas Karamanlis, leader of the new ruling party New Democracy (ND), said Monday (8 March) that he would make preparations and conduct of the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics his top priority. 
He added that he intends to assemble a team of lawmakers and ND members who have been working on the preparations, rather than introducing new people into the process. 
The team would troubleshoot and resolve issues as they arise, with Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni and Thessaloniki Mayor Vassilis Papageorgopoulos assuming leading roles. 
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge will be among the first officials to meet with Karamanlis, once parliament officially makes him prime minister.

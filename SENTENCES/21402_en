BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu is asking trade unions to postpone planned protests until December, that is, until after the November 30th general elections.
Basescu warned on Thursday (October 30th) that the strikes might jeopardise the electoral process.
"This is not the best moment for protests," he told a press conference, adding he would be open to discussions after the elections.
He assured teachers a 50% pay hike will come into force as soon as a new government takes office.
Earlier this week, the government decided to postpone implementing a 50% raise for teachers until April 1st.
In response, the country's main unions threatened to stage strikes affecting state institutions, schools and hospitals next month.

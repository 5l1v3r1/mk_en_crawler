BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Michael Steiner, the UN's chief officer in Kosovo, was in the Yugoslav capital on Thursday (17 October) to try to persuade political and religious figures to support upcoming local elections in Kosovo. 
"Serbs can become part of political life in Kosovo only if they take part in elections," Steiner said, adding that Serb representation in local government would enable the return of more than 200,000 refugees. 
Several officials, including Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic, have said they might agree to encourage participation in the 26 October election, if the UN was willing to grant a certain degree of autonomy to the Serb enclaves. 
The Serbian Orthodox Church issued a statement voicing reservations about the vote.

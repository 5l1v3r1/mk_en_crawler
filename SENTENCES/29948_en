ANKARA, Turkey -- The foreign ministry on Saturday (January 22nd) slammed a statement by Greek President Karolos Papoulias, who referred to Turks as "barbarians".
Ankara warned that such statements can harm reconciliation efforts between Greece and Turkey.
During a meeting with his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sargsyan in Athens, Papoulias said "Turkish barbarians committed massacre against the Greek and Armenians at the start of the 20th century.
We [the Greeks and the Armenians] were butchered by the same barbarian." (Hurriyet - 23/01/11;

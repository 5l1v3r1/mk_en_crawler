TIRANA, Albania -- The High Council of Justice (HCJ) rejected a demand by Justice Minister Ilir Rusmajli on Tuesday (May 22nd) to dismiss HCJ member Artan Gjermeni.
Following hours of heated debate, Rusmajli's request was turned down by a vote of 6-5.
Neither Rusmajli nor Gjermeni were allowed to vote.
Rusmajli says Gjermeni has links to the Lushnja clan, one of the biggest criminal groups in Albania.
Gjermeni dismisses the allegations as politically motivated.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Speaking to reporters Thursday (June 7th), Branko Hrvatin, president of Croatia's Supreme Court, rejected recent criticism from Transparency International Croatia, which suggested there are too many magistrates in the system.
Hrvatin said that 1,500 magistrates handle around 2.6 million cases every year.
He rejected comparisons to Finland, whose judicial system has far fewer employees, and said the Finnish magistrates handle about one-tenth the number of Croatia's cases.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- President Boris Tadic called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council on Wednesday (October 13th) to discuss anti-gay violence that erupted in Belgrade on Sunday, as well as vandalism that occurred Tuesday during a football match in Italy. 
The authorities vowed to take strong measures against those responsible for the violence. 
Police in the Italian town of Genoa arrested 17 Serbians late Tuesday, all of them suspected of causing riots at the Luigi Ferrari Stadium, during a match between Serbia and Italy. 
Among those detained was the alleged instigator. 
The UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying match was called off only six minutes after it started when Serbian fans threw flares that landed near Italian goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano.
After the match was cancelled, Serbian fans leaving the stadium clashed with the police. 
Sixteen people, including two police officers, were injured. 
Incidents were also reported before the match. 
Some fans stormed Serbia's team bus, assaulting goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic over his recent decision to join the Partizan football club -- a bitter rival of Red Star Belgrade. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic phoned Italian counterpart Franco Frattini on Wednesday to formally apologise for the fans' behaviour.
In Tirana, meanwhile, dozens of Albanian youth protested outside of the Serbian Embassy on Wednesday against the hatred displayed during the match in Italy. 
They burned a Serbian flag, in response to fans who had torched an Albanian flag at the Genoa stadium.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The government and striking teachers' unions reached a preliminary deal on higher wages late on Friday (October 26th), though it requires approval by the rank and file. 
If at least 50% of teachers back it, the more than five-week-long strike may end Tuesday. 
According to the deal, teachers' wages will increase by 19.1% as of November, and by 46.4% by the end of 2008. 
Wages of non-teaching staff will increase by 46.7%. 
Initially, the unions had demanded nearly 100% increases, saying members were pitifully underpaid.

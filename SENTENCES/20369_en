PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- After their regular weekly meeting Tuesday (November 13th), Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker applauded the campaigning conducted so far, ahead of Saturday's local and parliamentary elections. 
Both stressed that candidates are behaving according to democratic values. 
An estimated 1.5 million voters are entitled to vote, including 160,000 first-time voters. 
On Tuesday, the OSCE Mission in Kosovo held a special seminar to educate the public on voting procedures.
Also Tuesday, the radical Vetevendosja (Self-determination) movement called on voters to boycott the election, saying their votes will be used to boost the ambitions of individual politicians rather than the province. 
Separately, Belgrade has urged the Serb minority in Kosovo to shun the elections.

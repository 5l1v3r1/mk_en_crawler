ZAGREB, Croatia -- Zamun Clan member Sretko Kalinic will not appeal Croatia's decision to extradite him to Serbia, Zagreb County Court spokesperson Kresimir Devcic said on Friday (August 13th).
Thus, Kalinic will become the first Croatian citizen to be extradited to another state based on the extradition agreement recently signed between Zagreb and Belgrade.
The extradition procedure will begin after Croatian Justice Minister Drazen Bosnjakovic signs the decision.
Kalinic was arrested in Croatia in June after being shot by a fellow gang member.
In 2007, he was sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison for the March 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

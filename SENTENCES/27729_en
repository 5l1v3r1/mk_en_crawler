BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The EU on Monday (April 26th) urged Armenia and Turkey to continue the process of normalising their ties. 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton expressed her concern about the pace of the process and reiterated calls to continue dialogue without preconditions and within a reasonable timeframe. 
"The full normalisation of bilateral relations ... 
will contribute to security, stability and co-operation in the Southern Caucasus," Ashton said, promising any help and political support that may be necessary. 
Last week, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan signed a decree freezing ratification of two protocols aimed at normalising ties between Armenia and Turkey, but at the same time said that his country is not giving up the process.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Sulejman Tihic of the Muslim Party of Democratic Action, Mirko Sarovic from the Serb Democratic Party, and Dragan Covic from the Croat Democratic Union were sworn in as members of BiH's tripartite presidency on Monday (28 October). 
Although all three are affiliated with nationalist parties, they pledged to put the past behind them and work for political and economic reform. 
The joint presidency was the first institution to be inaugurated following the 5 October vote.
Meanwhile, the United States has decided to terminate its army training and equipment programme, as it believes the BiH federal army has reached an adequate level of stability. 
US Ambassador to BiH Clifford Bond delivered a note to that effect on Monday.

ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said Wednesday (27 April) that 2005 is a crucial year for the Western Balkans, in terms of EU integration prospects. 
He pledged Greece's support for the EU bids of countries in the region, saying it is time for them to turn the Balkans into a stable and modern part of Europe. 
Irreconcilability and prejudice are incompatible with the spirit of neighbourly relations and co-operation promoted by the EU, the prime minister added.

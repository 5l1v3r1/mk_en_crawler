ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis was quoted on Tuesday (28 January) as saying that the UN would probably have to revise again its proposal for the reunification of Cyprus to meet his country's concerns. 
His comments followed a meeting with UN envoy Alvaro de Soto. 
The UN official in turn was upbeat after talks with Prime Minister Abdullah Gul later that day. 
De Soto said Turkish leaders believe a solution to remaining issues could be reached by the UN's 28 February deadline. 
He was expected to meet with Justice and Development Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday. 
Erdogan issued a statement Tuesday urging both sides in Cyprus to make concessions and reach a settlement.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic is urging Kosovo Serbs to vote in the 23 October Kosovo parliamentary elections.
Speaking Saturday (31 July), he criticised the Serbian government's call for a boycott, stressing that such a policy helps no one.
Noting that Serbs are entitled to up to 30 seats in parliament, he said the rights of Serbs would be better protected if they were represented in parliament and actively participated in government.

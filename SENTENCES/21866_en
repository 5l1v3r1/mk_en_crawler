PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Currently, Montenegro has no plans to recognise Kosovo's independence, Miodrag Vukovic, one of the leaders of the country's ruling Party of Democratic Socialists, told the Vecernje Novosti newspaper Sunday (August 17th). 
"We will think about this issue when the situation requires it. 
When and if this will happen, we do not know," Vukovic said. 
"We have clearly said that we will neither hurry nor run late with this issue. 
We will be led solely by European perspectives and stability; this issue is not our priority." (B92 - 18/08/08; Vecernje Novosti - 17/08/08)

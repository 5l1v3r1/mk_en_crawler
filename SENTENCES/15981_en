SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Two agreements on co-operation between Albania and Macedonia were signed Friday (19 May), during a visit to Tirana by representatives of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), the ethnic Albanian partner in Macedonia's coalition cabinet. 
DUI leader Ali Ahmeti headed the delegation, which included three cabinet ministers. 
The agreements call for co-operation in post-graduate studies in the fields of construction and seismology, and for liberalisation of transit between the two neighbouring states.
While in Tirana, Ahmeti met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha to discuss the 5 July parliamentary elections in Macedonia. 
He assured Berisha that the DUI would take all measures to ensure that the forthcoming vote will be fair and free.

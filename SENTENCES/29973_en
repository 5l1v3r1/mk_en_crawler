BUCHAREST, Romania -- The National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) announced on Friday (February 25th) the arrest of a customs chief suspected of taking a bribe from a Turkish company.
Prosecutors say Cornel Costea, from the southern city of Ploiesti, has accepted about 40,000 euros from the company since November in return for allowing trucks to cross the border uninspected.
Costea admits to taking the bribes, but says he shared them with other customs officials, including the head of the local customs control agency, Sorin Blejnar, who denies the accusation.

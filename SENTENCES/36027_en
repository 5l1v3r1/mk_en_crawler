ZAGREB, Croatia -- Michael Weninger, the European Commission (EC) president's advisor on religious issues, said Saturday (27 March) that Croatia has come a long way on the path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. 
The EC, he said, perceives Croatia as an inseparable part of Europe. 
Croatia's Prime Minister Ivo Sanadar met with members of the Commission earlier last week, receiving assurances of EU support in its efforts to meet the Union's criteria for acceptance.

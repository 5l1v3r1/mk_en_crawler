SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Central Election Commission announced the final results of Sunday's parliamentary elections late Tuesday (July 7th). 
As expected, Boyko Borisov's centre-right Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) was first, winning a total of 116 seats in parliament, just five shy of the absolute majority required to form a government.
The former ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party won 40 seats, their poorest showing in two decades. 
The ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a fellow member of the outgoing ruling coalition, won 38. 
The ultra nationalist Ataka (Attack) party got 21 mandates, compared to 15 for the right-wing Blue Coalition and ten seats for the newly-formed conservative party Order, Law, Justice.
Meanwhile, the Blue Coalition announced on Tuesday it will start unofficial talks with GERB on forming a new cabinet. 
"We have similar political programmes," said one of the leaders, Ivan Kostov. 
Borisov says members of the new cabinet will be announced late next week.

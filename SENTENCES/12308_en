ATHENS, Greece -- Two major labour unions called a strike in the transport sector on Wednesday (11 May), crippling much of the country. 
The unions were angered by a government decision to postpone the 1 May celebrations until 11 May because this year's Labour Day coincided with Eastern Orthodox Easter.

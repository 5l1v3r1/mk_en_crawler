ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Croatian Radio and Television (HTR) Programmes Council voted on Tuesday (December 8th) to remove the broadcaster's Director General Vanja Sutlic. 
The directors of Croatian television HTV Blago Markota, Croatian Radio Davor Mezulic and Music Production Josip Guberina were also dismissed. 
Sutlic said he was unable to implement necessary reforms, given strong resistance inside the HRT. 
He added that he did not have the support of the government, parliament or the HRT Programmes Council regarding the launch of new TV channels. 
The changes in HRT's management come amid claims of mismanagement and falling ratings.

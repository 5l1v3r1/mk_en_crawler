BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Following a series of protests by pensioners earlier this week, the government of Republika Srpska has agreed to meet most of their demands, the Association of Pensioners announced. 
The two sides held talks Thursday (23 October) and plan to sign a protocol on specific social commitments soon. 
The document will set up conditions for a pension hike of 6 per cent and immediate disbursal of overdue payments.
In other news, trade unions in the energy sectors of the two BiH entities signed a co-operation agreement Thursday in Sarajevo. 
This was in advance of the planned privatisation of the power distribution industry.

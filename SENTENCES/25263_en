TIRANA, Albania -- The Constitutional Court will strike down an agreement on maritime borders between Albania and Greece, according to local media reports Tuesday (January 26th). 
The court is expected to rule that the document violates the Albanian Constitution and must be renegotiated. 
The agreement, delineating maritime borders in the Ionian Sea, was signed in April 2009 during a high-profile meeting between Prime Minister Sali Berisha and his then Greek counterpart, Costas Karamanlis. 
Adoption by parliament was blocked in November, after the opposition Socialist Party moved to have it reviewed by the Constitutional Court.

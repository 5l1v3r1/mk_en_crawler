SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The cabinet on Wednesday (October 31st) effectively broke off negotiations with teachers, whose strike is continuing for a sixth week in a row. 
Education Minister Daniel Valchev said it is too late for talks because the 2008 budget draft has been submitted to parliament. 
The cabinet has offered a total raise of 46.4% by the end of the first half of 2008, with part of the increase available this month.

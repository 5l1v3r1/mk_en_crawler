PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Local media reported on Monday (March 1st) that Kosovo is expected to participate in a summit organised by Slovenia and Croatia in Kranj, near Ljubljana, on March 20th. 
However, the country will be urged to take part in the event not as a republic but under the name "Kosovo/UNMIK" or "UNSC 1244", according to diplomatic sources in Brussels. 
This moniker was chosen to ensure Serbia's participation in the summit. 
Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and his Croatian counterpart, Jadranka Kosor, are inviting the heads of Balkan countries as well as EU institutional leaders. 
Pristina authorities have said that Kosovo's representation through UNMIK is unacceptable.

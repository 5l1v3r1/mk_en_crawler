BELGRADE, Serbia -- Eight former police and gendarmerie officers went on trial in Belgrade on Monday (October 2nd) for the 1999 murders of 48 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
The victims, most of them members of a single family, included 14 children, a pregnant woman, and a 100-year-old relative. 
They were rounded up and executed in the town of Suva Reka on the first day of the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
In other news, a witness to the June 2000 assassination attempt against former Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic was killed in Belgrade on Monday. 
Goran Mijatovic died after a bomb planted under his car exploded. 
A known criminal, he had survived another murder attempt years ago.

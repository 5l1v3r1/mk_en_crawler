ANKARA, Turkey -- After a week of controversy over the signatures on the government's constitutional amendments, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) resubmitted the package with renewed signatures on Monday (April 5th).
The new draft includes 265 signatures, including that of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Last week, the opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) challenged the package in the Constitutional Court, arguing that some signatures were fake.
The new package is expected to be on the respective committee's agenda on Thursday.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prosecutors sought a 29-day detention for media mogul Sorin Ovidiu Vantu and his aide on blackmail charges Thursday (April 21st).
Vantu, owner of the Realitatea TV, was arrested late Wednesday along with aide Ion Ilie.
Transcripts of a telephone conversation detail Vantu asking manager Sebastian Ghita to pay 150,000 euros to end a management contract.
Vantu allegedly noted he "has shot dead" hundreds of gangsters.
This is his second arrest in six months.
In October 2010, he was detained for allegedly helping a convict flee the country.

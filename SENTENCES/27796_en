PARIS, France -- The foreign ministry announced on Tuesday (August 24th) that French officials will meet with Romanian representatives Wednesday to discuss the repatriation of hundreds of Roma.
Romanian Secretary of State of the Public Order and Safety Department Dan Valentin Fatuloiu and Secretary of State for Social Integration Valentin Mocanu will talk about concrete co-operative measures to address difficulties facing the Roma community, the statement said.
They will meet with French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux, Immigration Minister Eric Besson and Pierre Lellouche, secretary of state in charge of European affairs.
Mocanu said on Tuesday that more than 200 Roma have returned to Romania since last week, when Paris began expelling them in a move aimed at improving security.
Besson said last week that more than 850 Roma will return to Romania and Bulgaria by the end of next week.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A vote of no-confidence against the ministers of labour and health failed by wide margins Tuesday (March 23rd).
The vote against Health Minister Cseke Attila was initiated by the National Liberal Party.
Attila said the motion was actually against the policy of his predecessors, as he only took office in early 2010.
It was much the same for Labour Minister Mihai Seitan, who has been strongly criticised for growing unemployment in recent months.
The Social Democratic Party launched the no-confidence motion against Seitan.

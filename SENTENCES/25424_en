SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The EU and the United States launched a new initiative to amend BiH's constitution, presidency member Dragan Covic announced on Thursday (March 25th). 
Officials from Spain -- the current EU presidency holder -- and the US have drafted proposals they plan to introduce at a meeting early next month with leaders of the main political parties in BiH. 
The amendments are aimed at moving the country forward in its EU and NATO integration bids.
In other news, leaders of the biggest Croat and Serb political parties agreed on Thursday to collaborate in the October general elections. 
Under the deal, the Serb Union of Independent Social Democrats and the Croat Democratic Union of BiH agreed to support each other's candidates for the presidency, and potentially for other posts.

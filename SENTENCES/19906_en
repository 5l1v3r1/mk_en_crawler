PARIS, France -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will not rush to recognise an independent Kosovo, BiH Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic said on Wednesday (December 19th) after meeting with his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, in Paris.
"We will not be among the first," Komsic said, adding that if Kosovo declares independence and the EU recognises it, BiH will follow suit.
He stressed that instability in Serbia or Kosovo is not in BiH's interest, nor are delays in the final status process.

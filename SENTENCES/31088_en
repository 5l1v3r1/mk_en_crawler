TIRANA, Albania -- The Central Election Commission (CEC) announced on Saturday (March 5th) it has appointed commissions of electoral zones throughout the country ahead of the May 8th local vote.
Opposition parties, including the main one, the Socialist Party, have refused to meet deadlines in nominating commission candidates, insisting they want to see improvements in the process, to avoid a repeat of the June 2009 general elections.
The CEC ended up replacing opposition members with representatives of the civil society to fill the 66 commissions.

BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- According to federal Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica will address the nation on Wednesday (3 May), regarding fugitive Ratko Mladic. 
The EU deadline for the arrest and extradition of Mladic to the UN war crimes tribunal expired on Sunday, with Mladic still at large. 
Speaking on Monday, Stankovic reiterated that war crimes co-operation is crucial and that no individual is more important than the state.
The tribunal has made no official comment. 
But Serbia-Montenegro's Human Rights Minister Rasim Ljajic, chairman of the national council for war crimes co-operation, has said in a media interview that he expects the EU to suspend Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks with Belgrade after chief tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte meets with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn on Wednesday.

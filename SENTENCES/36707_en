ZAGREB, Croatia -- Bechtel could sue Croatia if the country backs out of its road construction agreement with the firm, Transport and Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta said Tuesday (27 July). 
At a meeting with Christos Makridis, deputy chief of the European Commission's (EC) mission to Croatia, Kalmeta warned that Croatia might run into legal problems and be liable for damages if it cancels the contract. 
However, as an EU candidate, Croatia would consider the EC's opinion on the issue, he said. 
The EC has criticised the Croatian government for awarding the contract to build a section of the Zagreb-Dubrovnik highway to Bechtel without a public tender.

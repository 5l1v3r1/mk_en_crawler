BERLIN, Germany -- Turkey's possible membership in the EU and talks leading to it would make Europe safer and build bridges to the Islamic world, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in an interview to be published Monday (10 October).
He also downplayed fears of an immigration wave following Ankara's accession.
In other news, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul spoke with Sky Turk on Friday, saying 2014 would be a "fair" date for full membership in the EU, if the Union decides to start accession negotiations with Ankara at the end of this year.
Meanwhile, a Finnish Parliamentary delegation visits Turkey on Sunday to discuss EU integration issues and bilateral relations.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu on Thursday (20 January) asked his ministers to check all public contracts signed by the previous administration for suspected irregularities.
He went on to add that he would not tolerate waste and fraudulent deals that fill the pockets of businessmen at the expense of the people.
President Traian Basescu, meanwhile, rejected the Austrian government's plans to build a prison in Romania.
Austria had wanted to send Romanian nationals who had been convicted on its territory to this facility.
The previous government in Bucharest had agreed to the plan.
On Friday, Basescu visits Moldova.
His office says he will express support for Moldova's EU integration and seek more rights for the Romanian community there.

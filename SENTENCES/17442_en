CAIRO, Egypt -- At a session on Monday (July 30th), the Arab League called on the Bulgarian government to respect its agreements with Libya concerning the release of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor with Bulgarian citizenship. 
The final communique of the meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo, however, does not mention any sanctions or countermeasures against Bulgaria. 
Libyan foreign minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham was absent from the summit, Focus news agency said. 
The six medics were pardoned by the Bulgarian president shortly after they were transferred back to Bulgaria from Libya, where they were sentenced to death twice in a controversial HIV infection case.

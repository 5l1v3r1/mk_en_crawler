BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Serbian parliament adopted changes to the bill on criminal procedure Thursday (22 December), increasing the maximum detention period from two to four years for those facing charges for serious crimes -- those with possible sentences of ten years or more.
Currently, only those facing a potential sentence of 40 years can be detained for four years.
Among the numerous other laws passed on Thursday, parliament adopted changes to the legislation concerning the return of state debt to pensioners.
Based on the changes, the pensioners will receive the arrears in cash instead of bonds.

Starting on Monday (September 12th), SETimes readers will have a new option when it comes to coverage of developments in Turkey.
We are pleased to announce the launch of SES-Turkiye, a webpage dedicated exclusively to Turkish news and views.
Updated five days a week, it will provide a rich assortment of features, reportages and interviews in Turkish and English, along with photography from around the country.
Readers can also interact via the SES-Turkiye Facebook page and Twitter feed, featuring daily article postings, topics for discussion, polls, photo galleries and contests.
Comments and discussion will also follow each posted article.
Our writers will cover the key ongoing issues in Turkey, including politics and the economy, foreign relations and ties with the EU, women's issues and human rights, the Kurdish situation, constitutional reform, energy issues, counterterrorism and security.
SES-Turkiye:
your new home for news from Turkey.

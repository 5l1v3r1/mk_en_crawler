TIRANA, Albania -- The government plans to establish a new anti-terror unit -- the Port Authority Security Force -- in the seaside city of Durres, according to local media reports.
The new structure, expected to become operational in August, will consist of 80 troops, mostly experienced police staff.
They would work closely with the state intelligence service and international structures such as Interpol.
The new unit is one of the measures undertaken by Tirana after the recent terror bombings in London.

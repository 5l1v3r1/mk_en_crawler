LONDON, United Kingdom -- Romania's Victor Hanescu has apologised after being fined almost 12,000 euros for his behaviour at Wimbledon on Friday (June 25th).
He appeared to spit at fans who he says verbally abused him during a match with Germany's Daniel Brand.
"I lost my control briefly in the fifth set after another insult from someone in the crowd.
I should never have done that but I am human and I made a mistake," Hanescu told BBC.
In its fine, Wimbledon cited unsportsmanlike conduct and Hanescu's throwing of the match, after a series of deliberate foot faults in the last set.
Four men in the crowd were arrested for unruly behavior.

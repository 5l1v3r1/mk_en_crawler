SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH political leaders have agreed to strengthen the central government as a step towards easing ethnic divisions, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney said on Monday (19 December). 
The negotiations between the leaders of the top Muslim, Serb and Croat political parties started a month ago in Brussels and continued in Washington where a discussion was made to abolish the tripartite presidency and create a single presidential institution. 
According to McElhaney, a new constitutional amendment has now been agreed upon that would give extra powers to the prime minister of the central government. 
Two new ministries would also be created.

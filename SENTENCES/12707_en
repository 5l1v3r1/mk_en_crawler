BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska police chief Dragomir Andan has retracted his recent comment alleging that radical groups with ties to international terrorism were active in BiH.
In an open letter to EU Police Mission head Kevin Carty, Andan acknowledged that he could not present "firm evidence".
High Representative Paddy Ashdown had given Andan until Monday (6 June) to corroborate his claims.

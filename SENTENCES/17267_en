TIRANA, Albania -- Parliament approved a bill Monday (May 28th) on digital broadcasting, following a walkout by opposition lawmakers that left only 74 people casting votes.
The opposition parties had asked for voting to be delayed by five days in order to incorporate suggestions by all parties and by Brussels.
After this request was denied, the opposition walked out, insisting the bill falls short of EU standards.

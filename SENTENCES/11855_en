SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The National Assembly voted on Thursday (14 July) to adopt a declaration on the country's priorities for the next four years.
Lawmakers from all parties agreed to adopt legislation necessary for EU accession.
This includes reform of the judiciary and measures to combat corruption.
The declaration came after repeated warnings from EU officials that Bulgaria and Romania could miss their chance to join the Union on 1 January 2007 if they do not speed up the reforms.
In other news, President Georgi Parvanov has decided to wait until Monday to grant the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) a mandate to set up a cabinet.
BSP won the 25 June parlimentary elections, but is still negotiating a governing coalition with the National Movement Simeon II, which came in second.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The international consultative council for Bulgaria, led by former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, voiced concern Tuesday (June 9th) over the corruption rate in the country.
In a report presented Tuesday after six months of monitoring, the council said there are still serious concerns regarding the extent to which corruption has spread in state structures.
An agreement to promote zero tolerance against corruption must engage state institutions in concrete actions to prevent and fight graft, the report stressed.

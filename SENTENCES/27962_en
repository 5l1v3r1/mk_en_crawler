BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu accused the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) on Wednesday (September 22nd) of demanding money in exchange for backing a pension law required by the IMF. 
That echoes a claim by Parliament Speaker Roberta Anastase who said on Tuesday that the PSD had requested millions of euros to support unpopular legislation that will increase the retirement age and cut pensions. 
The bill passed last week in the absence of PSD lawmakers Basescu told private TV channel B1 TV on Wednesday that talks between the PSD and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) had lasted four days. 
In addition, the PSD had allegedly promised to help bring down Prime Minister Emil Boc, who faces dissension within his own party. 
Some PDL members are more inclined to side with Basescu, who reportedly wants Boc replaced with an entirely new PDL-led cabinet. 
Boc's allies in the PDL prevailed, so only some ministers were replaced in a reshuffle earlier this month.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Military police have searched two barracks this week for war crimes fugitives, defence ministry officials confirmed on Thursday (October 18th). 
The raids are described as nearly a daily occurrence, to prove that the army is not sheltering those sought by the UN tribunal in The Hague.
Meanwhile, in an interview with the German weekly Spiegel published on Thursday, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said she is certain fugitive Ratko Mladic will be arrested by the end of the year. 
Del Ponte cited a significant shift in the attitude of the new Serbian government regarding co-operation.

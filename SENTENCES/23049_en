TIRANA, Albania -- An audit of state operations suggests violations worth 41.5m euros occurred during 2007.
In an annual report published on Wednesday (April 2nd), the state auditor said most of the embezzlement, totalling around 19m euros, came from customs and the tax administration.
Auditors say municipalities, the port of Durres, the national power corporation KESH, and other institutions also embezzled state funds.

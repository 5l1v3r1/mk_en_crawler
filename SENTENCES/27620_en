ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish internet rights protection group filed a lawsuit against the state Monday (June 28th) over restricted access to Google services. 
In 2008, Turkey banned access to Google's video sharing platform YouTube due to materials deemed offensive to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. 
Insulting Ataturk is a crime in Turkey. 
According to the Internet Technologies Association, the YouTube ban caused illegal restrictions on other Google services, such as Google Maps and Google Analytics. 
"Millions of internet users and thousands of companies who use Google services have been harmed," said the association. 
Last year, the same organisation filed a lawsuit against Turkey at the European Court of Human Rights over the YouTube ban.

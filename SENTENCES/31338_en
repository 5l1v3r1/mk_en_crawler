BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Paddy Ashdown, the chief international officer in BiH, warned that tough measures would be adopted to punish those who help war crime suspects evade justice. 
He told the Republika Srpska Parliament on Tuesday (29 April) that such people "risk having their freedom to travel removed, their bank account closed, their business investigated and their job removed. 
No one, however high or low, will be excluded from this if they support war criminals." Ashdown also told lawmakers that the time has come for the authorities to clamp down on organised crime. 
The prime minister of the Bosnian Serb entity, Dragan Mikerevic, promised on Tuesday that his government would start seizing property acquired by criminal groups.
In other news Tuesday, the BiH government approved a bill to improve the security situation in the country. 
The document emphasises the need to establish state-level strategies for combating crime, terrorism and human trafficking.

NEW YORK, United States -- The ambassadors of countries on the UN Security Council failed to agree on a new draft resolution on Kosovo, presented by the EU members and the United States, during closed-door talks Friday (June 22nd).
It envisions a delay of 120 days -- to allow more talks between Pristina and Belgrade -- after which UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for the supervised independence of Kosovo would be adopted.
Following the meeting, Russia's UN envoy, Vitaly Churkin, said Russia would not participate in expert consultations on the draft, expected on Monday.
Moscow has threatened to use its Security Council veto to block any Kosovo resolution that is opposed by Serbia.

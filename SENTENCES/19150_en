SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Sarajevo Canton Interior Ministry has issued an arrest warrant for a 29-year old Kosovo Albanian, Lirim Bitici, who is suspected of murdering Ramiz "Celo" Delalic, a well-known mob figure and former Bosniak warlord. 
Delalic, whose attack on a Serb wedding party in Sarajevo helped precipitate the BiH conflict, was shot to death in downtown Sarajevo on Wednesday (June 27th) night. 
The BiH authorities are also working to identify a second person believed to be involved in the murder.

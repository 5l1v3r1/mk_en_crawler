SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament adopted amendments Wednesday (January 10th) to the law on political parties, tightening the legal requirements for parties' registration and re-registration.
It would require all political formations to present a minimum of 1,000 signatures of supporters to re-register -- twice the current minimum of 500 signatures.
If formations fail to meet the new requirements, they would be abolished and face fines.
The Democratic Union for Integration and smaller parties oppose the changes, saying they jeopardise political pluralism.

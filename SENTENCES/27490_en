BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs backed on Tuesday (September 28th) a report saying that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania have met the criteria for visa liberalisation. 
The report was approved by a vote of 49-2. 
The document has already received green light by the EP Foreign Affairs Committee on September 6th.
An EP plenary session vote is scheduled for October 7th and, according to local media, it will be only a formality. 
The final decision on scrapping of visa requirements for BiH and Albania is up to the Council of the EU, which is expected to put the issue on its agenda in October or November.

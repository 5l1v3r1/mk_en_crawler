BRUSSELS, Belgium -- EU foreign ministers on Monday (21 November) authorised the start of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). 
The decision came on the eve of ceremonies in Washington marking the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH. 
Officials said negotiations could start as early as Friday. 
The EU also extended the mandate of its 6,500-strong peacekeeping mission in BiH through next year and said force levels should remain "broadly unchanged".

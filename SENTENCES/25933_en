PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci visited the Serb-dominated municipality of Strpce on Sunday (January 17th) to support its new mayor, Branislav Nikolic, who assumed the post two days ago.
The building housing his office was earlier used by Serb parallel structures active in the region.
Accompanied by Minister of Economy and Finances Ahmet Shala and Minister of Local Government and Administration Sadri Ferati, Thaci met with Nikolic in a restaurant.
Of special interest to Pristina is privatisation of the Brezovica ski centre, which Nikolic says is a priority.
"We hope that we will continue co-operation and of course we need the government's support.
We have a lot of projects and Pristina's support is very important," he added.

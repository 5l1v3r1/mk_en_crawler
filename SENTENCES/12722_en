BUCHAREST, Romania -- Officials announced on Monday (4 April) that ruling coalition candidate Adriean Videanu won Sunday's mayoral race in Bucharest.
The post had been vacant since December, when Traian Basescu was elected president.
Videanu, the candidate of the National Liberal Party-Democratic Party coalition, received 53 per cent of the vote, defeating Marian Vanghelie of the opposition Social Democratic Party, who got 29.6 per cent.
Turnout was described as among the lowest in years.
In other news, the government is launching public debate about reforming the electoral system to include all parties and NGOs.
The goal is to draft a new electoral code by year's end.

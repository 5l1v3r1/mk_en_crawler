SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- A parliamentary panel, the joint commission for defence and security, rejected two key planks in the longstanding effort to reform the country's police forces Wednesday (March 12th).
They voted down the draft law on the directorate for the co-ordination of police bodies and support agencies and the draft law on independent and supervisory bodies of police structures.
The commission also rejected all 93 amendment proposals parties had filed concerning the draft laws.
The House of Representatives must now decide whether to return the bills to the commission for a second consideration or directly approve the bills.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak expressed disappointment Wednesday that panel members failed to move the police reforms closer to adoption.

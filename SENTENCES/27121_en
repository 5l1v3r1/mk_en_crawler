ANKARA, Turkey -- Tens of thousands of Iraqis living in Turkey are expected to vote in the Iraqi parliamentary elections, officials say. 
Four polling stations are open in Turkey -- three in Istanbul and one in the capital, Ankara -- for three days starting Friday (March 5th). 
Turnout among the diaspora in Turkey is expected to surpass that of the previous general election in 2005.
"Approximately 25,000 voters participated in the elections of 2005. 
We expect more than 30,000 voters to cast their ballots this time," the daily Hurriyet quoted Ali Ekber, an Iraqi electoral commission official, as saying.
Turkish security forces will not be involved in the vote process and will not ask for ID cards, Ekber added. 
"Only Iraqi officials will be in charge," he said.
On Friday, Turkey's foreign ministry issued a statement that described the Iraqi vote as crucial for democracy and stability. 
The elections, Iraq's second since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, will help build a political consensus that can serve as the basis for solving Iraqi's problems, the ministry said.
The vote should "reflect the will of the Iraqi people" and not be marred by allegations of fraud, the statement urged.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- President Branko Crvenkovski says he thinks voters will make the correct decision in the November referendum on the new decentralisation laws, adding the public is "politically conscious" and "responsible". 
In a television interview Wednesday (8 September), Crvenkovski said the referendum would clarify "whether the policy pursued in Macedonia since 2001 leads the state towards stability, peace and interethnic trust, built with difficulties but paving the way towards Euro-Atlantic integration, or determines a setback to where we stood in 2001".
The ethnic Albanian parties in Macedonia now differ on the referendum, according to press reports. 
While the junior government partner Democratic Union for Integration called for a complete boycott of the poll, the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) on Thursday urged ethnic Albanians to participate. 
"If the referendum succeeds, then a new dialogue for Macedonia's future should start with the mediation of the international community," DPA leader Arben Xhaferri said.

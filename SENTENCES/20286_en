PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- Police in Kosovo arrested an ethnic Albanian man Tuesday (October 16th) suspected of murdering 14 Serbs. 
Milazim Bytyqi, 30, is accused of massacring the villagers as they worked in a field near the town of Gracko in July 1999. 
The victims were discovered by a British patrol responding to reports of gunfire in the area. 
It was one of the first hate crimes against Serbs after the UN took control of the province. 
A police spokesman said Bytygi will be charged with war crimes.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic kicked off an official three-day visit to Israel on Wednesday (17 December), the first of its kind by a Bosnian cabinet minister.
On his first day in Jerusalem, Ivanic met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as well as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Trade Minister Ehud Olmert.
Ivanic said the Road Map is the only solution to a final peace settlement.
A statement by the BiH Foreign Ministry noted that Ivanic would not be meeting with Palestinian Authority officials.
Sulejman Tihic, the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, has criticised that decision.

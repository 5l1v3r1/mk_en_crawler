ZAGREB, Croatia -- Authorities on Wednesday (30 October) filed criminal charges against four Yugoslav citizens suspected of trying to smuggle explosives to Iraq. 
The interior ministry issued a statement saying investigators found 208 tonnes of multi-purpose explosives during the search of the Boka Star, a Tonga-registered ship intercepted in Croatian waters. 
The explosives were of a type used as powder charges in artillery and rocket weapons, the ministry said. 
The identities of the suspects were not revealed, but two are believed to be still at large. 
Authorities are also working to determine the real owner of the ship and to find firm proof of its final destination. 
Police have established that customs declarations matched neither the actual state, nor the time of loading.

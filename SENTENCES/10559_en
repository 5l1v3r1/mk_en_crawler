NEW YORK, United States -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for action Monday (15 November) following the new report by the Republika Srpska government commission on the Srebrenica massacre.
His spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said that while Annan welcomed the conclusions of the report and the authorities' apology to victims' relatives, he expects the perpetrators to be arrested.

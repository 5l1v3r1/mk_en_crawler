ANKARA, Turkey -- Parliament reopened Wednesday (1 October) amid concerns that a recent court ruling could lead to early elections. 
An appeals court decided on Monday that four leaders of the pro-Kurdish Democratic People's Party had filed false documents enabling it to run in last year's vote. 
Turkey's electoral commission must now decide whether to void the election results and call a new vote, redistribute seats in parliament, or confirm the results of the 2002 election.
In other news Wednesday, Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul presented to parliament a detailed report on developments related to a possible deployment of Turkish peacekeeping forces to Iraq. 
Parliament is expected to act on the US request this month.

TIRANA, Albania -- Junior ruling coalition partner Socialist Movement for Integration (SMI) has reiterated its calls for a solution to the longstanding political crisis in the country. 
SMI General-Secretary Luan Rama said on Sunday (June 20th) there is a lack both of responsibility and actual results in efforts to overcome the crisis. 
"A compromise is needed to speed up the process of ... 
EU integration," said Rama. 
The stalemate between the ruling Democratic Party and opposition Socialist Party stems from the general elections held a year ago. 
Work on EU-related reforms has stalled for months.

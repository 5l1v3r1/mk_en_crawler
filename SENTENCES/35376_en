ZAGREB, Croatia -- Minorities went to the polls Sunday (15 February) to elect representatives to the municipal councils. 
An estimated 220,000 people, representing a total of 13 minorities, chose 100 councilors who will defend their interests at the local level. 
Serbs, numbering more than 200,000, represent the largest minority. 
The others include ethnic Albanians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Romas, Slovaks and Slovenians. 
A first round failed several weeks ago due to a lack of candidates.
In other news Sunday, the foreign ministry announced that Croatia would send 110 tonnes of food and first aid to survivors of the disastrous December earthquake in Bam, Iran. 
This is the second shipment from Croatia.

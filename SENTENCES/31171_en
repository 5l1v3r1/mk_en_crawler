ATHENS, Greece -- Students clashed with police in front of the parliament building Thursday (December 2nd) during the latest protest against government austerity measures. 
About 1,500 people joined the rally. 
Four students were injured and five were arrested during the brief clash, in which police used tear gas. 
Another student rally is scheduled for Monday, to mark two years since the day a teenager was killed by an Athens policeman. 
The incident sparked major riots and unrest across the country.

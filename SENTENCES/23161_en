SKOPJE, Macedonia -- A regional forum titled "Balkan Security:
NATO after the Bucharest Summit" opens on Wednesday (July 2nd) in Skopje.
Participants will discuss the conclusions of the NATO summit in early April and future Alliance enlargement, as well as the security situation and challenges to stability.
Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki, Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski and ambassadors from Turkey, Albania and Romania are due to attend the event, organised by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Institute for Democracy's "Societas Civilis".
The event also features political analysts, lecturers and scientists from the region.
Macedonia failed to receive a NATO membership invitation in April, hindered by its long-running name dispute with Greece.

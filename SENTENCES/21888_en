BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic pledged his support Saturday (September 20th) to the potential unilateral adoption of the trade agreement with EU, even though EU foreign ministers failed to green light the ratification of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement during a meeting last week. 
If Serbia does adopt the trade agreement, it will have to lift several restrictions and reduce customs duties. 
The government's rationale is that the EU has already largely opened its markets to Serbian exporters, and relieving the customs regime with EU members will attract additional investment. 
Economy Minister Mladan Dinkic supported Cvetkovic's view and said Serbia should do everything it can to achieve EU standards.

LONDON, Britain -- Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku reiterated on Tuesday (October 9th) that Kosovo will declare independence from Serbia within days of the December 10th deadline if no deal on its final status is in place by then. 
Ceku led the Kosovo status negotiating team to London, where they met with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband. 
"An independent Kosovo has to happen very soon after December 10th," Ceku said. 
"We are talking a couple of days, not weeks, not months." (Telegrafi, RTK, Tanjug, Kosovapress, AFP - 09/10/07)

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Paddy Ashdown issued a decision Tuesday (29 March) removing Dragan Covic from the post of Croat member of the BiH presidency.
The move followed repeated calls for him to resign in light of criminal charges filed against him recently.
Covic is accused of embezzlement and abuse of office stemming from his term as Federation of BiH finance minister.
In other news, sources within Ashdown's office on Monday praised the launch of political dialogue aimed at reforming the police sector in BiH.
The opposition Union of Independent Social Democrats organised a roundtable on the issue in Banja Luka on Monday.
The discussions included politicians from both BiH entities, as well as representatives of the Office of the High Representative, the EU Police Mission and the BiH Police Restructuring Commission.

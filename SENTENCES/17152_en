MADRID, Spain -- The government announced plans on Tuesday (October 31st) to restrict the hiring of Bulgarian and Romanian workers, after the countries' EU accession in January. 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said limits would remain in force for two years. 
France and Britain also plan to limit access to their labour markets.
Meanwhile, Britain's The Sun reported on Wednesday that a draft report by cabinet ministers Liam Byrne and Geoff Hoon warns of a possible rise in crime when Bulgaria and Romania join the EU. 
"There is a concern that free movement will encourage people from Bulgaria and Romania to come to the UK, drawn towards organised criminal activities already well established in the UK", the leaked report allegedly says. 
The British government has refused to comment.

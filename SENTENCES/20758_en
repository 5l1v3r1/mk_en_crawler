ANKARA, Turkey -- The government announced on Tuesday (November 6th) it has wrapped up reforms of a key law guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression.
Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said the proposed amendments would be put to a vote in parliament shortly.
Current legislation, which includes up to four years in jail for "denigrating Turkishness", has been a significant obstacle to Turkey's EU bid.
In its annual report on the Western Balkan countries released on Tuesday, the Union again criticised Turkey for the law and urged it to make "significant efforts" to reform it.

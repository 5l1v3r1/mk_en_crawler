SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The demands of Republika Srpska (RS) to change the decision of the BiH high representative on the working of BiH Council of Ministers are unacceptable, the OHR said in a statement on Friday (November 9th).
Bosnian Serbs had submitted a proposal that would have made the acceptance of Miroslav Lajcak's plan conditional on the adoption of measures to reinforce the national interests of the country's three ethnic groups -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
Earlier, RS Prime Minister Miroslav Dodik denounced Lajcak's decision to remove quorum requirements for votes held in parliament, which prevents the use of walkouts to stall the adoption of decisions and legislation.
Lajcak said Friday that his decision was "in force and non-negotiable".

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia -- KFOR's recently appointed commander, French General Xavier Bout de Marnhac, said on Friday (September 21st) that he does not expect the province's future status issue to be resolved this year.
"Everybody in Kosovo was speaking in February 2006 about independence by July.
Today we are in 2007 and still with a big question mark ahead of us," de Marnhac told a news conference.
He added that NATO has been planning for the period after December 10th, when ongoing talks are scheduled to end, saying KFOR is more prepared than ever to respond to threats.
In other news, Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister Qiao Zonghuai visited Belgrade on Friday and said Beijing, being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, respects the UN Charter and supports talks between Belgrade and Pristina without any time limitations.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told him Belgrade welcomes that position.
Visiting Washington on Saturday, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that while Kosovo is predominantly a European issue, US support in resolving its final status is crucial.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) said Thursday (November 9th) that the trial against Serb ultranationalist politician Vojislav Seselj would begin on November 27th.
ICTY spokesperson Anton Nikiforov said the tribunal has decided to drop 5 of the 14 charges against Seselj, who stands accused of helping plot the murder, torture and illegal imprisonment of non-Serbs during the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
He surrendered to ICTY in 2003, pleading not guilty on all charges.
The trial is expected to last a year.

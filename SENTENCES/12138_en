ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener rejected on Friday (8 July) the possibility of holding an extraordinary session of parliament over the IMF decision to defer the first revision of the recent stand-by agreement and the release of $815m.
Sener said that even without the financing, Turkey would be fine.
The IMF announced the delay after parliament failed to pass key legislation on social security, one of the most important requirements of the agreement.

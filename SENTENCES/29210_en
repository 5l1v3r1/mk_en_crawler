SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), will be the main parties in BiH parliament, according to early results announced by the Central Election Commission on Tuesday (October 5th).
The vote counting continues.
The SDP, SDA, HDZ BiH and the Alliance for a Better Future (SBB) lead in the race for Federation of BiH (FBiH) parliament as well as for the FBiH cantonal assemblies.
The latest data on BiH's tripartite presidency suggests it will comprise Zeljko Komsic, Nebojsa Radmanovic and Bakir Izetbegovic.
Meanwhile, the SDP said it would propose its leader -- Bosniak Zlatko Lagumdzija -- as the new chairman of the Council of Ministers, to succeed Nikola Spiric.
The party rejected a request by the main Croat party, the HDZ BiH, which suggested the new state-level prime minister should be a Croat, as the previous two prime ministers were from Bosniak and Serb communities.
SDP spokesman Damir Hadzic stressed that the law does not envision a rotation principle as far as the Council of Ministers chairman is concerned.

ATHENS, Greece -- The bill for the Summer Olympics in Athens is now projected to reach 8.95 billion euros -- more than twice the earlier estimates. 
That makes it the most expensive Olympics in history, according to data from the General Accounting Office. 
During a news conference Friday (12 November), Economy and Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis noted that that the Games "were a great investment for Greece which was worth the while, but the Greek people should also know exactly how much they cost." (Kathimerini, AFP - 13/11/04)

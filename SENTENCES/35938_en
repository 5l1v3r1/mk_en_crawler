IZMIR, Turkey -- The United Kingdom supports Turkey's EU membership bid and believes that Europe could not complete itself without Turkey, UK Minister for Europe at the British Foreign Office Denis MacShane said Wednesday (14 January).
In a speech about relations between Turkey, the UK and the EU, he stressed that reaching an agreement on the reunification of Cyprus is not a pre-condition to EU membership, but said it would be highly beneficial.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, has praised the Bulgarian government's efforts to fight corruption and organised crime, and to fully integrate the country into the EU, local media reported on Monday (August 30th). 
In a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Zoellick said he is impressed with the speed of reforms. 
The letter followed his visit to Bulgaria earlier in month, during which it was agreed that the Bank will provide expert assistance and financing to help upgrade Bulgaria's infrastructure. 
Shortly after the visit, the finance ministry released a statement saying that the signed Memorandum of Understanding will not add to budget deficits this year or next.

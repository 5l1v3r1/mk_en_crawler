STRASBOURG, France -- Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said on Wednesday (January 16th) that resolving Kosovo's final status requires a solution unlike any other in the world. 
Speaking to the European Parliament on EU priorities during Slovenia's six-month chairmanship of the EU's rotating presidency, Jansa said the planned EU police mission in Kosovo should contribute to regional stability and help prevent another conflict.
Meanwhile, Serbia's Beta news agency reported on Wednesday that the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, Italy and France -- all members of the Contact Group on Kosovo -- will meet in Slovenia on Saturday to discuss the timetable for that police mission. 
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and EU Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana reportedly will attend as well.

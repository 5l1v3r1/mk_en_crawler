ZAGREB, Croatia -- Interior Minister Ivica Kirin says the government has not received any international arrest warrant from BiH for the former Croat member of the BiH presidency, Ante Jelavic. 
In an interview in Monday's (27 February) edition of the Sarajevo daily Dnevni avaz, Kirin said that while no such documents have been received, Croatian police stand ready to arrest Jelavic -- if he is on Croatian territory -- as soon as an international warrant arrives in Zagreb. 
The BiH State Court says it issued an international arrest warrant for Jelavic last October. 
He fled the country after being sentenced to ten years in prison for abuse of office and misuse of public funds.

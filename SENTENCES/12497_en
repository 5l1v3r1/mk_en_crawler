SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic has voiced his readiness to resign, if he is held responsible for the expected rejection of BiH's bid for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
In an interview in Thursday's (9 December) Dnevni avaz, Ivanic acknowledged BiH would again likely be passed over for PfP membership this week, due to Republika Srpska's (RS) failure to co-operate with The Hague tribunal.
In a separate statement Wednesday, the BiH presidency's Bosniak member, Sulejman Tihic, made the same prediction.
The possibility of sanctions against RS was the focus of talks between RS President Dragan Cavic and the major opposition leader, Milorad Dodik, on Wednesday.
They agreed on the need for urgent measures to prove RS is serious about reforms.

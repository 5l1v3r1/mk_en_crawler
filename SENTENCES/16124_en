SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Eleven Bulgarian cabinet members published their property declarations online on Thursday (15 June), following the income transparency initiative launched by President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, who revealed their wealth in May.
Parvanov and Stanishev called on all ministers and the 72 deputy ministers to follow the suit.
Seven ministers and all of the deputy ministers still have yet to publish their declarations.
Reportedly, heavy fines will be imposed on those officials who fail to submit property declarations.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- The Justice Ministry announced on Tuesday (April 5th) that the government has asked the European Parliament to lift the immunity of Adrian Severin, who is implicated in a bribery scandal.
Severin and two other EP members were the targets of a recent expose by reporters from the British daily Sunday Times, who pretended to be lobbyists.
The request to lift Severin's immunity would allow Romania's anti-corruption prosecutors to investigate the allegations.
He has withdrawn from the EP's Socialist group and from his Social Democratic Party in Romania, but insists on remaining an EP member.
In other news Tuesday, a parliamentary committee passed a draft that allows the killing of stray dogs.
The decision prompted hundreds of animal rights' activists to stage a protest outside of the parliament building.
They insist stray dogs should be sterilised, saying this is cheaper and more humane.

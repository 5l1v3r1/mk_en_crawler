An increase in the number of credit card transactions and credit card debtors is generating concern among Turkish authorities.
According to figures from the Central Bank, credit card transaction volume increased to 5.6 billion euros in August, while unpaid credit card debt stood at 233.2m euros.
A report prepared by the Ankara Chamber of Commerce shows that the number of credit card holders reached 23.2 million in Turkey, a country with a population of 68 million.
For two decades, Turkey has been suffering from economic and political instability.
Following the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) sweeping victory in the November 2002 general election, the government undertook measures to revitalise the economy.
Under its IMF loan package, Turkey is targeting GNP growth of 5 per cent and per capita income of 3,270 euros by the end of 2004.
The increase in credit card transactions is worrisome to the government because of the potential for balance-of-payment difficulties.
According to consumer groups, credit cards are frequently issued without considering the customer's actual purchasing power.
A growing amount of unpaid credit card debt is the result.
The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency has prepared a draft law to get the credit card system in order.
The legislation would require banks to set credit limits based on a user's financial situation, while procedures and conditions for issuing credit cards would be determined by market conditions and international standards.
However, the Turkish Union of Banks (TBB) has called on the government to take a "sensitive" approach, stressing that credit cards contribute to the economy.
During an interview with local television, TBB head Ersin Ozince said placing any limitation on credit cards would be wrong.
Their use helps discourage the unregistered economy, he said.

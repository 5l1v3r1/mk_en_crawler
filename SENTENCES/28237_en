ANKARA, Turkey -- Local prosecutors have launched an investigation into former President Kenan Evren and two generals for their role in a 1980 coup, Milliyet daily reported on Friday (September 17th). 
The move comes as petitions were filed by several individuals and groups calling for the prosecution of Evren and other coup leaders. 
The investigation became possible after the constitutional amendment package was approved by referendum earlier this month. 
The package includes reforms that annul Evren's and other generals' immunity. 
About 50 people were killed in the wake of the 1980 coup while hundreds of thousands were arrested and tortured in prisons.

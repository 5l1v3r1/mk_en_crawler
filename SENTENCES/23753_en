SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Momcilo Krajisnik arrived in Pale on Monday (June 22nd) to see his family. 
The Hague war crimes tribunal granted him three days to visit his ill mother. 
In March, Krajisnik was sentenced to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed against non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict, when he was considered former political leader Radovan Karadzic's right-hand man.
In other news Monday, former Federation of BiH Prime Minister Edhem Bicakcic and former Finance Minister Dragan Covic pleaded not guilty to charges of abuse of power. 
They were accused of embezzling nearly 4m euros while in office between 1999 and 2000. 
Bicakcic and Covic are among 50 officials suspected of purchasing real estate illegally.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- After talks with intelligence agency head Dosta Dimovska, President Boris Trajkovski has accepted her resignation, according to a statement issued Tuesday (6 May). 
His office says the two agreed on her successor: Dragi Grozdanovski, a former intelligence chief and former deputy interior minister. 
Grozdanovski headed the intelligence agency prior to Dimovska's appointment in February 2002. 
Her resignation follows strong pressure from the ruling coalition, which blames her for a wiretapping scandal in 2000 and 2001, when she headed the interior ministry. 
Trajkovski's controversial move to pardon Dimovska has strained his relations with the government.

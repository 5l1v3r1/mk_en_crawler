BUCHAREST, Romania -- Singer Madalina Manole was found dead in her home early Wednesday (July 14th), on what would have been her 43rd birthday.
Police say it was a likely suicide, as a farewell note to her husband has been found.
Local media report that three weeks ago, the singer tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of ibuprofen and paracetamol.
Manole was one of Romania's best loved pop and folk singers.
She had a 1-year-old son.

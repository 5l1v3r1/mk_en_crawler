ANKARA, Turkey -- Warplanes on Thursday (September 25th) struck terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) positions in two separate regions of northern Iraq, senior security sources said on Friday.
The PKK confirmed the attack, saying it wounded one of its members.
Turkish armed forces have conducted several cross-border operations, including a brief land offensive, against PKK bases over the past year.
The area is considered a staging area for attacks inside Turkey.
In other news Thursday, a Turkish court fined three journalists for an interview with PKK members published in 2004.
The court ruled that the journalists from the daily Hurriyet were guilty of "spreading the propaganda of a terrorist organisation".

PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Border demarcation between Kosovo and Montenegro should be completed by the end of the year, Interior Minister Ivan Brajovic and his Kosovo counterpart Bajram Rexhepi said on Monday (June 21st) in Podgorica.
"The administrative boundaries of former Yugoslavia have already been transformed into state borders," Brajovic said.
The two ministers also said that they have found a provisional solution for Kosovo shepherds who demand the right to use their pastures in Montenegrin territory.
They also discussed the Montenegrin minority in Kosovo, who Brajovic says must be included in Kosovo's Constitution.

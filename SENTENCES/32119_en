SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Negotiations between the Together for Macedonia coalition and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) aimed at forming the new government have entered the final stage. 
Monday's (14 October) talks will focus on distributing the ministerial posts among the partners in the SDSM-led coalition, which won last month's elections in Macedonia. 
Petar Gosev from the Liberal Democratic Party is expected to be the next minister of finance. 
Together for Macedonia has proposed that ten ministries go to them and four to DUI. 
In addition, DUI would be given the post of deputy prime minister. 
Prime minister-designate Branko Crvenkovski says the nominated ministers will be announced by week's end.

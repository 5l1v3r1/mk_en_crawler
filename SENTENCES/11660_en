BUCHAREST, Romania -- EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced strong concerns Monday (18 July) about the political situation in Bucharest, during talks with Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu in Brussels.
Referring to prospects for early parliamentary elections this autumn, Rehn said that while elections are a domestic matter, every day counts for Romania in terms of implementing reforms related to its planned EU entry in 2007.
Tariceanu recently announced his resignation after the Constitutional Court rejected a key judicial reform law.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Reinhard Priebe, director for the Western Balkans in European Commission (EC) Enlargement Directorate, told Voice of America on Tuesday (October 10th) that it is too early to speculate on a starting date for accession talks with the EU. 
Priebe said Macedonia has a long way to go in terms of reforms. 
In its next progress report on Macedonia, the EC will be very specific in terms of areas requiring more attention, he added.
In other news, President Branko Crvenkovski said he would agree with the government's request to recall Macedonian Ambassador to the United States Ljupco Jordanovski over public squabbling with another Macedonian ambassador. 
At the same time, he reminded the cabinet that decisions regarding ambassadors are the president's responsibility.

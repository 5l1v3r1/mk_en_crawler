SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Workers at Bulgaria's largest metal-processing plant, Kremikovtzi, threatened to launch civil disobedience protests next week if the government fails to save the troubled steel mill. 
They demonstrated in front of parliament Thursday (October 30th), blocking traffic in central Sofia. 
They are demanding guaranteed supplies for Kremikovtzi from the National Electric Company, natural gas supplier Bulgargaz, and the state railway company, BDZ. 
They also want the government to find new investors to operate the plant.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- Marian Sarbu, member of the Chamber of Deputies, announced Friday (February 26th) that he had left the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and its parliamentary caucus. 
He implied he would likely join a group of independent lawmakers, which is consolidating around Gabriel Oprea, another former PSD official. 
Sarbu's move marks the third parliamentary member to quit the PSD after the party elected Victor Ponta as its new chairman. 
Former chairman Mircea Geoana has also been rumoured to be leaving the PSD.
Oprea increased speculation that he is about to form a new left-centrist party after commenting that the need for an alternative left-of-centre group was needed. 
He also suggested that those who recently left the PSD would be welcome in the new formation, particularly Sarbu.

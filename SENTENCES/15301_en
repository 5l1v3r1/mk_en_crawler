SKOPJE, Macedonia -- OSCE's chairman-in-office, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht, visited Macedonia on Thursday (27 April) and called for fair and democratic parliamentary elections in full compliance with OSCE standards. 
In a speech to parliament, De Gucht stressed that the OSCE would dispatch a "robust election observation mission" to make sure there is no repeat of last year's electoral irregularities. 
De Gucht praised Macedonia's new electoral code and the country's ongoing reforms, particularly police and judicial reforms, as well as the decentralisation process.

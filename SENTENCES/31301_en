SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Natasha Butler, spokesperson for EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, urged Macedonian politicians Monday (January 31st) to resume dialogue to guarantee the normal functioning of parliament.
She voiced the European Commission (EC)'s concern over the opposition's decision to boycott parliament and said Brussels is closely following the situation.
Butler also said the EC has sent a representative to Skopje to monitor the situation related to the A1 TV channel.
In Skopje, meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski called for an emergency session of parliament Tuesday with only one topic on the agenda -- the latest developments regarding A1 TV.
He called on opposition parties to end their boycott over the freezing of AL TVâs bank accounts and return to the assembly, adding parliament is the only place for dialogue.
All five opposition parties that walked out of parliament turned down the invitation.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said in an interview with A1 that the decision to block the bank accounts was made by the court, not the government.
He said the cabinet cannot influence court decisions and does not want to shut down the TV channel.

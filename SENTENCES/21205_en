SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) President Milan Jelic suffered a heart attack while watching a football match in his home town of Modrica and died on Sunday (September 30th) at a hospital. 
He was 51. 
A former football player himself, Jelic had undergone bypass surgery in 2003, according to his brother. 
The RS government has declared three days of national morning in honour of the president, who took office almost a year ago. 
A member of the ruling Party of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), he had served in the RS cabinet before that. 
Still unclear is who will succeed him as president. 
Some suggest it could be former RS President Dragan Cavic of the Serb Democratic Party.
In other news Sunday, the SNSD re-elected Milorad Dodik as its leader. 
Dodik received the unanimous support of all 700 delegates at a party congress. 
He reiterated that the RS government has not been blocking reforms in the past year, and insisted the entity is only trying to protect itself from attempts to change BiH's constitutional order.

ATHENS, Greece â Clashes broke out Wednesday (February 23rd) as protesters hurled rocks and petrol explosives during a mass demonstration in front of the parliament building in Athens.
Police responded with tear gas.
The rally, which reportedly drew tens of thousands of participants, was organised by the biggest public and private sector labour unions to protest the government's pension and labour reforms.
Meanwhile, the first 24-hour nationwide strike of the year has closed schools, private businesses, public services, airports and ports.
On Tuesday, the government held the final vote on a bill to liberalise the "closed professions", as they are dubbed.
It passed despite months of strikes against the legislation, which will open up about 140 professions which have long benefitted from strictly controlled licensing or fixed profit margins.
Passing it was part of the government's commitments under the country's massive bailout agreement with the EU and IMF.

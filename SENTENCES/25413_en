SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to BiH, Dimitris Kourkoulas, said in an interview with Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz on Sunday (January 24th) that the country has not yet met all conditions for EU visa liberalisation.
Kourkoulas noted that while the recently passed law on amendments to the criminal code was an important step, some technical tasks remain.
He added that EC experts who plan to visit the country next month will conduct a final evaluation as to whether BIH meets all criteria to allow its citizens to enjoy visa-free travel to EU countries.

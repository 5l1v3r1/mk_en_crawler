SKOPJE, Macedonia -- The new parliament held its first session Thursday (3 October) following the victory of the Social Democrats in last month's general elections. 
By a vote of 72-30, deputies elected Nikola Popovski speaker of the 120-seat assembly. 
He promised to work for completion of the peace process and for economic reform. 
For the first time, ethnic Albanian deputies were able to address the assembly in their own language; interpreters translated for Macedonian lawmakers. 
President Boris Trajkovski is expected to nominate Branko Crvenkovski, the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, to form a new cabinet. 
Observers believe that he will try to form a coalition with Ali Ahmeti's Democratic Union for Integration.

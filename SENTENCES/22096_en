DOHA, Qatar -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (April 15th) that he doesn't believe his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will be shut down by the Constitutional Court.
In Qatar to attend an international conference on democracy and development, Erdogan said the AKP hasn't decided on a strategy yet but has legal experts working on it.
Chief prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya brought the case against the party last month, accusing it of undermining secularism.
Foreign Minister Ali Babacan says the government is considering two options to reform the constitution and make such closures more difficult.
He noted that Council of Europe standards allow the closure only of parties that use or advocate violence.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic admitted on Wednesday (December 3rd) that talks with Russia over a strategic energy co-operation accord have stalled. 
"There are no guarantees that the contract will be signed," Cvetkovic said, since Russia refuses to provide written guarantees for implementing the South Stream pipeline project to carry Russian gas via the Black Sea, Bulgaria and Serbia to the rest of the EU. 
During talks in Moscow last week, Russian authorities said they would implement the project, albeit with a two-year delay. 
The energy accord also contains a contract for the sale of 51% of Serbia's state oil and gas firm, NIS, to Gazprom and a memorandum on the construction and modernisation of the Banatski Dvor underground gas depot. 
Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller will visit Belgrade on Friday.
In other news, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said in a magazine interview Wednesday that the EU is not giving Serbia enough positive signals regarding integration, despite what Belgrade has done to meet its commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement it signed in April. 
Jeremic told the German magazine Stern that unless the EU acts, "people in Serbia will become uncomfortable". 
He said the EU should liberalise the visa regime to encourage the public.

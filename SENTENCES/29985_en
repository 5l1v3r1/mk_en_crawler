BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbia needs to achieve political stability and unity for further progress in its EU accession bid, Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said on Monday (April 18th) at an EP-Serbia inter-parliamentary meeting in Brussels.
He expressed hope that a joint parliamentary committee will be established soon after the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia is ratified by all EU member states.
Nearly two-thirds of the 27 states have approved the agreement.

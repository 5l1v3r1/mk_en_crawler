TIRANA, Albania -- US Ambassador John Withers and the US Embassy in Tirana have no links to the Chinese ammunition trade between Albania and Afghanistan, according to the US Office of the Inspector General.
Allegations concerning Withers and five embassy staff first surfaced in the media last summer.
"The Inspector General reviewed all evidence made available and found nothing to substantiate criminal or any other allegations concerning Department of State employees," State Department spokesman Robert Wood said on Wednesday (March 18th).

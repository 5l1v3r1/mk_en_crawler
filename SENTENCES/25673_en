ANKARA, Turkey -- President Abdullah Gul called for parliamentary consensus Monday (February 22nd) on possible constitutional reforms, after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Madrid that the government is working on a package of amendments. 
Erdogan said the measures would be put to a referendum if necessary. 
Parliament can amend the constitution, if the proposal is backed by 367 of 550 lawmakers. 
If it gets at least 330 votes, it can be put instead to a referendum. 
Amending the constitution is a key requirement in EU accession talks. 
The opposition has blocked previous attempts.

WASHINGTON, United States -- White House documents released on Tuesday (25 March) show that the administration plans to offer Turkey $8.5 billion in loans and loan guarantees. 
The measure, part of President George W Bush's war budget for Iraq, includes one billion dollars in direct grants. 
"The United States recognises that Turkey has some needs regardless of the level of their co-operation (in the war)," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
The measure could still face opposition in the US Congress.
In other news, Turkey's chief prosecutor says he no longer wants to shut down the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). 
Sabih Kanadoglu had asked the Constitutional Court to ban the AKP because it had elected Recep Tayyip Erdogan as chairman several months ago, despite a conviction that banned him from politics at the time. 
He now says recent amendments to the law have made Erdogan's appointment legal.

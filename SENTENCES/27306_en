SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Energy Minister Traycho Traykov said Sunday (January 31st) that Bulgaria and Turkey have signed a memorandum of understanding to make an existing gas pipeline connecting the two countries run in both directions while agreeing to build a new gas link between the countries. 
Traykov told Bulgarian National Radio that current gas supplies coming from Russia to Greece and Turkey can only flow in one direction, affecting Bulgaria's supply. 
Traykov added that Bulgarian gas supplier Bulgargaz and Turkey's Botas signed an agreement allowing Bulgaria to import natural gas from Turkey via the reversible link.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- BiH is not yet ready to hold war crimes trials in compliance with international legal standards, Senior Deputy High Representative Bernard Fassier wrote in a letter to the UN war crimes tribunal Thursday (23 September). 
"Any premature referral to BiH before January could even undermine the current efforts to create a judicial system capable of conducting war crimes trials," he warned. 
Fassier was responding to a request by UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte for the transfer of cases involving four Serbs to the BiH judiciary.
In other news Thursday, forensic experts said they have recovered the remains of 249 Srebrenica victims from a mass grave in Bljeceva. 
The bodies were initially buried elsewhere, but moved to Bljeceva to hide evidence of the atrocity.

KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban claimed responsibility Monday (January 25th) for a rocket attack against a NATO base in Kandahar, saying it targeted Bulgarian Defence Minister Nikolai Mladenov, who was visiting the base. 
The claim was posted on a Taliban website, and was quoted by the US-based group SITE. 
The terrorists said six rockets were fired at the airport, with one landing 200m from Mladenov, who was not injured. 
Four Bulgarian soldiers and at least two from Romania were hurt. 
After returning to Sofia, Mladenov told reporters that the Taliban missile could not have targeted a "specific person".

ATHENS, Greece -- As many as 100 hooded youths attacked a police station Saturday (December 13th) in Athens's Exarchia district, where a 15-year-old boy was killed December 6th in an incident that sparked a wave of riots across the country.
Police used tear gas to ward off the rampage.
Fire bombs were also reportedly thrown at branches of the Greek National Bank and Eurobank, as well as businesses and a government office.
Similar violence was reported in Thessaloniki, with local businesses and a gymnasium among the targets.
Earlier Saturday, thousands of young people gathered in Athens and Thessaloniki to protest the death of the boy, Alexis Grigoropoulos.
He and another teenager were throwing rocks and incendiary devices at a police car when an officer in the vehicle fired his gun, killing Grigoropoulos.
The policeman insists the death was an accident.
On Friday, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said "no" to early elections.
At a press conference in Brussels, Karamanlis vowed to guarantee the security of all Greek citizens.
In other news, an earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale rattled central Greece on Saturday, damaging several houses.
Its epicentre was 10km south of the city of Lamia.

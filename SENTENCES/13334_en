WASHINGTON, United States -- The Turkish economy is on the right track, especially after the 2001 crisis, World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz said Thursday (22 September). 
He noted that Turkey has succeeded in implementing certain reforms that could not have been imagined three or four years ago. 
Acknowledging several important economic tasks remain, he stressed that Ankara's economic progress is highly important both for itself and the entire region, especially for the Middle East. 
Wolfowitz vowed continued Bank assistance with the reform process.
Also Thursday, Turkish security forces killed three Kurdish rebels and wounded two in a shootout in the eastern city of Van. 
The clash came hours after the Kurdistan Workers' Party extended its one-month suspension of active operations until 3 October.

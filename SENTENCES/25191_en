THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said on Thursday (January 28th) that although he is ready to make an opening statement when his war crimes trial resumes in March, he needs more time, allegedly to pay legal fees.
Karadzic's trial began in October but was suspended almost immediately due to his refusal to attend the sessions.

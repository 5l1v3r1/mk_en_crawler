MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Construction crews completed work on the arch of a historic bridge in Mostar on Friday (22 August).
The Old Bridge was built in the 16th century but destroyed by artillery in November 1993.
Local residents and officials are viewing the reconstruction project as a symbolic act of reconciliation.
The rebuilt bridge is an exact replica of the old one, and all the stone used in the construction is hand-carved.

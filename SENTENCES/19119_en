BELGRADE, Serbia -- Politicians, officials and the media have expressed alarm over reports that two groups are planning to set up a Serb militia in Kosovo.
The Serbian Veterans' Movement and the United Serbian People's Movement said the volunteer force would consist of veterans of the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and would take up arms to prevent the secession of the province.
Zeljko Vasiljevic, head of the Veterans' Movement and a member of parliament, said the first company would be sworn in at a church service on Saturday (May 5th).
An interior ministry spokeswoman told reporters that forming an armed group is illegal, although holding a church service is not.
Srdjan Milivojevic of the reformist Democratic Party warned that forming a militia would be dangerous and illegal.
Even the extreme nationalist Radical Party has raised objections, with a leading member saying that while the party understood the motives behind the plan, it could backfire against Serbia.
Belgrade's Danas newspaper, meanwhile, said Serbia already has had a bitter experience with volunteer militias in the 1990s.

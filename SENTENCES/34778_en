PODGORICA, Serbia-Montenegro -- The Montenegrin police took over control of the federal state border from the army, police official Milan Paunovic announced on Saturday (9 August). 
The move follows last week's decision by the Supreme Defence Council of Serbia-Montenegro to hand over border control authority from the army to police forces. 
They will move into military facilities by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Boris Tadic said Serbian police would take over border control only after proper training was completed. 
He added that the practice of soldiers guarding the border is not common worldwide and should be replaced soon.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) told Bulgaria and Romania that they must implement major reforms in the next six months if they want to join the EU on 1 January 2007.
In its reports on the two countries' progress towards membership, released on Tuesday (25 October), the EC singled out organised crime and corruption as areas of particular concern.
Bulgaria and Romania are also expected to improve their veterinary controls, judiciaries and administrations.
The report suggests that Romania, seen until recently as lagging behind in the accession effort, has now caught up with Bulgaria.
EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn says Sofia may have lost momentum following last June's election and a nearly two-month delay in forming a cabinet.

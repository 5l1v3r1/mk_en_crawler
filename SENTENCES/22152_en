ANKARA, Turkey -- A court decided on Tuesday (November 18th) to release a retired petty officer who has languished in jail for 17 months as part of the operation against the shadowy separatist group Ergenekon.
Mahmut Ozturk is the first detainee in the controversial Ergenekon trial, which began in October, to receive his release.
A total of 85 people face charges of forming an illegal organisation that planned to incite chaos to trigger a coup against the pro-Islamic government.
Among them are retired army officers, leftist politicians, members of secularist associations, journalists, and academics who are known opponents of the ruling Justice and Development Party.

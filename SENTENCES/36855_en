BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- A plan for resolving problems in Kosovo will be presented at Monday's (12 July) meeting of the EU foreign ministers.
The plan, prepared by Austria in co-operation with Regional Strategy Partnership, focuses on giving more power to local Kosovo institutions in exchange for greater autonomy for the Serb minority.
Reaction in Serbia was mixed.
Federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic described it as a good starting point, while Belgrade's co-ordinator for Kosovo, Nebojsa Covic, said no more power should be given to local authorities.

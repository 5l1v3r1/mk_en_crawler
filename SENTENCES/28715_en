PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The model of South Tyrol in Italy is the likeliest model for resolving the issue of northern Kosovo, the Koha Ditore daily reported on Thursday (August 12th), quoting diplomatic sources.
According to the newspaper, the model of the northern Italian province has been discussed for some time now within diplomatic circles and that the governments of both Kosovo and Serbia seem open to it.
The same sources told the paper that the new arrangement would slightly modify the Ahtisaari Plan and give more financial autonomy in tax collection to the Serb-dominated north.
International diplomats say the goal of the new arrangement is to improve the lives of residents.
Both Kosovo and Serbia would be guarantors of the new arrangements, according to the report.

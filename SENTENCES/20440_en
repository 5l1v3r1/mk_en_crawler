ANKARA, Turkey -- Ahead of the US-sponsored peace conference between Israelis and Palestinians, scheduled to take place in the US in late November, both sides are gathering in Ankara on Monday (November 12th) for what is described as a rehearsal. 
Israeli President Shimon Peres arrived early Sunday, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is expected on Monday. 
Peres will address Turkey's parliament on Tuesday, the first Israeli president to speak before the legislature of a Muslim country. 
"I believe that Turkey can assume leadership for peace while at the same time fight against terrorism," Peres said in a weekend interview with CNN-Turk, referring to Turkey's fight against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party based in northern Iraq.

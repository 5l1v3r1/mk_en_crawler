PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Leaders rejected any possibility Sunday (November 30th) of Serbian security forces returning to Kosovo. 
They left in 1999 in the wake of the Kumanovo Agreement, a military accord between Belgrade and NATO on the withdrawal of former Yugoslav troops and police from Kosovo. 
Pristina says the agreement should remain as is, arguing that Serbia still represents a risk to safety and security. 
President Fatmir Sejdiu said any changes to the accord are unacceptable. 
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said Serbian leaders can talk about developments in their own country but that Kosovo has its own army, security forces and NATO. 
Their comments were in response to some by Serbian President Boris Tadic. 
In an interview with the Belgrade-based daily Politika on Saturday, he said Serbia has proved to be a stabilising factor in the region and that the Kumanovo Agreement deserves review.
In other news, Ramush Haradinaj won re-election on Sunday as leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) party. 
The AAK also added publisher Blerim Shala to its ranks. 
He will likely assume the post of party deputy leader alongside Haradinaj's brother, Daut Haradinaj. 
A former UN official in Kosovo, Steven Schook, agreed to become an adviser to the AAK leader.

ATHENS, Greece -- Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said on Sunday (April 3rd) that the regime of Muammar Gaddafi is looking for a solution to the conflict in Libya. 
He made this statement after Prime Minister George Papandreou met with Libyan envoy and acting Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi, who arrived in Athens at the request of Libyan authorities. 
"We reiterated the clear message of the international community -- full respect and implementation of the UN resolutions, immediate cease-fire, and ending violence and hostilities, particularly against civilians in Libya," Droutsas said after meeting with the Libyan official, who is travelling on to Turkey.

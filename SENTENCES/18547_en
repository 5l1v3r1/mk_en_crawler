BUCHAREST, Romania -- New Justice Minister Tudor Chiuariu demanded on Tuesday (May 8th) that the High Magistrate Council sack a key prosecutor, Doru Tulus, for alleged incompetence. 
The request is controversial, however, as Tulus is the deputy chief prosecutor of the National Anticorruption Division (DNA), and has been in charge of key corruption probes, including ones against Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu and the ethnic Hungarian UDMR's chairman, Marko Bella. 
DNA chief Daniel Morar told reporters that Chiuariu went around him with the request.

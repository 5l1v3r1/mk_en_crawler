ANKARA, Turkey -- A court in Istanbul pressed charges Thursday (October 28th) against nine officers suspected of blackmail and transmitting military secrets, local media reported. 
The investigation that led to the charges followed a police probe earlier this year, which looked into the activities of a group suspected of secretly filming and blackmailing high-ranking navy and other officials. 
No official comment on the investigation has been issued. 
Local media, however, said CDs have been seized containing sensitive military information that may have been sold to foreign intelligence agencies.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- The IMF Resident Representative to Serbia, Harald Hirschhofer, called on Friday (January 26th) for the continuation and acceleration of structural reforms. 
He stressed that in the long run, such reforms would boost employment and bring prosperity to Serbia. 
On the other hand, he warned, failure to proceed with them would make the local economy less competitive. 
Companies that are not restructured would burden both the private sector and fiscal policy, he said.

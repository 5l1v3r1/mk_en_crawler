PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who led his country through the conflicts of the 1990s to eventual independence, has decided to step down. 
The move comes on the heels of an impressive election victory by the Djukanovic-led Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and its allies.
President Filip Vujanovic announced the resignation on Tuesday (October 3rd). 
He said Djukanovic's reasons for stepping down were personal and his decision was final, although he planned to keep his post of party chairman. 
DPS leaders will meet on Thursday to nominate a new candidate for prime minister.

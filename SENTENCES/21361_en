PRISTINA, Kosovo -- UNMIK can hold talks with Belgrade only on technical and practical issues but not on anything related to Kosovo's independence and sovereignty, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Wednesday (July 30th) after meeting with UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier. 
"I want to make clear that this is not a dialogue or negotiations, but they are meetings within the mandate and competencies of Mr. 
Zannier," Thaci said. 
Zannier said he will follow instructions from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 
He noted his approach is practical and aims at resolving problems.

Bogdanovic insisted on it Wednesday during a meeting with Zannier in Pristina. 
They also discussed police and judicial issues in the Serb-dominated areas of northern Kosovo.

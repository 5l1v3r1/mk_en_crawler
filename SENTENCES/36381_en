BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The Turkey-EU Partnership Council met on Tuesday (18 May) in Brussels, prior to the completion of the EU Commission's Progress Report on Turkey, due to be published before the end of the year.
Afterwards, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen and Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul held a joint press conference.
Verheugen commended Turkish authorities for the recent adoption of constitutional changes, saying they represent a big step towards meeting the Copenhagen political criteria for EU membership.
In other developments, the US State Department published its 2003-2004 human rights report, acknowledging the series of reforms Turkey has made in this area.
The report notes, however, that the military continues to exert strong influence on the political process.

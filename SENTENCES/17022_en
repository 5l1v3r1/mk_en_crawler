SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bakir Izetbegovic, the son of former BiH leader Alija Izetbegovic, is expected to take over as leader of the main Bosniak party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Nezavisne Novine reported Thursday (November 2nd), quoting an unnamed party official. 
The same source says the move is due to poor election results. 
The SDA remains the most powerful party in the Federation of BiH after parliamentary elections last month, but current leader Sulejman Tihic lost his bid for re-election as the Bosniak member of the tripartite presidency. 
Bakir Izetbegovic would only confirm that the party has internal problems.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Interior Minister Georgi Petkanov said Thursday (16 October) that the Bulgarian military would train Iraqi police and security officers. 
The training would most likely be conducted at the Police Academy in Sofia or other Bulgarian schools and be financed by the Sofia municipality budget. 
Washington wants more Iraqi policemen trained and has discussed the idea with several central European countries.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Monday (October 8th) he would allow politicians one more round of negotiations to strike a deal on police reform.
He voiced hope that progress would be made by the end of this week.
His comment came during a meeting with members of three NGOs that have pledged full support for a proposal drafted by Lajcak.
Separately Monday, BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic said the police reform accord he signed with Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik is the most that can be achieved in the present political climate.
Lajcak has rejected the accord.

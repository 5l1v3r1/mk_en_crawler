TIRANA, Albania -- The OSCE representative in Albania, Robert Bosch, urged political parties on Sunday (March 2nd) to choose an electoral system that features closed candidate lists, in which voters back parties on the ballot, rather than particular candidates for office.
"I hope that the political parties will find a compromise on election reform very soon since time is short.
There are parliamentary elections next year and some issues must be solved, like the election system, the voter registry, voting commissions ...
and there should be no open lists," Bosch said in Shkodra, northern Albania.
The Democratic Party and the Socialist Party agree with the change, but smaller parties advocate retaining the open lists.
A special commission on reforms meets on Monday to discuss the electoral system.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Opposition parties criticised on Wednesday (September 5th) the government's proposed amendment to the elections law. 
The main opposition Social Democratic Alliance for Macedonia threatened a parliamentary boycott if the proposal is not withdrawn. 
The main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration, submitted 4,100 counter proposals to the amendment Wednesday.
The cabinet's bill would boost the number of seats in parliament from 120 to 133, providing more representation for smaller minority groups and the diaspora.

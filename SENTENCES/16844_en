ANKARA, Turkey -- Paying her first official visit as German Chancellor, Angela Merkel met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday (October 5th).
While expressing support for Turkey's EU bid, Merkel stressed that unless the country grants trade privileges to EU member Cyprus, accession talks would be affected, possibly even suspended.
Erdogan responded that Ankara would fulfil its commitment only when the EU implements its pledge to ease the international isolation of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
In other news, local media reports suggest that the first Turkish peacekeepers will be deployed to Lebanon next week, becoming the first Muslim forces to join the UNIFIL.
A Turkish frigate will join the international naval forces.

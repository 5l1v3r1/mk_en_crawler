TIRANA, Albania -- Kicking off a three-day visit to Tirana on Monday (24 October), the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Rene van der Linden, urged authorities to step up the fight against corruption. 
Meeting with Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli, van der Linden suggested that domestic legislation could be adjusted to include stiffer penalties for corrupt officials and politicians.
Separately Monday, a US organisation, the Albanian-American Enterprise Fund, called on the Albanian government to focus on the rule of law, transparency, and anticorruption efforts.

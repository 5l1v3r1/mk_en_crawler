WASHINGTON, United States -- The White House welcomed on Friday (September 26th) the ratification of Albania's and Croatia's NATO accession protocols by the US Senate. 
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said that both countries participate actively in joint military operations with NATO and its allies and that their forthcoming accession to the Alliance will help close a dark chapter of Balkan history. 
Perino expressed hope that Macedonia will also join NATO once it settles its long-standing name dispute with Greece.

ATHENS, Greece -- Greece plans to open a new minimum-security prison outside Athens for cases involving foreigners during the Summer Olympics. 
Addressing parliament Friday (18 June), Justice Minster Anastasios Papaligouras said the facility would be used to temporarily house up to 250 minor offenders, who would be deported rather than sentenced to jail terms in Greece.
In other news, Greek President Kostis Stephanopoulos arrived in Austria Saturday for private talks with outgoing Austrian President Thomas Klestil. 
On Sunday, Stephanopoulos is due to depart on official visit to Azerbaijan.

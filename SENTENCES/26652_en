TIRANA, Albania -- Ambassadors representing EU countries in Tirana are urging political leaders to find a way to entice opposition lawmakers back into parliament.
A mutual compromise is needed to end this situation, German Ambassador to Albania Bernd Borchardt said on Monday (November 9th), after a meeting with seven other European representatives in Tirana, marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Austrian diplomat Florian Rauning said that if Albania wants to be part of Europe, it must resolve its own issues instead of waiting for a solution from outside.
Lawmakers in the opposition Socialist Party have been boycotting parliament for weeks, demanding an investigation into alleged violations that occurred during the June 28th general elections.

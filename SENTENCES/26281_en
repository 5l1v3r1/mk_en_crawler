SKOPJE, Macedonia -- US Ambassador to Macedonia Philip Reeker on Sunday (October 11th) again urged Macedonia and Greece to settle their name dispute as soon as possible.
In an interview with Radio Free Europe, he said a mutually acceptable solution is possible.
Commenting on the Macedonian government's reaction to tensions provoked by certain content in Macedonia's first encyclopaedia, the US official said it was key that Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Ali Ahmeti, leader of the junior ruling coalition partner Democratic Union for Integration, met to discuss the problem.
They agreed that the publication should not affect interethnic relations.
Ethnic Albanians were angry over the way they were portrayed in the original versions of the encyclopaedia, parts of which are now being re-written.

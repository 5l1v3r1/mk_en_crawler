CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Greece scored its first victory in a World Cup championship on Thursday (June 17th), beating Nigeria 2-1. 
The African team scored first, but their game changed about 15 minutes later when one of their players got a red card for kicking a Greek player. 
Ten minutes later, the Greeks scored, and followed with another goal 71 minutes in. 
From Brussels, where he was attending an EU summit, Prime Minister George Papandreou cheered the win, describing it as a "glimmer of light" after months of "bad" economic news. 
He even delayed his post-summit press conference to watch the end of the game. 
"The boys on the national team made us proud," Papandreou said.

The EXIT festival, dubbed Europe's 4th largest rock party, drew much comment on the Serbian blogs this week Many were wowed by former Smiths singer Morrissey's performance.
"He is a tormented man, a poet of the utmost intimate feelings and thoughts, and he won't push you to see all that," writes Nemiri on Mojblog.
"By not faking his own feelings he showed respect to this audience in his own way … you can't buy that with a festival ticket".
In Croatia, Fantasista reflects on the World Cup.
A national team's mentality mirrors the situation in the country, he argues.
"Croatia, it's a special story … 4.5 million people and as many coaches.
There was national unity when the Croatian national team got beaten by Brazil, but then they lashed out at each other after a draw against Australia."
And Serbia-Montenegro?
"Well, the union fell apart and the same thing happened to their team."
Albania has been the scene of anti-government street rallies, and Our Man in Tirana is there with a first-hand report.
"It is worth remembering that staging peaceful political protests is not something to be taken for granted," he notes.
"Even in Western societies, public protests are often burdened with the potential for conflict and violence.
So it was good to see that the demonstration was well-organised, well-managed and well-policed."
But will it make a difference, Our Man asks?
"Not until Albanian politicians adopt a less confrontational and more co-operative approach to the practice of politics, something President Moisiu has been calling for."
Meanwhile, Bulgarian blogger Plamen Popov has noticed a disturbing phenomenon -- gangs extorting money from tourists.
"A young guy with a gun tucked in his belt drives a dune buggy around the beachfront collecting 5 levs for each tent in exchange for protection.
It is not difficult to guess what will happen if you refuse to pay!" Popov writes.
Despite a spate of scandals involving such racketeering, municipalities continue to lease beaches to these self-described concessionaries.
Why?
Popov asks.
"Do they want these men to force people to sit under the umbrellas and on the easy chairs, if need be by beating them up first?
Do they want these dozens of little bars on the beaches which dispose of their waste in holes drilled right next to the waterline?
Do they want these people to torment us with their favorite pop folk tunes?"
On a brighter note, rural areas in Romania now boast high-quality mobile phone signals via the Cosmote network, writes Andreea Mira.
"This is a good thing -- on the one hand, the company has found a niche:
the villagers, an underprivileged market segment, that other such companies have so far not made use of.
"On the other hand, these villages, which lack other means of communication, now have the chance to enjoy [mobile] telephony service," Mira writes.
That concludes this week's roundup.

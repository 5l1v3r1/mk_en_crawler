BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Bosnian Serb authorities announced on Thursday (31 March) that prosecutors are investigating nearly 900 officials to establish whether they were implicated in the Srebrenica massacre.
A special commission has drawn up a list of suspects at the request of Paddy Ashdown, the top international officer in BiH.
The Republika Srpska (RS) government said the move reflects its "determination and commitment to meet all obligations to clarify the July 1995 events in Srebrenica".
In other news Thursday, the RS government confirmed that it would provide release on bail guarantees for five persons indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal.
All five -- Gojko Jankovic, Savo Todovic, Drago Nikolic, Vinko Pandurevic and Mico Stanisic -- surrendered this year.

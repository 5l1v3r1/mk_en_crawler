BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- On Wednesday (16 July), Deputy High Representative Donald Hays criticised the pace of reform in Republika Srpska (RS). 
During a meeting with Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic, Hays said the entity's domestic debt exceeds 2.3 billion euros, and urged officials to make the tax administration and public enterprises more efficient. 
He cited the recently uncovered mismanagement at the local utility company Elektroprivreda. 
After the talks, Mikerevic announced that the government planned to apply "shock therapy" at Elektroprivreda to resolve its problems. 
He added that he and Hays had agreed on the need to accelerate the privatisation process in RS.

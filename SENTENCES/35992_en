SOFIA, Bulgaria -- US companies General Dynamics and Northrop are interested in Bulgaria's military plants, Deputy Economy Minister Radoslav Bozadjiev said Tuesday (30 March).
He explained that since Bulgaria has formally joined NATO, the country's defence industry would largely rely on orders from Alliance countries to boost output and modernise military plants.
In other news, Bulgarian border police signed a co-operation agreement with the Turkish Coast Guard on Tuesday.
It is aimed at preventing violations of land borders, territorial waters and economic zones.

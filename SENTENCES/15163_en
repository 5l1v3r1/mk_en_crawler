TIRANA, Albania -- The High Council of Justice (HCJ) warned in a statement Thursday (29 June) that the main political parties -- the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party -- are trying to put political pressure on its work with regard to the election of one member of the Central Elections Commission.
The HCJ says it is unable to effectively complete this task and has asked both parties to respect the legal procedures involved.
There are three vacant seats on the seven-member commission.

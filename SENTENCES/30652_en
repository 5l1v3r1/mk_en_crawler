ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Several thousand journalists gathered at the Taksim Square in Istanbul on Sunday (March 13th) to protest the arrest of 68 journalists.
They particularly called for the release of seven colleagues, detained for suspected involvement in the so-called Ergenekon plot to topple the government.
The protestors also demanded more media freedom in the country.
NGOs supported the rally.

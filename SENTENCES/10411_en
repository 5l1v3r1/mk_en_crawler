SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg said Friday (19 November) the government would adopt the EU membership action plan for 2005 by mid-December.
He added that the European Commission' (EC) recent strategy paper on the country indicated that the European Council will decide at its December summit whether Bulgaria has formally completed accession talks.
Sofia has closed all accession chapters.
In other news Friday, Bulgarian Finance Minister Milen Velchev and EC representatives signed a memorandum on the financing of Bulgarian-Turkish infrastructure projects.
These include the E80 motorway, linking the southeast Bulgarian town of Malko Turnovo with the Turkish border.
Also Friday, Bulgarian authorities released Romanian journalist George Buhnic on bail.
He was detained at the Bulgarian-Romanian border last week for spying.
He says he was conducting an undercover investigation.
He will have to remain in Bulgaria until the case is heard in court.

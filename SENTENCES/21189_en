TIRANA, Albania -- Authorities announced on Thursday (January 31st) that the introduction of new procedures to issue Macedonian visas to Albanian citizens has been postponed. 
The changes were to take effect on Friday. 
A police spokesperson says for now, Albanian citizens will continue to receive their visas at the border, instead of at the Macedonian Embassy in Tirana, as was proposed.
Democratic Party of Albanians leader Menduh Thaci told Albania's Top Channel television station that Skopje is asking Albania for an overall removal of the visa regime through the signing of a bilateral agreement. 
According to Thaci, representatives of the two countries will meet in Skopje on Monday to discuss that. 
Macedonia announced at the beginning of the year that it will introduce visa restrictions for the citizens of more than 140 countries as part of the country's obligations as an EU aspirant.

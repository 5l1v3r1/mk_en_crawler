ANKARA, Turkey -- Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told parliament Wednesday (13 April) that the government has proposed Armenia and Turkey set up a joint panel to examine allegations of genocide against Armenians in Turkey during World War I. 
The proposal was outlined in a letter sent to Armenian President Robert Kocharian. 
Armenia contends that 1.5 million Armenians were killed between 1915 and 1917.
Also Wednesday, Turkey and Bulgaria announced plans to open a new border checkpoint in June. 
The crossing will be an alternative to the existing crossing at Kapikule.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Political leaders must ramp up their efforts to launch open and frank dialogue and achieve consensus on important issues, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Thursday (November 27th).
After meeting with Presidency member Haris Silajdzic about the conclusions of a November 18th PIC Steering Board meeting on the situation in BiH, Lajcak issued a statement saying "BiH has significant international, especially EU, attention, which can help unlock reform processes." These reforms are key to BiH's EU integration process and to eventually closing the Office of the High Representative.
In other news Thursday, the BiH presidency decided that the country's military contingent in Iraq should be withdrawn December 15th.
Almost 90 Bosnian troops are deployed with coalition forces in Iraq.
The first Bosnian troops arrived in June 2005.

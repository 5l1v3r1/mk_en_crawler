THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Vojislav Seselj wants two months to decide how to conduct his defence at The Hague war crimes tribunal, his legal adviser, Zoran Krasic, told a press conference Sunday (August 24th). 
The UN tribunal has been insisting on appointing an official attorney for Seselj, who has declined the offer. 
"If the court needed two months to write down this requirement, then Seselj also needs two months to reply to it," Krasic said. 
According to him, the pre-trial investigation violated 78 of Seselj's human rights. 
The leader of the Serbian Radical Party leader is facing charges of inciting nationalism and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, along with murder, torture, imprisonment and deportation.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan phoned US President George W. 
Bush on Friday (October 5th) and asked him to step up efforts against a resolution in the US Congress which upholds Armenian claims of genocide by the Ottoman empire. 
The resolution, describing the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 as genocide, is to move to a congressional committee on Wednesday. 
Erdogan reportedly warned Bush that passage of the resolution would seriously harm Turkish-US relations. 
Bush reportedly assured Erdogan that his administration continues to work against its adoption.

ZAGREB, Croatia -- Prime Minister Ivo Sanader of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) may get the mandate to form a cabinet as early as this week, if he secures support from the Croatian Peasant Party and the Social Liberal Party (HSS-HSLS) coalition.
The HDZ confirmed Wednesday (November 28th) that talks with the coalition are underway.
Together, the HDZ and the HSS-HSLS would have 74 of the 77 seats necessary for a parliamentary majority.
Support from two members representing ethnic minorities would then give an HDZ-led government at least 76 seats.
If Serbian minority representatives also join, it would have 79 seats.
However, the chairman of the left-wing opposition Social Democrats also claims to have secured a parliamentary majority.
Zoran Milanovic told Vecernji list that an announcement can be expected within the next few days.

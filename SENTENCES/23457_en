ANKARA, Turkey -- The terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has dispatched three suicide bombers to attack major Turkish cities, police officials were quoted by media as saying on Tuesday (April 28th).
Sources say the Security General Directorate has warned provincial police departments to step up security measures and boost intelligence efforts to capture the suspects.
In other news Tuesday, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler confirmed reports that the far-left militant group Revolutionary Headquarters, whose hideout in Istanbul police controversially raided on Monday, has links to the PKK.
The organisation collaborates with the PKK in training terrorists and other areas, Guler told a news conference.
Monday's raid left three people dead and seven injured.
It was part of a broader anti-terror operation against Revolutionary Headquarters in six provinces.
Also Tuesday, anti-terror police captured a PKK member carrying 35kg of A-4 explosives in the southern province of Mersin.
Authorities believe the suspect was planning a massive bombing.
Meanwhile, Kurdish rebels are blamed for a land mine that exploded on Wednesday as an armoured personnel carrier passed in the southern province of Diyarbakir.
At least nine Turkish soldiers died in what the BBC describes as the deadliest attack on security forces in months.

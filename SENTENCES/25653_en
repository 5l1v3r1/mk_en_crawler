ANKARA, Turkey -- The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) presented its package of 26 constitutional amendments to parliament on Monday (March 22nd). 
The pro-Islamic government is giving lawmakers three days to deliberate on the proposed items, before the amendments take final shape. 
The main opposition People's Republic Party and the National Movement Party have rejected the package outright, forcing the AKP to take the package to referendum. 
Polls suggest the public will pass it. 
Some senior judges are balking at the amendments, accusing the AKP of using liberal reforms to cover efforts to strengthen religious rule.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Croatian lawmaker Branimir Glavas was detained on Wednesday (May 13th) based on an international arrest warrant issued by Croatia. 
But because he holds dual Bosnian-Croatian citizenship, he cannot be extradited to Croatia, as BiH does not extradite its citizens abroad. 
Glavas fled to BiH after being sentenced last week to ten years in prison for war crimes committed against Serb civilians during Croatia's war of independence in the early 1990s. 
In an interview with the Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz on Tuesday, Glavas said that he is ready to stand trial again but only if it is in BiH.

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The Sofia court of appeals upheld on Friday (19 May) a lower court ruling that restores Krasimir Nedelchev as deputy director of the state agricultural fund.
Nedelchev was charged with corruption and taking 192,000 euros in return for not obstructing projects under the SAPARD programme.
The court said evidence of that was inconclusive.
The fund already has been sanctioned by the European Commission, which discovered that funding was disbursed for projects not yet approved.

THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- At a pre-trial hearing Thursday (17 June) to discuss the defence phase of his trial, former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to fight "the most terrible accusations" he faces, including genocide.
His defence starts on 5 July.
On Wednesday, the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague gave a boost to prosecutors, ruling there was sufficient evidence to support the charges of genocide.
"There existed a joint criminal enterprise, which included members of the Bosnian Serb leadership," the tribunal said, ruling that Milosevic must answer charges that he participated.

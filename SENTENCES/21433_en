BELGRADE, Serbia -- Legislators failed to elect a speaker Tuesday (June 24th), mainly due to the Serbian Radical Party and the Democratic Party-New Serbia coalition complained about the manner in which the session was called.
They said acting Speaker Jovan Krkobabic failed to consult first with leaders of the parliamentary caucuses.
The session resumes on Wednesday.
Also Tuesday, Serbian President Boris Tadic, leader of the Democratic Party, failed to announce the name of the prime minister-designate as expected.
Party leaders have been discussing various candidates for the post.

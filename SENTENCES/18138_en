BELGRADE, Serbia -- Outgoing Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, chairman of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), criticised on Friday (February 16th) the sentences handed down in a retrial for the 1999 murders of four SPO officials and his own attempted murder along the Ibar Highway. 
Earlier Friday, a Belgrade court sentenced former special police unit chief Milorad Ulemek, also known as "Legija", and a subordinate Nenad Ilic to 15 years. 
The other eight officials, including former State Security chief Rade Markovic, received prison terms ranging from nine months to 14 years. 
Two defendants were acquitted. 
Draskovic described the sentences as "an award for the massacre". 
He also said he would request a probe into allegations that Judge Bojan Misic, who issued Friday's ruling, had been trained as an army soldier by Ulemek in Vukovar during the 1991 conflict in Croatia.

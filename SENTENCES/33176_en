BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro -- Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic said Sunday (15 June) that the police would have no problem arresting Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic if he is found in Serbia. 
However, Mihajlovic said there is no indication that Mladic is still in the country. 
Chief UN Prosecutor Carla del Ponte has said repeatedly that she has evidence that the general is hiding in Serbia-Montenegro. 
Mladic and Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic remain the two top suspects wanted by the tribunal who are still at large.(AFP - 15/06/03)

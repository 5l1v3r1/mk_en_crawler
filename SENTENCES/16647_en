BUCHAREST, Romania -- The new head of the European Commission (EC) Delegation to Bucharest, Ambassador Donato Chiarini, presented his credentials to President Traian Basescu on Tuesday (November 7th).
Basescu's office says the two discussed the EU entry of Romania and Bulgaria in January.
Starting then, the current EC Delegation in Romania would be transformed into an EC Representation.
Chiarini said a top priority would be improved communication and knowledge of EU matters among the Romanian public.

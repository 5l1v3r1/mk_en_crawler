PARIS, France -- Police have arrested 13 Turkish Kurds on charges of money laundering for the purpose of financing a terrorist organisation.
According to investigators, the suspects were channeling money to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
The operation began in July 2006 when two Kurds were arrested in Paris after attempting to convert 200,000 euros into US dollars.

BUCHAREST, Romania -- A hearing to settle a territorial dispute between Romania and Ukraine begins on Tuesday (September 2nd) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Romanian media reported.
At issue is tiny Serpents' Island, which is rich in natural gas and oil.
The suit also covers the legal border of the island, an area of about 12,000 square km, with oil and gas exploitation opportunities.
The matter has been subject to negotiations since 1998;
a settlement deadline of 2004 came and went.
A related bilateral agreement gave Romania the right to appeal to the ICJ if the issue remained in dispute after two years.

SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Parliament passed the amended law on the national ombudsman Wednesday (25 June). 
The constitutional amendment changes the position and status of the national ombudsman and strengthens the position organisationally. 
Under the law, part of the Ohrid peace agreement, the 120 members of parliament would elect an ombudsman with a two-thirds majority.
In other news, a poll conducted earlier this month by the US International Republican Institute and published Wednesday shows a decline in public support for all political parties. 
Compared to a similar survey conducted in April, it showed a 9 per cent increase in the number of people dissatisfied with government and an 18 per cent increase among those complaining about their quality of life.

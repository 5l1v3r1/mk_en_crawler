PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Authorities have issued warrants for 11 people on charges of human trafficking after police announced on Sunday (October 25th) they have identified those responsible for the tragedy earlier this month in Hungary's Tisa River. 
At least two Kosovo Albanians drowned and 18 others went missing when a boat transporting illegal immigrants sank. 
The immigrants were attempting to cross the river from Serbia. 
Police sources say two Kosovo police investigators and a EULEX prosecutor travelled to Hungary to collect further information and meet with Hungarian authorities.
In other news, TV commercials promoting Kosovo's image will start airing on Monday as part of a two-year campaign. 
A 60-second commercial will be shown on TV networks around the world, including CNN, BBC World News, Euronews, CNN Turk, Bloomberg and Eurosport. 
Later, the advertisements will be published in The Economist and Newsweek. 
The campaign is being conducted by the consortium BBR Saatchi and Saatchi, which won a 5.7m-euro contract to promote Kosovo.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Speaking on Monday (9 June), High Representative Paddy Ashdown urged Bosnians to rethink the role and the functions of the public administration, calling it "outdated, overstaffed, unresponsive and inefficient". 
He called for broad public debate on administrative problems and possible changes to the constitution. 
His comments coincided with the release of a UNDP report, which surveyed three groups of respondents -- citizens, civil servants and members of the business community. 
All three groups were critical of the public administration in terms of efficiency and cost-to-benefit principles.

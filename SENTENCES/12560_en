PRISTINA, Kosovo, Serbia-Montenegro -- A bomb exploded in front of a building that houses Kosovo's Ministry of Returns and the headquarters of the Serbian Democratic Party on Monday (4 July). 
Authorities said there were no injuries, though the building suffered significant damage. 
The ministry is headed by Slavisa Petkovic, who is also chairman of the party that shares the same premises. 
He is the only Serb minister in the Kosovo cabinet. 
The attack followed weekend blasts targeting UN, OSCE and Kosovo government buildings. 
EU security chief Javier Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn issued separate statements though their spokespersons Monday, denouncing those blasts and noting they would be taken into consideration when evaluating the implementation of standards in Kosovo.

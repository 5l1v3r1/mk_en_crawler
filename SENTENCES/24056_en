THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has scheduled the first official meeting between its representatives and those of Macedonia and Greece for January 19th, the Macedonian foreign ministry confirmed on Wednesday (December 17th). 
Skopje initiated the case last month. 
It argues that by blocking Macedonia's NATO bid over the long-standing name dispute, Athens has broken a bilateral interim accord signed in 1995. 
The meeting next month will focus on procedural issues.

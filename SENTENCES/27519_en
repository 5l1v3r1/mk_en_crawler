SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Public Revenue Office Director Goran Trajkovski confirmed at a press conference Friday (November 26th) that the audit of six companies registered at the same address as the private A1 TV channel was carried out as part of a tax fraud investigation.
He said the firms are suspected of illegally sending abroad 7.5m euros.
Trajkovski added that agents investigating financial crimes were denied access to the financial records of the companies for months.
Separately, Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska announced that police seized 100,000 euros in cash from an apartment in Skopje owned by a manager of one of the companies.
She also reiterated that A1 TV was not the target of the inspections.
The broadcaster claimed that Thursday's raid on the building was politically motivated.
Journalists complained that they were prevented from doing their jobs as police officers sealed the entrance of the building.
Branko Crvenkovski, leader of the main opposition SDSM, called for a demonstration later this week to protest the raid.

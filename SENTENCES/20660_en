ZAGREB, Croatia -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and EU Integration denies reports that it has held official talks with Slovenia regarding ongoing disputes. 
On Wednesday (August 8th), Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic said that while teams from the two countries have met, it was only at the "consultation" level. 
Disagreements over maritime borders were reportedly discussed. 
Other issues involve $600m Croatians had deposited in Ljubljanska Banka, one of the largest Slovenian banks. 
In 1989, it announced it could not return foreign currency deposits.
The last major issue is ownership of the Krcko nuclear plant, which the two countries built together. 
Slovenia has threatened to block Croatia's EU accession process, unless the various issues are resolved.

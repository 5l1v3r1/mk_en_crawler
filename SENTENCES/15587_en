ATHENS, Greece -- The tenth bilateral co-operation meeting between Greece and Turkey was held on Thursday (25 May) in Athens, as the two NATO members exchanged criticism over a midair collision between Greek and Turkish fighter planes earlier this week. 
Despite the incident, the focus of the meeting remained on improving ties, especially in "the economic, technical, cultural and social arenas", the Greek foreign ministry said.
Also on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul announced that the two countries would soon launch a hotline between their air forces, to prevent a repetition of the aircraft incident.

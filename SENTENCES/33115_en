SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Forensic experts have exhumed 232 bodies from a mass grave discovered several weeks ago, the country's commission on missing persons reported on Wednesday (18 June). 
The grave is located near Vlasenica, an area captured by Serb forces in the early part of the 1992-1995 conflict. 
Many of the town's Muslim residents were moved to the nearby prison camp of Susica and were subsequently executed.

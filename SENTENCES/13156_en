BUCHAREST, Romania -- Relations between Romania and China are very good and prospects for economic co-operation are remarkable, Foreign Minster Mihai Razvan Ungureanu said on Tuesday (29 November), after wrapping up a visit to China. 
Noting that economic ties were the focus of talks with Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing, Ungureanu said they also hammered out most details of President Traian Basescu's visit to China in 2006.

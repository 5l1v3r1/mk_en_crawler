ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and visiting Iraqi counterpart Nuri al-Maliki vowed on Wednesday (December 24th) to step up their co-operation in the fight against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
"We should not allow terrorist organisations, in particular the PKK, to weaken our relations," al-Maliki told a joint press conference with Erdogan in Ankara.
"Terrorism is our common concern," Erdogan said.
He praised Baghdad's recognition of the PKK as a terrorist organisation earlier this year, saying consensus on this issue is an important milestone in relations.
The two prime ministers agreed to meet once a year to assess efforts against the PKK and discussed the establishment of a joint Supreme Council of Strategic Co-operation, announced during Erdogan's visit to Baghdad in July.
Later Wednesday, PKK militants opened fire on a military vehicle in the Turkish town of Cizre in the south-eastern province of Sirnak, killing three soldiers and injuring at least 13 others.
Four of the wounded are in critical condition.

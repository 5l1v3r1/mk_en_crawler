ATHENS, Greece -- The government's economic team has launched preparations for work on next year's state budget, according to a report Wednesday (30 July) in the <I>Kathimerini</I> daily.
The team has to review the requests of individual ministries, some of which reportedly are calling for significant increases in funds allotted to them.
The task is further complicated by the huge costs associated with hosting the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
Also Wednesday, Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis warned against the easing of euro budget rules, referring specifically to moves by France and Germany.

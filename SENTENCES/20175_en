TIRANA, Albania -- After meeting with ODHIR observer mission in Tirana head Nikolai Vulchanov on Wednesday (February 13th), a handful of small political parties dropped their demand for open candidate lists in the next elections. 
They also expressed their readiness to negotiate with the two big parties, the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party. 
The smaller parties are the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Alliance Party, the Socialist Movement for Integration, the Demo-Christian Party, and the Republican Party parties. 
They had threatened to block key electoral reforms unless their concerns were addressed.

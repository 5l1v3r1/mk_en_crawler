SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik threatened on Saturday (October 11th) that the entity will secede from BiH if he is removed from his post. 
In an interview with RS television in Banja Luka, Dodik said he has a plan, should High Representative Miroslav Lajcak dismiss him. 
If that happens, "I will lead RS to the road of independence," Dodik said. 
In a statement Friday, Lajcak warned BiH politicians to stop making unilateral threats against the Dayton Peace Accord and instead focus on the country's EU priorities.
In other news, police arrested three men Saturday for allegedly planting an explosive device in a Vitez supermarket last week. 
The device exploded on Thursday, killing one person and injuring five others.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias has accepted an invitation to meet with newly elected Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu, government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou announced in a statement Saturday (May 22nd). 
Both will attend a dinner Tuesday with UN special adviser on Cyprus Alexander Downer, effectively the first meeting of the two leaders since Eroglu's election last month. 
Talks on reunifying the divided island are set to resume on Wednesday after a two-month break for those elections.

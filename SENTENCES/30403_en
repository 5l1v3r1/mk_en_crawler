NEW YORK, United States/ANKARA, Turkey -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Saturday (January 15th) that all concerned parties should encourage Turkish and Greek Cypriots in their efforts to find a settlement to the long-standing Cypriot issue. 
His remarks came days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Cyprus and criticised the Turkish Cypriots for lack of effort towards finding an agreement. 
On Friday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Merkel to apologise for her criticism against Turkey.

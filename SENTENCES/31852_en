ANKARA, Turkey -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell met with officials in Turkey on Wednesday (2 April), attempting to mend strained relations and convince Ankara not to send troops into northern Iraq. 
Analysts say there are growing fears of a "war within a war" if Turkish and Kurdish forces clash.
Before flying on to Brussels to meet with NATO officials, Powell will stop in Belgrade to meet with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic. 
Aides say he will assure them of US backing for democratic reforms within the loose union, rocked by last month's assassination of Zoran Djindjic. 
The ongoing crackdown against organised crime will likely be discussed. 
Powell is also to pay his respects to Djindjic's widow.

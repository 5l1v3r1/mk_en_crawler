BELGRADE, Serbia -- Police raided two locations in Belgrade and a mountain tourism centre near Arandjelovac on Tuesday (November 2nd) in an unsuccessful search for former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.
One person was detained for questioning.
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says the police action, targeting people that may belong to Mladic's support network, stems from Serbia's co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
He reiterated that the government is determined to co-operate fully.
Authorities recently raised the reward for information leading to the capture of the longtime fugitive to 10m euros, up from the previous 1m euros.
Dacic said Tuesday's raids were based on previously gathered security data, and not on any reward-related tip.
